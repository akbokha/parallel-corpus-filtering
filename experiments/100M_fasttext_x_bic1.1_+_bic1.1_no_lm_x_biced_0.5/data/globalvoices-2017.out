although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and practi@@ sed his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was primarily a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less rep@@ orter who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ates by Julia Rober@@ ts as the law student who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court with judges who were inclined to his interest .
I was tra@@ pped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free according to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that is what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona was only exac@@ erb@@ ating my admi@@ ration for the US .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had written a very con@@ ten@@ tious love letter about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his opinion , he never holds behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague expressed it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless people have responded to his statements and voted in favor of him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can pres@@ election was the highest number reaching a candidate nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person ?
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply believing human being with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
Tr@@ umps Welt@@ anschau@@ ung did not agree with the current publisher of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , the current publisher of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix S@@ uns in the game .
m@@ umps In@@ tolerance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who struggl@@ ed for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Le@@ ak@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel@@ ors helped me much in my career .
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump sli@@ pped his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a halt and the counter@@ part of his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception to the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , gave the pres@@ idency a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the confron@@ tation with the idea that people voted for tr@@ umps because they shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ vot@@ ers as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , suggest@@ ing an in@@ ability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these vot@@ ers , of whom most know , voted for tr@@ umps because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , would they perhaps say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , it is hard to forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to raise a man looking at contemp@@ t for those who look different than he .
this &quot; white ash &quot; ( editor of the Ü ) : as much as &quot; White against all other ethnic groups &quot; ; word game from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the big Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has done so splen@@ did@@ ly .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have , America is welcome .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , there is a vast majority of the White Americas on this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later , he was corrected .
the country for which his son had fallen sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ ump &apos;s land , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children can &apos;t spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of Cat@@ ech@@ a ?
the fact that the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome poverty .
a music school with 100 students became central to the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs .
but this changed after a acci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ zz you learn day by day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , forest horn , ti@@ mp@@ ani , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from waste
more than 7.@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero the children of Cat@@ ech@@ a - a village located on the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays capital - are based on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ manufactured instruments made from local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ ech@@ a , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers led by F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments .
instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , contra@@ b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , saxophone , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and drums , all of which were made of tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra and so on .
in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local econom@@ ologist and musician of the children of Cat@@ ech@@ a , rec@@ alls :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in rub@@ b@@ ish The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
today there is an entire orchestra playing instruments from recycled material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic waste dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of waste each year .
those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - as the people in Cat@@ ech@@ a , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .

the orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © FISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content together .
in West Africa it was known back then that this ship had already operated in Liber@@ ian waters illegal fishing before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly raised and little inclined to welcome a legal break@@ er of that kind on its co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles swi@@ ft@@ ly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; rec@@ alls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan F@@ ish@@ eries Authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship at its time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was founded FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stop Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that the premi@@ er had exp@@ elled from their waters .
&quot; with this we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and mut@@ ually contribute to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Director of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers FISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , which is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing from regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ respect of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate equilibrium .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail boom , with the information between individual countries , the actions are now in real time , with track@@ able on FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that one not@@ ices or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas . also , such susp@@ icious driving routes can be discovered - such as that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such studies can show whether the participating ships have a catch @-@ catch license where they were on the road and possibly if they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information , meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pun@@ ishments , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is financially unable to pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consultant company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the previously mentioned platform was created to recover estimated $ 20 million in lost revenue that the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i lose every year due to illegal fishermen entering into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world .
among other things , such activities include sailing under false flag , fake licensing , speci@@ fying fantasy names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; they pur@@ pos@@ efully use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non @-@ fla@@ w@@ lessly organized control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; You dar@@ ed not run my port &apos; .
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close FISH @-@ i .
until now , the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , FISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected vessels .
it uncovered criminal networks that had spread bog@@ us licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found volati@@ le ships .
thanks to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crime , FISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our studies run quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that should help FISH @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that is constantly being developed helps to detect the illegal ships that would like to hide .
&quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to conc@@ eal their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tra@@ cking , a NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers technical support .
some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , for example , with which they can no longer be used by satellites .
this is why Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is designed to help FISH @-@ i find crimin@@ ally acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can FISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations have actually influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and Marine Organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by displaying the position of every single tracking ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to pool their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships which previously f@@ ished without licence and had hardly expected consequences , know now that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in FISH @-@ i have meanwhile reached a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since fishing boats are buying more licenses .
after the help of FISH @-@ i Somalia to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were there on board to@@ wing nets .
photo courtesy of FISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries are also notic@@ ing these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear yearly by illegal fishing .
in 2015 , six countries joined forces , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they now also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as FISH @-@ i@@ . â With safety the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently FISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member state Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph : in October it set Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the way under false flag . and not only was the ship on the way without licence and were used to@@ wing nets , which are now prohibited .
the ship was also inv@@ aded in prohibited waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for FISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collaborative working method for protecting the oceans truly works across the oceans .

the movements in Venezuela appear to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to halt the referendum on the inaugur@@ ation of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government rejected Venezuela &apos;s request for a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations about the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the recovery of Venezuela ) images of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central north @-@ north federal Parliament of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the federal state Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation deteri@@ or@@ ates continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by official authorities .
Marianne D@@ í@@ az , Contributors to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the rate of inflation is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together , urged the demonstr@@ ators to join a mass rally on 27 October and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an seat of government , on 3 November .
the call was ann@@ ot@@ ated on Twitter as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nation@@ wide civil war and on 3rd November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify to the overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared images shows a prot@@ ector calling through the protective signs : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

particularly large waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the government and armed supporters of the government , according to his own statement .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear a skir@@ ts , because otherwise you might see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic is already making the round , which forms the amount of suppression per day :
thus the dictatorship supp@@ resses the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an im@@ pe@@ achment procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .

others see these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from its point of view , has taken little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to mu@@ te critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was first published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news site .
the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Cór@@ doba .
as meanwhile adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano has now spoken against his father in the confin@@ es of the large La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cór@@ doba .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , investigated the crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept his family secret .
in the situation at that time I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ urer , and a mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano , was a civil servant . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence service division 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

however , this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor who was charged with ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who over the years realized the extent of atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and who testi@@ fied before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from sports hall to military base
when my father started taking me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I was friends with a boy who made combat sport .
they all called him K@@ ent .
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and called on me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you were friends with one of the ERP .
watch out that they will not kidn@@ ap you one day , and I &apos;ll have to save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military branch of Argentina &apos;s Revolutionary Workers Party .
that is why he prohibited me to return to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would be a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
at the base of the military , I had to destroy papers that had belonged to the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : University degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ Here the prisoners are tort@@ ured
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - everything was possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver .
that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were turned off and stopped me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are being tort@@ ured .
I sp@@ ed in and saw a couch where people were tort@@ ured .
she looked like a bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
they rarely tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and hun@@ ted him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there inside was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty wine .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible for a person to do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were band@@ aged and band@@ aged .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face - all were tied in hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people were sitting quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father re@@ marked that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me apart ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , and killed and buried by soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know this because my father spoke about it at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero collap@@ sed and killed a man there .
( according to survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was indic@@ ted by the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tort@@ ured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were tos@@ sed into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came from above that they should be laid .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen items .
at that time at age I had no idea what the &quot; war boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bay@@ onet or perhaps military badges that one takes on an enemy you have fought .

but if you go into a house and steal the fridge , the record player , clothes , painting , money ... that &apos;s not a war boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of security forces , could join in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have been able to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who steal a car on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded rage , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
my father was like that .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . both my father had from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought home clothes .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator of this crime . I replied , no problem , they can give me the burden of what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you can see the value of a life .
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so you executed people during the dictatorship of the dictatorship , but why would the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tort@@ ured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them in jail .
I guess it was just decided to kill these people . but why do their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families whom one could give to their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was re @-@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; my father said .
but of course something always remains .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie itself .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of indicating my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rep@@ elled and in@@ quired what all the exagger@@ ated patriot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian senti@@ ments &quot; they suppos@@ edly defended were good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you have committed horri@@ ble crimes and you as a child have forced me to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , please forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I issued the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I was bi@@ ased . I finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 at the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly serious cases , torture followed by death in five cases , and a case of ab@@ duction of a child under 10 years of age .

the jud@@ gements in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence in Spanish .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial concluded because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the court suspended imprisonment , and in nine cases , sentences ran@@ ged from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the original 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdi@@ ct : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ Stat@@ ster@@ ror@@ ismus
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling is a historic landmark for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who was founded in 1995 , representing the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but the research was 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government sur@@ rendered the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial site could be erected there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shield with the translation error in a Kyoto centre , in which one can extend its driver &apos;s license .
the photo was spread in the social media .
revision of the original Joshua Lev@@ ine photos .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving licence , last month witnesses of a very mis@@ erable translation .
on a sign the Japanese word &quot; Province &quot; ( kor@@ ei@@ ran sha ) , which means &quot; older car driver &quot; means fal@@ sely - but perhaps also with a malicious mind &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; horri@@ ble mot@@ orists . &quot;
the wrong translation was read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was shared in the social media many times .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n , which is published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it be such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incorrect English translation was first removed . the name &quot; terrible drivers &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , if gramm@@ atically not quite correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture have ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that older people felt off@@ ended by inadequate correction ( translation ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News started a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; has been den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly drivers involved in accidents across the country is a cause of concern .
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in the year 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors suffered 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors increased during the same period .
the rep@@ orter , named by name , brought comments to the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , showing the pre@@ judi@@ ces of some Japanese apparently against elderly drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation error was among other things the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; horri@@ ble mot@@ orists &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So defective is the translation actually not , right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills in order to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue , who could translate the translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ searching , or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , nevertheless make translation internally . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is rated as the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases caused by machine translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious im@@ prints that often ad@@ orn t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as a jewelry . but from large companies or from the government , which have the means to ensure higher standards , it is possible to expect more accurate translations .
in the future , the Kyoto city will hopefully use a rep@@ utable source for its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ or@@ ship measures on the internet and television
main page of the &quot; Nav@@ egar of Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online transm@@ it@@ ters also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups , resist@@ ing the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests started at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was sn@@ apped and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : enable your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are re @-@ locked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net website .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media has been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission on T@@ elecommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures , if they continued to report on the demonstrations because the Commission saw it as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
I signed up at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national TV channels .
it is surprising that this is still more favorable than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online channels . this also applies to the Internet site where the National Assembly we@@ aves its meetings .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server requests certain domains to be correctly answered .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds er@@ ron@@ eous or ref@@ uses to request such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third blocked channel , the transfer was dis@@ continued on Thursday 6th April when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was det@@ ained .
Fl@@ ores was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on air again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes Venezu@@ el@@ ans more difficult to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina fights for the rights of children and g@@ athers witness testimon@@ ies from other people who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report by Elec@@ tro , published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ produced by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house full of pride said about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ min@@ ta , one refers to Paraguay the more than 46,@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , more rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children must spend countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice , referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay as a result of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testimon@@ ies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , for the feeling of gratitude that cri@@ tically ino@@ cul@@ ates the Cri@@ min@@ as guarantees silence in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
there is , on the one hand , the family whom her daughter believes in the belief that she can complete her education , improve her position in society , and &quot; make something out of itself &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family who assi@@ mil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with faith is that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will only experience it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , has a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín arrived at the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent pun@@ ches . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was the household of Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who worked as a civil servant at the Ein@@ wohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 F@@ errei@@ ra beat Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela took responsibility for the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozens of people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely spread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the couple &apos;s neighbors and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a quick investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be indic@@ ative - if for the first time in the Paragu@@ ays story a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming to court .
the Daily Life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ mean tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to register bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
on Fri@@ days for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner she was done with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because it had to make supp@@ er for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she didn &apos;t have unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the househ@@ older than food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 .
some evenings forced the owner Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a to stand next to him and read editorial articles like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media on the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
he considered it intelligent , but did not stop with it . &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there again . so they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belonged to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would again speak their native Guar@@ an@@ í at home .
their Lord feared that they would lose again the education they had made possible for them .
but she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ anes to which Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to go home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , at the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I didn &apos;t belong to any group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share advertis@@ ements for cleaning staff and pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cians in Paraguay .

starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the country wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

bill introduces Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliamentary representatives recently voted in a bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ulations of use and benefits of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is accepted by the Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must be registered with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law a place would be set up , which is t@@ asked with allowing citizens to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months of adoption of the law , users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a sentence of up to six months imprisonment or a bu@@ ckle .
the bill , composed of six par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s and circul@@ ated in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and uses it to communicate with others through voice , video news and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the design does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration . un@@ clear is also how they should make up those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users of the telecommunications ministry received a user name and a password &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level on Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to file information about their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research T@@ echnolog@@ ist ( in German &quot; Senior Research Rep@@ eti@@ cian &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , that means they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who apply for a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Leg@@ is@@ l@@ ative Assembly and the Constitutional Com@@ mitt@@ ees before it comes to the plen@@ ary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in the parliament , in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ized and ensure that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the picture surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those who were found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kur@@ dish environ@@ ment@@ alist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ards in the war @-@ drawn Iraq

this contribution by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was published in the original at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions .
high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north east of Iraq , the animal rights activists H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq aim to protect the spirit @-@ like Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which fights through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ olor ) . in total there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they find less and less prey .
why is this particular le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big car@@ ni@@ v@@ ore exists .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild bo@@ ar is low and goes towards zero . as the team in the video states that they have a shot of a large cat in the camera trap , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passi@@ on@@ ately demonstrates a different side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs from Nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring that protected areas are set up for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for the northeast of Japan , documented the progress made over the last six years to re@@ build the life of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was an et@@ tish pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast which experienced both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the N@@ eigh@@ bor@@ hood Development Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to leave because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map .
for this reason , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture had an atomic accident , already alone 16@@ 0,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report by Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from local point of view the progress made six years afterwards to re@@ build the life of the local residents .
the detailed report of the paper contains both statistics of the Japanese Re@@ union Agency and the survey results of those concerned themselves .
residential construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that as far as December 2015 , 77 percent of the planned re@@ plac@@ ements are completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the greatest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures was achieved by Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms 70 per cent of the total light .
nevertheless , six years after the catastrophe , we still endeav@@ oured to reloc@@ ate evacu@@ ated accommodation to final replacement houses for six years after the catastrophe .
after the triple disaster , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated people who lived after the disaster in shel@@ ters were converted into final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma has res@@ um@@ ed only 30 percent of the fishing ports .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have largely affected ag@@ r@@ arian land in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agriculture .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 per cent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of farm@@ land used in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , are located in the nuclear pl@@ ywood zone .
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants feel it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population preparing for the next big earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated people .
in her introduction of the article , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed said that there was still not enough disaster prevention .
how it stands for those who had to evacu@@ ate from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue for the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
out of 16@@ 0,000 evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ations from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 6@@ 0,000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been reloc@@ ated to permanent replacement houses .
after 2017 , more than 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es most of the evacu@@ ated ones are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be bigger than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often sees that one connects more than it appears at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we address topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a migration has consolidated her aff@@ ection to the Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa writes about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

right : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva in a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week . last Friday , a police officer had killed him during a demonstration in G@@ oi@@ â@@ nia with a bat@@ on against his head . nation@@ wide millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of G@@ oi@@ ás has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and have now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures , the face of the police officer is also recogni@@ zable , who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of G@@ oi@@ ás declared that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the investigation of the incident .
the pictures show the police officer how he strikes in G@@ oi@@ â@@ nia with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the whole repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ al@@ ador , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from G@@ oi@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs rus@@ hed to him shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in social networks .
in the clip shown below , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10.000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in G@@ oi@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violent attacks against activists in G@@ oi@@ ás :
G@@ oi@@ ás is witn@@ essing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he was sabot@@ aged the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , we have been sabot@@ aged by a police force of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer who has struck him with a stroke .
police raid
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ oi@@ ás &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not the only country in Brazil where police brut@@ alities were brut@@ ally hostile to demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
polic@@ emen sat at protests in the center of Rio de Jan@@ eiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and peace party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest papers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media has sw@@ apped street protests by direc@@ ting the focus to another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window to illustrate their title pages illustr@@ ating their title pages .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a fire @-@ set bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a specific cause .
this must also be acknowledged if you are strictly opposed to any kind of damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are obsc@@ ured by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confron@@ tation with the police . &quot;
the villages forgotten by the indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ y@@ nos@@ o , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich Municip@@ ality , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ ag@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no significant crop of sugar on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories have been paraly@@ zed .
after dro@@ pping the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its plant until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding was left out of steel and concrete .
approximately 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ign and comm@@ ute every day to factories that are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who stands up every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are back in operation , because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene reminds you that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests aren &apos;t any news anymore .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality has already seen better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis in the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again over a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound must remain , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agri@@ cultural and Food Organisation .
if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , raw sugar exports would generate around $ 85 million for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years there was a shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; dec@@ eption . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first release year , the first letters began to come .
it was official documents , which were only distinguished by the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ room and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve every withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was taken over and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in use , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , awaits the retirement in another plant , which is Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped to build .

after two years Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to dism@@ iss it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ate the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without work in the region and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region at once .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve to supply the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .

first Nations people use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and to preserve their own culture
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo of a song by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Home to Me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do this by means of hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of traveling workshops .
since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres for youth groups to teach song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ ago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cre@@ e communities in North @-@ Quebec and then worked with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ Star .
the workshop en@@ vis@@ ages that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young@@ sters are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the territory of the tribe of the Kit@@ um@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also called Highway of T@@ ears , a road section in West kan@@ ah where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were mostly not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people were not always able to master the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young@@ sters were given some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of the North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop Group , who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is at his disposal , just as a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the day when you will hear our cry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because we as a youth have lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and also prec@@ ede our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator .
in the comment section , the reader and author of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( in the bu@@ zz@@ ing area of the island ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , close to the entrance Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; Plas@@ tische Models of the Cour@@ ts &quot; ) are issued by each dish served in this restaurant .
customers see these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a for more than 20 years .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them . however , a new trend is turning them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ tur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic rub@@ bers decorated mobile tapes as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial food were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collec@@ ti@@ bles , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ators mag@@ nets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was converted into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a handy stand .
this part was also part of the Tokyo station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the East .
some mobile phones and mobile @-@ designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case ik@@ ura and salmon roe are used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
is there someone who would say : &quot; w@@ ow , cool , now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon roe ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form , for example , to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands made of dried salmon .
other sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # bu@@ zz@@ ing , with flaws at the flaws found in the # # staff .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry , for example with the Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Ch@@ apo Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ning or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
there are behind every cor@@ pse , behind each bone @-@ find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico provides the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) which is intended to give these victims a voice and stories of people who were in the struggle between the law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organized crime not only lets us fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to travel many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the P@@ ain of Vic@@ tims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ e@@ ws in just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we are preparing again for the task that we have set ourselves to go and look for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 , he left the house .
on October 15th , he should be back , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not pay them out because they demand a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apr@@ és a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the governance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories from readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of animal pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve known illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with images that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only person who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues writing :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ cker ) if he is big . and it is not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified by being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ aving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not moving and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Capital District : how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; in this she describes how an armed criminals bar@@ ed money from their business for month , until they destroyed not only the business , but also tore up their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of this never passes away , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she conclu@@ des her report with the words :
we want others to be arrested , as one does not know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you .
in these fear@@ ful days I wonder@@ ed if tears would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation @-@ drawn generation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , roast potatoes , keep tor@@ tillas up and make &quot; ch@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells about the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years earlier when he was only a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez saw this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Government Council for Public Safety and the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the Prosec@@ ution counted 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mor@@ den per day .
these are just some hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has tort@@ ured the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand words un@@ true
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by the Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this article and the pages he links contain images on which violence is represented .
the check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but what is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
let us take this photograph of a horri@@ ble accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to depic@@ t trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tank truck passed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thereby devast@@ ated . roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tank truck fell victim to it .
representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a cinema close by , full of people watching the World Cup .
houses were scattered and cor@@ ed cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to be un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ably .
a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horri@@ ble scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies lined up on the floor while people watch them .
but history does not end here .
over the years the same photo was recorded several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o Go@@ won .
eye witnesses reported dras@@ tically the atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one left behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dism@@ ember@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated exempl@@ arily .
the occasion for the attack was also un@@ clear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , when it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of false attri@@ butions . Africa Check has documented assignments in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
another step further contributing personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely links the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection with arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly pur@@ suit of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning detection published by the United Nations , those who could flee could flee blows , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , fal@@ sely claiming that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an has said that monks and politicians have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to depic@@ t this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source had also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein being this statement , but had not associated the image from the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false stub@@ ble range back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
using an &quot; reverse image search &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders .
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , which are very similar to the mentioned image from DR Congo .
they come from a mixture of private sites , platforms of social media and common as well as national publications and are available in many different languages , such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded wrong reports , some have tried to un@@ mask the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have included examples of impro@@ per use and linked them to the respective countries based on which page they have been published . by this we want to portra@@ y the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been inter@@ connected ) , several examples may be used for mis@@ use .
here are some cases that can now be fully felt ( on the orange map ) :
map : News Fra@@ mes .
country examples of false cou@@ pl@@ uses of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ colored countries point to pages or servers that are still available for example for@@ geri@@ es or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the gray countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are probably also examples of fal@@ si@@ fication examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City addresses not only the fal@@ seh@@ ood , but also disc@@ usses the abuse of the picture from the DRC in connection with Nigeria , as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( DR Congo and beyond ) .

T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions according to the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am such as this one , which used the image from DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , have clearly seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who refu@@ te this .

even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was divided as evidence of the bom@@ bing of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ usive use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a twe@@ et that expresses sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are pursued , to del@@ aying , since the photos have been used impro@@ per@@ ly .

the Myanmar government issued a right to judge what it meant as &quot; inten@@ tionally f@@ ing@@ ered news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings in Myanmar . &quot;
this adjustment , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to outline that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein announced his 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and the image continues to contain it at the time of this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article of 2014 about students slaugh@@ tered by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am published by the Catholic near An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the picture does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar &quot; ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ se@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ ya@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo showed , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to gain greater attention to these events , presum@@ ably in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages related there@@ to were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message allegedly auth@@ ored by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums such as this one were translated into Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false report .
from the emb@@ assy in which the picture was taken from the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ tin mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos were dist@@ anced .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
Tin@@ Eye also points to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the map in gray ) but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and date / date stamp exist on the Web@@ cra@@ wler and sometimes they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared considerably after the disaster of 2010 , the picture ultimately bears a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in regard to greater discussions on the silence related to the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers cannot believe these images any longer .
with social media , there are dozens of people who are un@@ inten@@ tionally allowed to drink the water around a tragedy .
does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and does the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
one argument is that holding images of a refusal is equal to recogni@@ zing the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about for@@ ci@@ ble represent@@ ations in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about situations in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be replaced by context or completely impro@@ per style .
however , every study of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international it can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
these words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but everyone stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt at a simple translation .
a word or an expression does not suff@@ ice , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context is necessary in order to understand precisely what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for a whole period of time .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog , for example , you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - get tired of your parents in recognition of how they have been working for you in your younger years .
and words spoken in the H@@ uns@@ ric language spoken in parts of Brazil such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth one feels after getting war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Birds &apos;s own words about his blog about :
they dis@@ close other cultures , reveal other forms of thought and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site would like to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words while showing how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood of flood and land@@ slide in this decade .
caused by the mon@@ soon , normally used by the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu of O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country have stepped across the shore by heavy ra@@ ins .
according to a statement from the Sri Lanka cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly 100 people were missing because of the floods and mud@@ slides .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were transported to 304 safety places .
the ra@@ ins left on Saturday ( May 27 ) and the water levels in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the areas affected and still in@@ accessible .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka are providing regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the scale of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods ham@@ mer@@ ing the crisis of den@@ gue , Save the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water level of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force provided five aircraft for rescue operations , and another five are completed to transport emergency deliveries to the residents , which were floo@@ ded in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also announced their willingness to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood conditions and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry foods and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the ta@@ ir@@ u@@ f app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app to inform the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum .
last year after the catastrophe of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me has launched a &quot; flood relief &quot; key that allowed users to call a vehicle for assistance and donations . they were then for@@ warded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also launched an &quot; SOS &quot; key , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat ret@@ ali@@ ation campaigns for floo@@ ding and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civil population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , provide security and help residents in need .
this prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restor@@ ing norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and a lovely girl friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I trust in her four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children ; she is my rock in the surf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next , we transc@@ end rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbrellas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , others sk@@ an@@ tend slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , don &apos;t you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have been familiar with me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination .
they ab@@ duc@@ ted me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit there , are ab@@ duc@@ ted .
to be missed
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this has happened to the poet whose poetry is mostly sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you get into mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an , and the Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the western conception the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist paintings of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ integrated the history behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures are still prot@@ ru@@ ding today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to resist them .
I have been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how this powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous narrative domin@@ ates our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the past three decades , nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US has not even been able to vote for its first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ scarf in public buildings and Saudi Arabian , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exer@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and fla@@ wed that often Sik@@ h men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
a total of 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ ra@@ tives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims represent the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

back then , when Khan looked at the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were absolutely Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a must @-@ have Muslim and American woman ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - rather than pick up my Muslim recipes or my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief , which all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ est , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who try to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam hos@@ tility machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for false information that our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , there is an anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility to more than a stranger who breaks the head@@ scarf of a woman .

anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility in its ug@@ liest forms attacks our affili@@ ation .

I want to explain that .
I was born to Muslim but to be a Muslim only then was born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mos@@ que on the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : belief , behaviour and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girl@@ friend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ni@@ ghtly ritual with my daughter if I kept her in my arms and her Arab verse for shelter which seal the Qur &apos;@@ an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim belief is not always visible , but my Muslim nationality is always part of my shadow .

being Muslim means speaking the prayers that she told me when I had a bad day .
to be Muslim consists in the way she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation that has been colon@@ ized by a &quot; Empire &quot; for centuries , which a company founded with the name of Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dia Company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .

belonging to it is knowing that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who shared the Muslim world as at risk .
to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; all except four Muslim lands .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history has been dropped from a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mi@@ rian sub@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged story .
it means remember@@ ing that four@@ teen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent , apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate under veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy inv@@ ades the United States and the susp@@ ects bear a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that four@@ teen hundred years ago the first prayer group called Az@@ aan was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to that country .
it means calling Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded airports to fight against Muslim Ban . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple strings , but fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of 1.7 billion houses more possibilities than a cube of sor@@ cery , but it is represented in the reduced two &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people are building structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this two @-@ day basis .
structural anti @-@ Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim registry , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is made up of immigrants who take a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that sh@@ uts its borders to people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous No @-@ Fly list , which targets mostly Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs that we disc@@ ard on Muslim lands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .

the Con@@ vers@@ ations That We Have to Lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become too deep to be@@ g the Muslim or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous ima@@ gery that we put into our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global point of time we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not been given them yet ; now they are controlling large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who made me today an un@@ bound Muslim .
things I left behind in my speech like a bread crum@@ bling track .
things that perhaps wake memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k , where someone is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Ber@@ kel@@ ey , conversations take place during the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .

but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or that we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell that here at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people will be enth@@ ron@@ ed by the creativity of the &quot; other &quot; in the public imagination , four decades ago , he was the academic of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being consciously and un@@ consciously to consoli@@ date the &quot; other &quot; ; as my girl@@ friend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he already enc@@ ap@@ sul@@ ated countries and &quot; other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .

in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , there is a risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project , the following applies :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while listening is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate , to feel , to touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers can first and then translate their story into their own language and then explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story @-@ t@@ eller , their devot@@ ion and representation will lead to the fact that the audience lets themselves be informed .
they ev@@ oke laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this turn the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us tells the F@@ abel of the rab@@ bit and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the importance of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ us is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his feeling of inclusi@@ veness :
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
until now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can come into contact with T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling shows .
Puerto Rico claims a re @-@ establishment of state debt by the United States
with the aim of a revision of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 .
it was proclaimed by the Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da ( Ci@@ tiz@@ enship front for the ne@@ ural testing of the debts ) and the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical church meeting Puerto Rico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ establishment of the debt have also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for the debt will be held ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding re@@ mun@@ eration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconc@@ ile themselves with falling pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the territory of the United States - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
for this reason , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens , imposed measures will be in danger of being rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian Palestinian web developer , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture organised in Berlin , an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of Book Spr@@ ints , published excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective follow @-@ up ) .
the book , published last year and available here license @-@ free , contains a number of ess@@ ays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book aims to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what is the real cost to which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Colle@@ ctive Mem@@ ories gives his friends and his family a voice that pus@@ hes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , and immediately .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us beginning to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution .
his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 , she was contacted by persons who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his place of residence and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more predic@@ tive than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations , mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would put everything in place to wi@@ pe out this architecture , which is not only the cultural heritage of Sys@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be of in@@ estim@@ able value for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el has not yet completed this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire lifetime dre@@ aming of freedom and bass taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was det@@ ained .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other det@@ ain@@ ees to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a professional diary that she wrote to her husband during the years 2012 to 2015 when he was det@@ ained .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is licensed free of charge .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It Happ@@ ens &quot; :
it happens at every visit ,
that I will sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment that we embrace ,
that any of the dangers does not matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the crow@@ ding in the prison
and I insert into every detail of your voice and words
which I bear with my passion ,
when your eyes fail
and I let another piece of my soul leave with you ...
I return swi@@ ft@@ ly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all those moments ,
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...
G@@ haz@@ i wrote on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el :
one year passed , my soul
while doing so , during
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ le &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime in 2011 , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or subjected to violence by the regime were tort@@ ured or even executed .
since 2011 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custody since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we reiter@@ ate our call in the hope that we have to do so for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption sentenced Director after Haf@@ postpon@@ ement again on previous post
Moz@@ ambi@@ ans responded with anger to a corruption case in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence in which corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ end@@ ants of 54 million Me@@ tic@@ al ( about 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
in 2016 , Cam@@ ba@@ za was released for good management and immediately called for his return to the company , which happened on 19th April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which submitted the motion , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many residents do not mean the action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our judicial system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we take note of is that the company should also introduce a disciplinary action against the contra@@ cted one .
the company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ que social media , also decl@@ ines this attitude and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after having been sentenced to prison and half of whom served .
he could give paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inf@@ lict damage .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za likes to be paid for his silence .
contradi@@ ctory !
bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ que and student of political science in Brazil , says the director no mor@@ als :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state , because he ins@@ ul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that people are rewarded in such a way that the state has already so badly off@@ ended the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za l@@ acks the moral to return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served only himself in the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded in such a way .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , not only will the Moz@@ ambi@@ que be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a keen , inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaker .
one of his most famous verb@@ al represent@@ ations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man was capable of all , including the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also decl@@ ining :
sentenced to 22 years in prison , Cam@@ ba@@ za was imprisoned for 10 years and was released .
and today the company , in which he dis@@ likes money , puts it under contract again . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ 5.2 DOG ( @ az@@ zy _ Raf@@ ik ) 12th May 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored a lot of users
the bur@@ mes@@ an word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means ch@@ ick pe@@ as or spl@@ its .
photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ p@@ orted
according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network shared their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ors the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; the &quot; ( in bur@@ mes@@ an script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of the Hass@@ an language in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely degra@@ ding con@@ not@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of useful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts where they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed skep@@ ticism in order to express their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings , which have the same sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , stool on Bur@@ m@@ eric is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spi@@ der @-@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ keeper A@@ ung @-@ Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the pro@@ position ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ eric - is very similar to rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ats believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook has to be more analytical before it eradi@@ c@@ ates all the posts that are suspected of being rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( Chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( split pe@@ as ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech get a rather good lesson .
now it is time to cut off their nation@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who spread hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
social networking experiences in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ or@@ ship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks will simply begin to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned by the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was told the list@@ ings , posts and sharing of content for 24 hours because the mail &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their views against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author expressed his opinion of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the bur@@ mes@@ an internet community asking for advice :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen rac@@ ism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the dist@@ orted posts .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great turnover , that would be great .
fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ or@@ ship ensured a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech in order to see if their posts are taken from the network .
here you can see some scre@@ en@@ shots of Facebook posts that did not contain any hate speech , but were removed anyway :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ enshot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ enshot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should also inc@@ ite the violence in the communities of Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the prolifer@@ ous hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at contex@@ ts rather than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them .
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end of the day
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously adopted a law to ban this practice so that the sensible age is now at 18 .
in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , the representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not possess maturity . &quot;
despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contract partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors are defined as &quot; every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 there were 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical office of Central Statisti@@ cs confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married from 1997 to 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed at abol@@ ishing the laws of child marriage followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , , try to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point , doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft law .
but in early 2017 , the bill was decided against child marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law pro@@ claim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child marriage was approved in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
after having been approved in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws of the child were finally changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who suffers a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that has conce@@ aled the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the chil@@ dr@@ ens &apos; marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every prize .
while Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to complete the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas says : , , Excell@@ ent news !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been approved .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
follow Mut@@ a , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was :
the divor@@ ced age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years irrespective of the religious affili@@ ation .
the amend@@ ment to the marriage proposal was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 representatives in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties that were against have voted in favour of the law .
the chil@@ dr@@ ens are legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ testimon@@ agu@@ dab@@ use .
many thanks to all the activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible catch comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal action , the law should be passed , and he seems to rede@@ em his ple@@ dge .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished they would address the debate on the subject differently .

dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so univers@@ ally , in a way that only causes panic and disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure , if we , instead of talking about the problem that the state , our daughters against it , would be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are opposed to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where child marriage is legal or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

by mir@@ r@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can again view Wikipedia content
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , in contrast to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally .

for over a month now Turkey has blocked the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both students and rep@@ orters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ ade .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times also reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ or@@ ship from Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirror sites ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( calcul@@ ator computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is accessible however , in spite of the legal ban .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports on its efforts :
after we &apos;ve heard the messages ( about the locking of Wikipedia ) , we used it all to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . this way , there is the possibility to read the contents on a de@@ centralized and distributed manner .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only scre@@ en@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pe@@ .org , a mirror site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors if locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and staff at Moz@@ illa at Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
one attacks another URL , which is not the original . that which one sees then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server is direc@@ ting the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature protection
a refreshing rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned motifs and washed out colours .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to stra@@ igh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and his home town right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just returned home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the Leopard was , and I immediately started to kne@@ eling pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as fri@@ ghtening as they look .
and he should know it , for he stood face to face with Tig@@ ers :
a tiger can &apos;t be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the King of the bush appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at us and he star@@ es at me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une nature and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living close to tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos below .

years after the wedding , it was the first time Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organisation from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid speaking with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women give that they respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , maintain this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was con@@ vic@@ ted by the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a bog@@ us court and exp@@ elled from her family and village community after having addressed a married relative with name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also is not common among men . however , they have far fewer re@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of the 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the Camp@@ aig@@ n # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates the exploitation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
she has been working with her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as the Children &apos;s Council until the exile of HIV and AIDS infected , and guides these clubs .
it reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was about women who did not name their hus@@ bands on behalf .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
saying that the names of their hus@@ bands do not speak lou@@ dly , is a custom that they have all con@@ vic@@ ted and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not observe this is regarded as a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini relates :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him on his name from now on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , aff@@ ection@@ ate and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does this mean that they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women should never pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini relates :
a woman was so shy that she was ch@@ u@@ ck@@ led during the whole exercise ; another decided to release all the fru@@ stration of him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the adren@@ alin rush of having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands on behalf .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed at her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started out in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead that shows the sp@@ ell@@ atus :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would carry the In@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for many women , the club &apos;s club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; we make a trip every discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives . they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never imagined before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say things loud , no matter how small they are .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothes .
some women in the group have only wore sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them this is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ist @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , wearing ; they didn &apos;t dar@@ ed .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the mer@@ its of one &apos;s own choice of clothes , the mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini were sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed their own pairs of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion group so that the women could carry them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are getting rolling slowly :
so far we have made only small steps .
some women rehear@@ sed it a few times but then stopped telling the name of their husband .
some , including myself , are still doing it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes that they wish to achieve in their lives - like fil@@ ing for more freedom of movement or their own coat @-@ of @-@ arms - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I &apos;m it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and reports to other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative tag
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
scre@@ enshot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29th of this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag JE@@ ANS has been the highlight of the Day ( Beat@@ les @-@ Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce Day ) in the Japanese Twitter @-@ Trend , where many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war era .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noted in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here quite quickly realized that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good morning ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today is the Beat@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Day of Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at jap@@ an@@ ese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places related to the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you love the Beat@@ les , these are the 5 places you absolutely need to visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be whi@@ m@@ si@@ r@@ ile enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year as well .
and of course , some companies also use the fan base market @-@ specific , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could this be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will now listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ esterday &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day is going to run .
so , we hope you are there !

bald men are dep@@ orted and killed in Moz@@ ambi@@ que
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the population that men of light could be in Moz@@ ambi@@ que target of attacks .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of members for organ traffi@@ cking , presum@@ ably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , distur@@ bs the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government has now called a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are being used .
there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia said to the BBC .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that in 2016 the UN conducted a mission in the South African country to examine this practice .
the persecution of people with alco@@ hol@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and pre@@ ju@@ dice .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que , men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que are the target of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ que police after the latest mur@@ ders of three men @-@ headed men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que said that the local police already did the case :
PR@@ M believes the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for presum@@ ably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims had power in the head power , the wealth gen@@ eri@@ ve .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared the chron@@ icle of the blog gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambi@@ que :
I M@@ NE@@ s A MO@@ ST , THE SI@@ CH is ashamed A country in which people would have shame to go to the streets and would not hurt others or even take their lives to earn their bread , a land in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald men would be hun@@ ted for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; that aim to get too quick wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambi@@ que and avi@@ d Twitter users , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal , Pedro S@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ que authorities are very worried about the assass@@ inations of bald people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are deeply affected to experience the death of our friend Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our heart@@ felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , friends and all those who have known him and loved him .
a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , active in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our Arab blo@@ gger meeting in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who were themselves the insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death but did not give any further information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bas@@ tian &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a learned about the fact that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we honor the creation of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we honor the efforts of all the people and organizations that have been deployed in the last five years for his release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , thus the organization of the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested or for@@ ci@@ ble by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 there were no fewer than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in custody , so the international human rights organization Am@@ ne@@ sty International .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state risk ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case &quot; an internal matter . &quot; a spokes@@ man tells him that he considers it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China still receives calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or permit him to be treated abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ med up some reactions abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Affairs of B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were continued in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the salmon exports to China , since exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ u as she said in a statement on 30 June :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad informed that the Americans &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treating abroad , in so far as he can help him in his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US emb@@ assy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the AF@@ P news agency on 27 June that the emb@@ assy ur@@ ges Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
the US emb@@ assy demanded an angry response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley commented that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical treatment of his choice based on the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condi@@ tionally so that he can go into a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany , Germany
German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hope that Li@@ u will get all the medical support he needs , &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
previously diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had big concerns about whether the vort@@ ex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide a suitable medical care to Li@@ u and give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family .
Li@@ u An@@ walt told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and allow for the exercise of these rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
France , France
France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all the treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information out whether France will ultimately receive it .
Taiwan , Taiwan
the Council of Land Affairs in Taiwan promp@@ ted China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Party of Congo also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself in a statement on 28 June in Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem foolish , since Singapore is recognised internationally as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered as a city .
this re@@ mark has spar@@ ked a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister re@@ marked that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries .
it supports Singapore to be considered as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercising of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this precious land , we can say that we are not a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , it inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the point of the theme , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ it@@ arian rulers , who preten@@ ded to be demo@@ crats , will leave the rot@@ ated logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end , the responses to his American guests in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were really non @-@ responses to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system .
he fl@@ ared up relevant questions with non @-@ responses ra@@ tionally .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his mind as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to elu@@ ci@@ date this point as long as he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points to the critic@@ isms that one should begin reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections .
he compared Singapore to cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , the leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another matter .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it , and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ integ@@ rates the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; commit a mistake &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian advoc@@ ate ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of the city go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of grave importance .
why do the people of Singapur do their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
who needs to pay back our Prime Minister ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade tends to move to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence appears to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defending the country in particular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should talk more of defending the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , which reveals rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most asked for me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan .
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly against anger when they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t b@@ other me .
for someone who does not know himself , there is little that separates us from Americans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans attach a Canadian flag visi@@ bly to their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we evi@@ dently say very often &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country in relation to ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if I would like to conf@@ use me with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first : to be called &quot; nice &quot; means to be sp@@ oo@@ ky - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian dou@@ bler ) .
if Canada were really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means being in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not earning any attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a chief feature of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool hum@@ ility .
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with their neighbours .
we lack the warm , open kindness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau took the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ ls Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one of Thailand &apos;s famous pop band released a music video that ero@@ des the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continue to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band and colour describes a young man who tells him what prec@@ ep@@ ts his girl@@ friend makes .
although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was vo@@ wed by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video up@@ loaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 254 times divided and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially how it beha@@ ves with the country &apos;s position under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos of the video , which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has followed in recent three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the pro@@ visional constitution , which provides absolute decision making over important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; change in settings &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered as critics of Jun@@ ta .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army to monitor and prosec@@ ute the online content and to prosec@@ ute those who accused the monarchy .
Thailand op@@ ts for &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ estic &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ins@@ ult ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was declared in Thailand .
two days later , the army came to a coup .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although safety experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
the video even shows how people are thrown into a black van before placing them in an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile , the teas@@ er of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of ghost towns in Eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society only recovered very slowly in East @-@ East @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has been over 20 years since the Georgi@@ an @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern part of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ ae@@ ava are located in the coal @-@ basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Eur@@ asia , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the Soviet era .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today mostly Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ asen are living in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these spiritual cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the area amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after it had barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 , around 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early six@@ ties , called Khr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ ch@@ kov@@ ka , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and very rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ?
it is nevertheless un@@ equi@@ vocal . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Khr@@ us@@ h@@ che@@ ka kas , which are still one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me in the hand with the camera , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother banned us from taking photos , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply prohibited us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( farming of agricultural products for personal use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable farming .
it &apos;s difficult to talk about the rounds .
in the winter , the District Administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago an older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she says .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with pill@@ aging .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day that the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation ended , a little boy rus@@ hes past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball rolling .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the ru@@ ined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which will ensure infin@@ ity in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it otherwise .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way to the migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als pink frame and gold coloured ear rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez nar@@ rates , people come to full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
currently it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outdoors on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are ill , they buy them drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it fits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans are often travelling together and that the Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , it began its journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months . he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he replies sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez nar@@ rates that her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana .
wife Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but it is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he started helping them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
currently there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on blank@@ ets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking station outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela states that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and do not help others . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children before people who wanted to ext@@ ort money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single person , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step should be .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses , the travelers consult their phones quietly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone .
like a proud grand@@ mother she leaves with many photos in her album .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she briefly introduces her to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their phones .
on 10 July , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of Ur@@ um@@ qi issued a cell phone notification in which it noti@@ fies the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing it from access@@ ing terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because , shortly after they had installed the app , they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police informed that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and remotely control their own home network .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this app with the filters for min@@ ors is meant to help children develop a healthy lifestyle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , an app with these functions can be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while reporting on digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China most often focus on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south , reality is often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the areas of conflict , the authorities often prescri@@ be extreme cens@@ or@@ ship and surveillance measures , as well as routine Internet shut@@ down@@ s .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( the Direc@@ torate of the Direc@@ torate of Printing Newspapers , published in China ) showed photos of a check@@ point where police checked the residents indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification asked people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected by a check@@ point with a device without this software , you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for elderly people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest @-@ technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( by the local section ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s installation , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the orders of the city party council to minimize the spread of illegal content .
all governmental branches , authorities and affiliated institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane portra@@ ys his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is important .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able from both inside and outside .
one that ren@@ ders honour to their name .
one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when reality rec@@ alls you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the scenes , the beautiful scenes and the actors , the characters transform themselves out of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubts dissolve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of the un@@ cle . it becomes clear to you that you are tra@@ pped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
during a peaceful protest , five young@@ sters were pulled out of the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was sufficient for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all quarters were cov@@ eted , my own not .
for the first time , it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
I interrupted the silence by sh@@ outing &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof several times .
I heard my voice re@@ fut@@ ed by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined a magnificent picture that filled my expectations completely and completely .
in such a moment , you are aware that you release the spirit from the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the Military Security Building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the Security Service office .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts speaking : &quot; let me hear how you scre@@ am &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you &apos;re only brave enough to cry when we &apos;re not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hadn &apos;t thought that you had forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not regret a word of what I have said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father right away with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to that . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this accur@@ sed sentence is in my nose to this day .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture , which I was subjected to months .
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a cor@@ ridor to the individual cells .
I im@@ print all the details before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably have allocated a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner and I must put it right away without waiting for permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell , and I went back to an old @-@ tried communication method : beating the f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ aid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally replied to me .
apparently there was in none of the surrounding cells a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the Doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no striking faces can be seen on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the great cells .
perhaps he will be inter@@ rog@@ ated immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive away all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ elled on the fruit in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es sound , every day .
the door opens .
I have always been convinced that black is the colour of corruption until I saw the yellow light that gave us the horror of a person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : in order to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dial@@ ect - thus they played their sec@@ t@@ arian black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view .
this is not a home here that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminal of their cl@@ an into a hero .
I enter the inter@@ rog@@ ation room and meet Abu ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he appears to me like that .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join those days and protest against demonstrations that will soon end up . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I can &apos;t say exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool after a kind conversation .
when and how that happened was not important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to getting used to being punished if I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
in penalty in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the loving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confes@@ sion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , probably from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure yourself with him and you can &apos;t hold back your scre@@ am .
my cri@@ es were not yet enough , which is why they exchanged the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a collector or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed four cables to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them alternate , while I was still at the row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t take any pleasure in making it next to an electri@@ cally loaded rod .
power flo@@ wed through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body , stretched out on the floor , was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I decided to go to sleep again , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some hours passed , which came to me just like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light meets the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mit dir , as@@ sh@@ fu@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of a exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and go away , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always had let me go .
where do they guide me ? !
Jord@@ anian R@@ apper E@@ ms@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
E@@ ms@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
E@@ ms@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he slo@@ ws down to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and back to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his ch@@ apped lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and had forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ lows ( such as : farmers ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their tried @-@ and @-@ tested opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed music .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as ori@@ ental alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these themes are not only relevant in his home town of Am@@ man , but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as a person who is not limited by limits in his mind , and can feel with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special relu@@ ct@@ ance against US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation &quot; - this is what he calls himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so , because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; while he poured into water dissolved Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a sen@@ ile hot boy &apos;s day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the pieces speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the s@@ wa@@ ths of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when looking at the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an - to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert announcement .
MP and former media spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just &quot; was canc@@ eled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous ac@@ tivis@@ m , which questioned the established legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to choose &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement might not be simply shallow rh@@ et@@ oric , but in fact reflect a more and more cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b moved traditional gender norms to Lei@@ be by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
in recent years Jordan has increased the number of &apos; Ehren@@ mor@@ se &apos; - the in@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ orary mor@@ ays reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence .
according to a law to fight against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of inner @-@ family violence can &quot; be kept in prison for an in@@ definite period of time , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures as well as the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary for the wife to do nothing .
even H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well known for not shy away from topics that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , full of explicit reference to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in@@ scri@@ bed in politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of the Palestinian identity .
in Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , one verse often repe@@ ats :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where , in his words , you can &quot; get what you want &quot; - whether it is faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gen@@ ei@@ ty or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bians and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya in order to find out later that his comments were torn , twi@@ sted and cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was only a edited version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ evo , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ die , who was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can &apos;t Jordan do it ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
there is nothing new in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian realm that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service notes several former members of the government and members of the teachers &quot; association , argu@@ ing that they have cri@@ tically expressed themselves on the issues raised in the country with the corruption that was deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has prevented M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the aid of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , street uni@@ tions and on artificial ways . at least he hopes that .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ rior doll@@ s are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one assumes that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in many parts of To@@ ho@@ cus in August . another theory states that the trucks , drums and dancing came over more than a thousand years and from a time when armies from the west of Japan mar@@ ched into the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab a couple of great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a Community Center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two trucks are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true one - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ meter high carriage was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

outer appearances and body care have rarely been as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate profession like those of the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are common@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ y@@ mar ( Brazil ) have led to getting more and more normal citizens into the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can reproduce these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the ou@@ ter@@ most limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
experts compete against each other in order to show who can create the most ex@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile of Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hair@@ dres@@ sers and to receive training in hair@@ dressing , which enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
prior to the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because from love to the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the &quot; love message on gu@@ er@@ illa fighters , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important to accommodate people who feel upset ?
this is precisely the question of the young Colum@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the FAR@@ C gu@@ err@@ illa movement , which forms the end point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the sig@@ nat@@ ory of the treaty was considered to be so important that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
however , in front of Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ oric and carried out their weapons around the clock , must now be integrated into life as civilians .
in turn , Colom@@ bian society , accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take up in its ranks and support it in setting up a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ er@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society .
the target of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ er@@ illa fighter , which is to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconc@@ ile arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response .
thus the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for ex @-@ fighters of the FAR@@ C who now find their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; she says .
until now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i would never have thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the FAR@@ C members acted as they had previously done in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive commands , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
&quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything in between , &quot; said the student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go into because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ werfer , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Palace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life has someone written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him , and sat down beside the gar@@ der@@ men .
perhaps he was also tired of the war , I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as a war . to join the FAR@@ C was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside that awaits us with open arms .
so far I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
at the start , students and some leaders of the FAR@@ C joined a discussion group .
the students were all grown up when there was war and the FAR@@ C already acted in secret .
that is why FAR@@ C leaders declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state looked upon the entire Colum@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard before and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people whom I often had seen as monsters and even hate , were only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the camp commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bians were informed that peace would reign after dis@@ arm@@ ament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take up arms , lift themselves up and protest for their rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the FAR@@ C are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will im@@ pe@@ de many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

this is followed by a translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ ova and whose first publication took place on the website of OC Media .
homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed by the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community does not rise until night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports were published to address the dra@@ gging , torture and kill@@ ings of qu@@ eer men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , det@@ ained susp@@ icious qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a tran@@ script , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
from her childhood she felt she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender balance of their country@@ woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
out of fear for her life she moved to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans @-@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you shame ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right wing of the lungs .
OC Media : in which hospitals were you placed - in the men or women of the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out of date , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they set absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex , that all was just bad talk , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster that has damaged not only your family but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she laid a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window , a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it stood under the window .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was prosec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I bought her without regi@@ stering me , without identification , without anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
came and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;d be safe , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you are in . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : just with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o theme .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I actually try to look at the person she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed behind ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to someone who had been in ar@@ gun for one and a half months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he told us that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an there were no people arrested and tort@@ ured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably invite relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are not so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to ask Cad@@ y@@ rov &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented later as terrorists .
say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or a military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people had not simply disappeared , they were deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cally change themselves .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard has grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken along .
however , until now they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports yet . we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else wouldn &apos;t you have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a bo@@ b .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Gros@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to introduce us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but eventually thrown us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had dy@@ ed eyel@@ ashes , wore tu@@ b@@ ular je@@ ans and short tops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Security Ministry of Sh@@ aria has never com@@ promised me a hair too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : Khar@@ ki@@ ah Khar@@ da . that means : &quot; don &apos;t think about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just shut their eyes off you because they believed they were ill ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never ins@@ ul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never struck me .
OC Media : how long did this grace period stop ?
Sab@@ rina : so long before Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality in television .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless - one could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at once looked at you with suspicion .
in that time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic ever deteri@@ or@@ ated .
OC Media : what &apos;s your favorite activity now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 Dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist .
currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I esc@@ ort them to the hospital and help them get food tickets .
I do not spend a p@@ enny for it .
I have discovered these people themselves when I cli@@ cked off breeding places .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you carry a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ bern .
this is the nature that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to make you white with foam before the mouth that there are no g@@ ays in them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have what the cab@@ ard@@ ines have , the Russians also have ; on the whole planet they exist - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear what to hear .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practi@@ sing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ ad@@ an - live together with men .
you know , many think about transi@@ ence to men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different life settings .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I &apos;m myself now .
local groups warn against an increase in su@@ ici@@ des within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ val@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , in the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness to be able to create in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who wish to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ val@@ z .
a video shared on YouTube took the moments after he had lighted himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month was hanging out several others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless because of the persecution of the Iranian government , unable to feed their families and pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi are suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a deep economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to cont@@ em@@ plate their living .
a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took over power and made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most abundant and most valuable useful areas for Iranian farming .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets less of this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically ref@@ uses the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs to create jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are surrounded .
these dam@@ s have only been used to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ k youth has now risen to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , announced that 5 % of Ah@@ val@@ z@@ is who had a job completed primary school , 55 % finished secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ i , an Iranian gene@@ alog@@ ist human rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging from Ah@@ val@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions do not pre@@ tend to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is depri@@ ved of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their pro@@ s and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi , as even Arab names in the workplace may not be toler@@ ated , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists beat the alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world w@@ akes up and takes notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoi@@ dable .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put out well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should be all femin@@ ists inside .
for example , women today still earn less money than men , despite the same education .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and fai@@ ths .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced that I am double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to talk about skin colour , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention the way we have always been ab@@ used physically , psych@@ ologically and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists decide to remain silent .
but are all agreed that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift their voices &quot; and &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &quot; to sing &quot; in order to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alised form of ra@@ cially motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women from other ethnic groups and places of origin deserve less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background will be referred to the school more often than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background face a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership as white women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join me as a black woman in whose center the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to consider injustice in her thinking , which relate both to sex and to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
so@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is historically an ab@@ usive and margin@@ alized being .
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to close white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin colour and gender . for some of them continue to keep silent the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and join me in the movement of wom@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman instead of campaig@@ ning for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so ob@@ st@@ inate that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever for us to define black women according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres that are created by us for ourselves .
cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana v@@ asi : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ( about : Africa @-@ Wom@@ an@@ ism : how we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and where the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call for separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement that the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I am recognized as part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and , as a result of my being , as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life has neither passed nor ignored nor rejected .
pad@@ dle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water routes in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ med up the ur@@ gency and importance of his work on a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work is on persec@@ uted , little @-@ respected sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques , with the help of op@@ pres@@ sive communities to tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays Women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Ag@@ ainst Women in Paraguay &quot; by Elec@@ tional . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a police commission@@ er said that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her spouse , who had become violent against her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman was shown Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of abuse , the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez indication was of no use .
a few days later the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
when women give advertisement at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must at all be reported to the law enforcement agencies .
inhal@@ ts@@ 1 beats and Statisti@@ ken@@ 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that does not under@@ cut Paragu@@ ays La@@ ws : good approach , inadequate implementation impacts and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay &quot; she explains .
the available numbers , however , are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 people attended the District At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office for domestic violence . 70 % of them were about violence against women .
86 % of the police were reported by women .
there were more than 5000 advertis@@ ements due to domestic violence among the peace courts . here , too , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came .
in the adver@@ ts 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on any woman who will report in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on any woman who ref@@ uses advertisement for physical abuse , two women who do not do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not an own crime , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , all ten days a woman died in Paraguay because of violent acts by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she did . this should rep@@ ent her forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos . but for two years she inherited the psychological violence in his turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recogni@@ zable :
I would never have thought that I would once become a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happens to women who are too sub@@ missive , because they let themselves be fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two years relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen for so long from Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it almost seemed as though they wanted to say that victims of abuse would at least have some complic@@ ity .
Victoria Santos , who is not from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years in order to prove that her former partner mi@@ stre@@ ated her .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse in some way .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psychological abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s adver@@ ts with the authorities remained without result and also from her relatives , she received no support .
she conducted a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ predictable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ays La@@ ws : good approach , fla@@ wed implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a road full of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # für@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non natives ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law en@@ vis@@ ages to declare Fem@@ ali@@ d on an independent criminal off@@ ence and to pun@@ ish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the text was changed in a number of points in order to also gain Members of the Law who feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be lev@@ elled , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill fores@@ ees most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which the victims of violence need to carry on themselves if they just want to submit an ad and want to get a safe place to place the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
a re@@ thinking must take place here , so that violence is not seen as a normal thing .
anyone who is silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
we must reimbur@@ se for such a long time until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been changed , among other things a passage that the partners had called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions about the changes are going apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a major set@@ back .
this article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The Viol@@ ence Ag@@ ainst Women in Paraguay &quot; by Elec@@ tional . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
independent media in Oman one year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution of the Minister of Information , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is read on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Egyptian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its reporting on corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served a year @-@ old sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later released again .
Oman has been reig@@ ning since 1970 by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after leaving his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state empire .
since then , in addition to its role as a single sult@@ an , the chief offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , supreme commander of the armed forces , finance ministers , foreign ministers , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , particularly domestic secret services , public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , restri@@ cting and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in public authorities and institutions online and offline .
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n , their closing and imprisonment three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of justice . &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Board of Directors , was invited by ISS to the special department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS received the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as chief editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest .
the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the paper on any way , including online , is prohibited from August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the trial in Mus@@ at .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned , among other things , for distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , abuse of the Internet , and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of viol@@ ating a ban on publication and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( US $ 7@@ 800 ) . in addition , a one @-@ year ban on professional ban was imposed on both journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order .
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13,@@ 000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the App@@ eals Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following a six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mask@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j remained in prison , where he served his imprisonment .
the App@@ eals Court also called on the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to res@@ ume , the newspaper is still exposed to attacks by the Government of the Republic .
on January 8 , the Minister of Information issued an order , with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information received another order in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of App@@ eal to re@@ equi@@ p the publication of the newspaper .
the continuing shut@@ down of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press has been viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
other violations include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atine and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set up its operation .
due to the continuing shut@@ down of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to extensive violations of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the authorities to :
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2 . creating a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n in order for their journalists to pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists can exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including legal har@@ ass@@ ment .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need on @-@ site medical research : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines absent from the global health care system , which cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more severe impact in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post @-@ doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself studied at the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ á@@ bian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the S@@ á@@ bian National Programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I &apos;m just starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
FAQ : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always be recipi@@ ents instead of being a creator .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries .
FAQ : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
FAQ : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic education , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
FAQ : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa from western countries based on your experience ?
RW : it is often the limited speed of things to do , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges .
the system that magazines can only make articles available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about possible solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ mm , the first plant grown and consumed by NA@@ SA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work has been limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue using them for breeding .
the patents are not only applied to individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or card types . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition Mort@@ on still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but it takes longer because his work is still more difficult due to more and more limitations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if there is a bou@@ lder in a river that I have to share . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents on salads go too far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand trial , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot; so he continues as well as possible and tries to breed those features he wants .
however , he is very careful , however , and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement growing steadily in the US and throughout the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( open source breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have cul@@ tured and eaten red ro@@ mer@@ let@@ tu@@ ce of the Out@@ red@@ mm variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station , where it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather like the movement origin@@ ates from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative für &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be used permanently for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US bre@@ eders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders simply allow others who purchase their seeds , breed it to breed their own varieties , and do not make it straight away - two aspects that are prohibited or required by many plant patents .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
dar@@ ker views
for the em@@ eri@@ zed professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ SS@@ I board member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants are both important for food security and environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in larger gather@@ ings like biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the open @-@ source movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , corn , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seeds , &quot; he says , and takes part in the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agri@@ business industry , the latest examples are the amal@@ gam@@ ation of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to allowing others to remain freely available to others . in contrast , their approach is in contrast to patented seeds and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material that is thus becoming increasingly available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ SS@@ I , has engaged in his doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all card features are protected as intellectual property , making it possible for plant bre@@ eders either not at all or only complic@@ at@@ edly .
there are no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that large @-@ scale plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are grown in such a way that they have specific desirable characteristics - from those by which their taste or colour improves to such , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders goes through more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since changing conditions through climate change are much worse predi@@ cam@@ ent .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowle@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving the genetic diversity .
it contradi@@ cts , however , that intellectual property eng@@ ages other bre@@ eders because &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has ex@@ pi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing the public with more material and know @-@ how . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : wait 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly not fo@@ sters innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the battle already .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders neither have the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want to make farmers their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we can &apos;t continue using the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eders , we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety breeds his own values in them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation it requires a large scale of her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the stal@@ em@@ ate or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on looks for salads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on also believes that bre@@ eders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than a company that is patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalog , because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties themselves in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you are protected from competition for 20 years , making it quite easy in my opinion . &quot; worldwide response
although the US seems to be leading in the open source , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program .
it also helps them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Organization Agreement is working on an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ SS@@ I &apos;s commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ SS@@ I obligation is not simply one to be taken over in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive committee of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally cultivated plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now up to the governments of the Member States to apply the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives from governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for seed research .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for open @-@ source seed seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open source seed seed systems for which the official launch should be scheduled for the next year .
a combination of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a seed and biodiversity database to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - has published a joint network of aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also empha@@ sizes the importance of a diverse local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a link that Lu@@ by von O@@ SS@@ I hopes to see more people soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has largely paid attention to where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet .
this time the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist met .
on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about them .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities sharply critic@@ ised this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic network for Human Rights information remains , in spite of this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law of defending the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , leaving in this part of the world and giving victims a voice .
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cens@@ ored site of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of web site closures . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in the Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ t@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no longer access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of columns and articles which he writes for in@@ accessible websites and media in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the blog he set up to b@@ ypass the Egyptian government &apos;s cens@@ or@@ ship is the goal of an attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blo@@ gger who is home to Canada &apos;s blog , on the other hand , is still accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting about the student protests and taking a video on how the police practi@@ sed physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself to the locking by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the block of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey me the feeling of a state of si@@ ege , arrest , attempted murder , un@@ loading at national security council , blocking blo@@ gs , and any other web page I was working for .
2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ or@@ ship .
but now , after blocking it and that they &apos;re afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of vendors by transferring Internet cens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the block of web pages that V@@ PN@@ s offer began .
such practices indicate the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to .
the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ or@@ ship decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government willing to go out with cens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Jan@@ eiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day after day , newspapers in Brazil are reporting with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Jan@@ eiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Jan@@ eiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves harsh pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , navy and air w@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tight financial situation , the 2017 non@@ violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become common@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published on 16 August published the editorial &quot; That is not normal , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new column called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes happening in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . everything that happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes said that this decision was not a cause of pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for In@@ ner Security , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes on :
we are aware that a war discourse when it is dist@@ orted can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; har@@ ms more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oliv@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence is a &quot; war . &quot; this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent neg@@ lect of public service .
reminder : the Federal State of Rio de Jan@@ eiro is larger than its capital .

to call Rio de Jan@@ eiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per federal state , Rio is at No. 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , has been empha@@ si@@ zing that , as Cec@@ í@@ lia stresses , the state &apos;s security policy has been repe@@ ating for years .
the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , was also part of these security policy measures .
in the beginning , however , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also causes serious consequences for people .
for this calls on the state to use means and ways that are typical of war . this includes inv@@ ading into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; mis@@ led bul@@ lets . &quot;
war on or off , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
it is now a week that the police climbed the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

in order to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
scre@@ enshot from the Advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ ck
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer brutal war@@ fare and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X peace organisation and the Syria Institute &apos;s research institute , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib are currently in a state of si@@ ege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib .
the East G@@ hou@@ ta region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition proceed on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under si@@ ege outside Damascus , which led to the need for local residents to depend on locally produced food or through tunnels and control points .
through years of block@@ age , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the traditional dishes planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . their food , however , makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the Direc@@ torate of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years now has been struggling to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more &quot; fame . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting fung@@ i , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 4th September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % .
due to the shortage of fuel , locally produced fuel is used from plastic to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Production of mushroom seeds origin@@ ating from regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have spread mushrooms throughout east G@@ hou@@ ta free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking of si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new source of food on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ due ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc . ) for gaining new food .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and si@@ ege will become apparent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis regions and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ra@@ mp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days called a State shower .
fires were also recorded in the region of Gal@@ ic@@ ia in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 explo@@ sions that spread to the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June there was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite ima@@ gery , some 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon area .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in four districts .
all of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017

numerous videos are spread on the web and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the predictable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to limit the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open streets surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy like in June could have happened , as the roads were locked very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had brought to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was objec@@ tion@@ able by the local authorities , who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced e@@ asing of the law , which permitted the construction activity of case , if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; adds Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article of the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the Qu@@ erc@@ us environmental organisation draws attention to the fact that large areas of eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , are spreading , as in a vi@@ cious circle , to fires of this kind .
these problems add to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when inhabitants were looking for information or trying to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they took advantage of their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire brig@@ ade and became so crucial at this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers didn &apos;t stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who persec@@ uted the fires : the site counted more than half a million hits .

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the T@@ ali@@ ban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups , who had defeated the short lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belonged to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy was to break up .
his un@@ cle would pick it up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the T@@ ali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt protected .
the T@@ ali@@ ban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his flight , A@@ shar@@ f found herself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was difficult and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little wage , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and tra@@ iled s@@ acks with mort@@ ars that were he@@ avier than he himself to earn his li@@ veli@@ hood .
back then , like today , the lives of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran have been shaped by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ k rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , on which we also worked .
there were no services and no heating there . we covered nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greece .
after the Greek authorities rejected his request for asylum , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 .
for some time , A@@ shar@@ k was hom@@ eless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to people in need twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high ratings . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organization Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre , if they have officially submitted a request for asylum - which is still possible after the registration of the asylum application for months .
until then , people who do not have money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ f .
but his innocent li@@ veli@@ hood helped A@@ shar@@ k to get rid of these conditions .
after spending several years in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and fast food fast food .
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the companies operated by Afgh@@ ans have sprung up , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Express , in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp in Pad@@ ua . Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na pizz@@ eria in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals , however , extend far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade and aim back to the country that he had to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I never forgot my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities like everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ k is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; they can sell their harvest sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end , stability and prosperity are at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shar@@ k has made this journey himself . now he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Egyptian Parliament reviews a draft law which fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after regi@@ stering with a government agency .
users would have to register in order to be able to use social networks within six months of obtaining their full name as well as their ID number within six months .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or the final slaughter of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which was adverti@@ sed by six@@ teen members of parliament , is currently in front of the legislative as well as the Parliament &apos;s constitutional committee and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May another member of Parliament submitted a legislative proposal to introduce stric@@ ter sanctions for the ins@@ ult of the president or a senior official . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law proposed , such an act would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , so law experts from the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the law is passed , this can mean three years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imprisonment for the con@@ vic@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he exercised rob@@ bers against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup who had led to the dep@@ ortation of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited for four years in prison for more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because the prison management , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the def@@ end@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , such as weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in Giza spoke two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tun@@ isian activists hear of le@@ aked documents
in May , Tun@@ isian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices advoc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been heard chi@@ ef@@ ly into a le@@ aked action plan . said plan stems from the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly backed a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption .
the document published on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia denied the nom@@ ination of his sources under Article 11 of the Tun@@ isian Press Code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness .
does China want to force users of social media to present their cre@@ denti@@ als ?
according to new regulations of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media .
in addition , it is stated in the regulations that registration will be necessary with the full real name .
anal@@ ysts assume that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is un@@ clear to now how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to use these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
can we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat ? &quot;
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ or@@ ship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as an &quot; organiz@@ er of information broad@@ ening . &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services to organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make responsible services responsible for the removal of content and to force them on request to dis@@ close user data .
these websites currently include web sites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ klass@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the wi@@ ping Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia main@@ tain@@ ers refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications reported that the site was closed because it became an information source that co@@ operates with groups to address a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is thus , in addition to China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff around
after this week of le@@ aked documents , the UK government finds itself in the midst of a deliber@@ ate consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install cover@@ t software that de@@ cryp@@ ts data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted tel@@ cos and secret services on the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation still runs until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
