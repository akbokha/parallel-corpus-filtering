<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and practised his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was primarily a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnates by Julia Roberts as the law student who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court with judges who were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "free according to Method Man," "" "" "" "I was as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that is what I want to do with my life." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona was only exacerbating my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very contentious love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his opinion, he never holds behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague expressed it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people have responded to his statements and voted in favor of him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican preselection was the highest number reaching a candidate nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply believing human being with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps Weltanschauung did not agree with the current publisher of the Cincinnati Inquirer, the current publisher of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix Suns in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mumps Intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who struggled for the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leakey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counselors helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump slipped his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a halt and the counterpart of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, gave the presidency a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for trumps because they shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify the people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful, suggesting an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of whom most know, voted for trumps because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, would they perhaps say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, it is hard to forget the words of David Remnick who commenting the cruel decision to raise a man looking at contempt for those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "white ash" (editor of the Ü): as much as "White against all other ethnic groups"; word game from white in reference to the whites and whiplash, as the big Van Jones, has killed exactly what America has done so splendidly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have, America is welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trump, however, there is a vast majority of the White Americas on this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "" "" "no!" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no!" they cried and their voices became louder. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "would anyone, who is not like you, have a place in your America?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "" "" "NO" "" "" "" "!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later, he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son had fallen sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trump's land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled instruments Orchestra" by Catecha, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguayan city of Catecha?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located at the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students became central to the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a accidental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the buzz you learn day by day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero the children of Catecha - a village located on the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays capital - are based on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with remanufactured instruments made from local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Catecha, where the recyclers led by Favio Chávez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, saxophone, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were made of trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of Beatles, from Frank Sinatra and so on.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local economologist and musician of the children of Catecha, recalls:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in rubbish The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra playing instruments from recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic waste dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and him are the poorest - as the people in Catecha, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Country-fill harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices to share content together.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa it was known back then that this ship had already operated in Liberian waters illegal fishing before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly raised and little inclined to welcome a legal breaker of that kind on its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles swiftly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing license.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "" "", "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at its time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for looting the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was founded FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (stop Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that the premier had expelled from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"with this we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and mutually contribute to illegal fishing," says Tony Long, Director of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, which is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing from regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disrespect of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail boom, with the information between individual countries, the actions are now in real time, with trackable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas. also, such suspicious driving routes can be discovered - such as that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies can show whether the participating ships have a catch-catch license where they were on the road and possibly if they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information, meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay punishments, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is financially unable to pay." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consultant company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The previously mentioned platform was created to recover estimated $20 million in lost revenue that the eight members of the network HISH-i lose every year due to illegal fishermen entering into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other things, such activities include sailing under false flag, fake licensing, specifying fantasy names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"they purposefully use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-flawlessly organized control system," says Long. "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say 'You dared not run my port'.</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected vessels.</seg>
<seg id="127">It uncovered criminal networks that had spread bogus licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found volatile ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Thanks to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for combating crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "some of our studies run quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "" "" "says Bergh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that is constantly being developed helps to detect the illegal ships that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to conceal their activities and their position," says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems, for example, with which they can no longer be used by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">This is why Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is designed to help FISH-i find criminally acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations have actually influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and Marine Organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by displaying the position of every single tracking ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it simply makes sense," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to pool their resources for investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "" "" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which previously fished without licence and had hardly expected consequences, know now that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile reached a 33% increase in fisheries, since fishing boats are buying more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After the help of FISH-i Somalia to detect Greko 1, the inspectors were there on board towing nets.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries are also noticing these successes. "" the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries, "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear yearly by illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined forces, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they now also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. â With safety the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's latest member state Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph: in October it set Greko 1, a ship that was on the way under false flag. and not only was the ship on the way without licence and were used towing nets, which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also invaded in prohibited waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" with taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative working method for protecting the oceans truly works across the oceans.

<seg id="153">The movements in Venezuela appear to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the government's decision to halt the referendum on the inauguration of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This image of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government rejected Venezuela's request for a referendum on a referendum, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations about the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness by gathering in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the recovery of Venezuela) images of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andean regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central north-north federal Parliament of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the federal state Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation deteriorates continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current president Nicolás Maduro, but ultimately the holding of a re-election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Contributors to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the rate of inflation is estimated at 500% to the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together, urged the demonstrators to join a mass rally on 27 October and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan seat of government, on 3 November.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was annotated on Twitter as follows:</seg>

<seg id="177">Particularly large waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">The demonstrators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the government and armed supporters of the government, according to his own statement.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police, including this woman in the state of Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear a skirts, because otherwise you might see something that many national gardists don't have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic is already making the round, which forms the amount of suppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship suppresses the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an impeachment procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview of Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was first published on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentinian news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As meanwhile adult man, Quijano has now spoken against his father in the confines of the large La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, investigated the crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept his family secret.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years of age, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, torturer, and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father, Luis Alberto Quijano, was a civil servant. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the intelligence service division 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archival archive.</seg>
<seg id="212">However, this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who was charged with abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the abduction of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who over the years realized the extent of atrocities he had experienced as a boy, and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From sports hall to military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started taking me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I was friends with a boy who made combat sport.</seg>
<seg id="217">They all called him Kent.</seg>

<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you were friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Watch out that they will not kidnap you one day, and I'll have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military branch of Argentina's Revolutionary Workers Party.</seg>
<seg id="223">That is why he prohibited me to return to the sports hall again. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would be a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the base of the military, I had to destroy papers that had belonged to the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: University degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times after La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - everything was possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great lump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">That day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were turned off and stopped me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are being tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sped in and saw a couch where people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They rarely tied a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it with water and hunted him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="346">Revision of the original Joshua Levine photos.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving licence, last month witnesses of a very miserable translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign the Japanese word "Province" (koreiran sha), which means "older car driver" means falsely - but perhaps also with a malicious mind & # 8212; translated as "horrible motorists."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was shared in the social media many times.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which is published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it be such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "" "" "this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "" "" "" "said Holmes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The incorrect English translation was first removed. the name "terrible drivers" was later replaced by the appropriate, if grammatically not quite correct name "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture have apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are sorry that older people felt offended by inadequate correction (translation)," "" "" "" "said the police." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News started a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" has been denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of elderly drivers involved in accidents across the country is a cause of concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in the year 2005. this corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors suffered 1,803 of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors increased during the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The reporter, named by name, brought comments to the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo, showing the prejudices of some Japanese apparently against elderly drivers:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills in order to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue, who could translate the translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost-searching, or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees, nevertheless make translation internally. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is rated as the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and puzzling phrases caused by machine translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious imprints that often adorn t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as a jewelry. but from large companies or from the government, which have the means to ensure higher standards, it is possible to expect more accurate translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the Kyoto city will hopefully use a reputable source for its translations.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and censorship measures on the internet and television</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the "Navegar of Libertad" (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet presentations of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas, organized by opposition groups, resisting the government Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was snapped and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: enable your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet sites of Venezuelan providers are re-locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet website.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media has been hesitant in reporting on protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission on Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures, if they continued to report on the demonstrations because the Commission saw it as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">I signed up at @ vivoplaynet without cable TV and informative national TV channels.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is surprising that this is still more favorable than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two more online channels. this also applies to the Internet site where the National Assembly weaves its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS server requests certain domains to be correctly answered.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds erroneous or refuses to request such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third blocked channel, the transfer was discontinued on Thursday 6th April when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on air again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes Venezuelans more difficult to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools"), edited and reproduced by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house full of pride said about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "" "" "she said." "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as a Criadita for the family. as Criminta, one refers to Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another, more rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children must spend countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice, referred to as Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay as a result of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, for the feeling of gratitude that critically inoculates the Criminas guarantees silence in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">There is, on the one hand, the family whom her daughter believes in the belief that she can complete her education, improve her position in society, and "make something out of itself" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl and justifies its exploitation with faith is that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will only experience it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the hidden in paraguayan households, has a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín arrived at the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent punches. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was the household of Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who worked as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira beat Marín as long as she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela took responsibility for the Criadazgo practice rooted in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They described the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozens of people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be "no other Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely spread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," said Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The couple's neighbors and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a quick investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be indicative - if for the first time in the Paraguays story a case of Criadazgo is coming to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The Daily Life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Crimean tas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she was done with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because it had to make supper for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but she didn't have unlimited food. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the householder than food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 until 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">Some evenings forced the owner Alvarenga to stand next to him and read editorial articles like "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media on the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">He considered it intelligent, but did not stop with it. "the landlord had found someone who listened while he spoke about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they didn't often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would learn" bad habits "there again. so they thought that Alvarenga, who belonged to the indigenous group of Guaraní, would again speak their native Guaraní at home.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose again the education they had made possible for them.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never talked about is bullying and the chicanes to which Criaditas are exposed when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to go home. I didn't have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could bring a sentence of up to six months imprisonment or a buckle.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, composed of six paragraphs and circulated in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs over the Internet and uses it to communicate with others through voice, video news and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the design does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration. unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="524">This contribution by Todd Reubold was published in the original at Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions.</seg>
<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north east of Iraq, the animal rights activists Hana Ahmed Raza and their team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq aim to protect the spirit-like Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards, which fights through Africa and Asia, belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). in total there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and as they find less and less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big carnivore exists.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild boar is low and goes towards zero. as the team in the video states that they have a shot of a large cat in the camera trap, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza passionately demonstrates a different side of her country, which is not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs from Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">She has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring that protected areas are set up for wild animals in the Kurdistan region.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and is still busy rebuilding.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for the northeast of Japan, documented the progress made over the last six years to rebuild the life of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. the Prefecture of Miyagi was an ettish prefectures in Japan's Northeast which experienced both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the Neighborhood Development Fukushima and Iwate were forced to leave because the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">For this reason, Fukushima prefecture had an atomic accident, already alone 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report by Kahoku Shimpo shows from local point of view the progress made six years afterwards to rebuild the life of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper contains both statistics of the Japanese Reunion Agency and the survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">Residential construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that as far as December 2015, 77 percent of the planned replacements are completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The greatest success among the three prefectures was achieved by Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses whereas Fukushima forms 70 per cent of the total light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, six years after the catastrophe, we still endeavoured to relocate evacuated accommodation to final replacement houses for six years after the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 percent of the evacuated people who lived after the disaster in shelters were converted into final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by misfortune, opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, Fukushima has resumed only 30 percent of the fishing ports.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have largely affected agrarian land in the three prefectures of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 per cent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent of farmland used in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fukushima, are located in the nuclear plywood zone.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants feel it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population preparing for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine the overall picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated people.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed said that there was still not enough disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuate from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue for the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Out of 160,000 evacuated evacuations from Fukushima, nearly 60,000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been relocated to permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, more than 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophes most of the evacuated ones are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across from other countries that speak a different language, the differences seem to be bigger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often sees that one connects more than it appears at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely at these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we address topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members, who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veronika Krikoni talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how a migration has consolidated her affection to the Iranian culture; Violeta Camarasa writes about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week. last Friday, a police officer had killed him during a demonstration in Goiânia with a baton against his head. nationwide millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity measures.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the Federal University of Goiás has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on him this Saturday and have now transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is regarded as critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures, the face of the police officer is also recognizable, who attacked with a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás declared that Sampaio had been suspended from active service until the investigation of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he strikes in Goiânia with his baton on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten up by a demonstrator and landing on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the whole repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desneuralador," a media activist from Goiânia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the web in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics rushed to him shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from a different perspective, has also appeared in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below, one sees the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state, Internet users have donated 10.000 Brazilian reais (about 2,700 euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Goiânia while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="616">Policemen sat at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had set up a stage for speakers, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">Euro MP Flavio Serafini, social and peace party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against demonstrators via loudspeaker announcements.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest papers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media has swapped street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window to illustrate their title pages illustrating their title pages.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo preferred a cover story with a fire-set bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a specific cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be acknowledged if you are strictly opposed to any kind of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" obtains an absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical acts of violence of the military police are obscured by headlines with the title "protesters on confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The villages forgotten by the industralization in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba joined the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">Gregorio Arleé Mañalich Municipality, located in the western Cuban province of Mayagque, is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no significant crop of sugar on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories have been paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After dropping the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the factory gradually lost its plant until only the scaffolding was left out of steel and concrete.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resign and commute every day to factories that are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who stands up every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not deprive his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time are back in operation, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds you that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests aren't any news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality has already seen better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again over a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound must remain, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), raw sugar exports would generate around $85 million for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "" "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years there was a shutdown of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is "deception."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents were of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first release year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was official documents, which were only distinguished by the parts that would be removed, the addresroom and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve every withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was taken over and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in use," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, awaits the retirement in another plant, which is Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory in which he helped to build.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this by means of hip-hop, thanks to a number of traveling workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">Since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres for youth groups to teach songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cree communities in North-Quebec and then worked with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStar.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop envisages that the young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptance" or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the territory of the tribe of the Kitumkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells, for example, the history of Highway 16, also called Highway of Tears, a road section in West kanah where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people were not always able to master the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The youngsters were given some help from Gary Jolly of the Northstars Hip-Hop Group, who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is at his disposal, just as a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">"" "" "" "this is the day when you will hear our cry." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as a youth have lost our way in life</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, close to the entrance Shokuhin sanpuru ("Plastische Models of the Courts") are issued by each dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga for more than 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them. however, a new trend is turning them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the Shokuhin santuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic rubbers decorated mobile tapes as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial food were transformed into kitschy collectibles, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin refrigerators magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was converted into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a handy stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">This part was also part of the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the East.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile-designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case ikura and salmon roe are used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there someone who would say: "wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon roe?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, for example, to surprise colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and wristbands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other skurrile plastic dishes can be found at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # buzzing, with flaws at the flaws found in the # # staff.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry, for example with the Shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="744">The following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourning or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind every corpse, behind each bone-find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político provides the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trafficking") which is intended to give these victims a voice and stories of people who were in the struggle between the law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime not only lets us fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to travel many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how afraid life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews in just one day.</seg>

<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've known illness and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the cover pages with images that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only person who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues writing:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug trafficker) if he is big. and it is not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "" "" "the inaction of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified by being" "" "" "" "paving." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not moving and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the Capital District: how a family has been plundered with threats." in this she describes how an armed criminals bared money from their business for month, until they destroyed not only the business, but also tore up their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of this never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concludes her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want others to be arrested, as one does not know when they will kidnap or kill you.</seg>

<seg id="799">"" "" "" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation-drawn generation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, roast potatoes, keep tortillas up and make "chchi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells about the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years earlier when he was only a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody corpse of his father, shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez saw this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Government Council for Public Safety and the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Prosecution counted 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," animal político 2015 has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tortured the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="819">But what is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a horrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misleading to depict tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample coverage of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank truck passed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thereby devastated. roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank truck fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Representatives of the authorities described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses including a cinema close by, full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses were scattered and cored corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to be unrecognizably.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture entitled "This is Nigeria." from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies lined up on the floor while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But history does not end here.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eye witnesses reported drastically the atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "" "" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "" "" "no one left behind to count corpses," "" "" "" "said a Human Rights Watch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated exemplarily.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo, when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of false attributions. Africa Check has documented assignments in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further contributing personal comments such as this example falsely links the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection with arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly pursuit of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning detection published by the United Nations, those who could flee could flee blows, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, Posts like the following, who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site, falsely claiming that President Myanmar's Than has said that monks and politicians have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to depict this information.</seg>

<seg id="860">Traces of this false stubble range back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using an "reverse image search" you can see how far information can cross borders.</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverted picture search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures under 18.8 billion pictures (as of 3 May 2017), which are very similar to the mentioned image from DR Congo.</seg>

<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times). but the messages related thereto were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Chinese), 2014.</seg>

<seg id="926">In all these cases, which only appeared considerably after the disaster of 2010, the picture ultimately bears a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that pass these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in regard to greater discussions on the silence related to the assassinations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the murder of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underrated compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers cannot believe these images any longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are dozens of people who are unintentionally allowed to drink the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and does the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that holding images of a refusal is equal to recognizing the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images desensitize readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about forcible representations in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about situations in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be replaced by context or completely improper style.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, every study of false attributions should also take into account how international it can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons used in accordance with CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. insurmountable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">These words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone stubbornly resist any attempt at a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or an expression does not suffice, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context is necessary in order to understand precisely what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for a whole period of time.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog, for example, you can find words from the Mwotlap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - get tired of your parents in recognition of how they have been working for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words spoken in the Hunsric language spoken in parts of Brazil such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or sloth one feels after getting warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words about his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They disclose other cultures, reveal other forms of thought and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site would like to publish more of these "irreplaceable" words while showing how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the "Treasure Languages" which are highly appreciated by untranslatable are invited to upload their favorite words here.</seg>

<seg id="970">The island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood of flood and landslide in this decade.</seg>
<seg id="971">Caused by the monsoon, normally used by the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attanagalu of Oya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country have stepped across the shore by heavy rains.</seg>
<seg id="972">According to a statement from the Sri Lanka catastrophes of 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and nearly 100 people were missing because of the floods and mudslides.</seg>
<seg id="973">More than 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and about 100,000 people were transported to 304 safety places.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rains left on Saturday (May 27) and the water levels in some areas went slowly.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the areas affected and still inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">Floods in Tawalama City with water levels of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users like Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka are providing regular updates to the flood situation.</seg>

<seg id="981">The Air Force provided five aircraft for rescue operations, and another five are completed to transport emergency deliveries to the residents, which were flooded in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organizations and startups have also announced their willingness to help.</seg>
<seg id="983">Facebook pages such as Help Flood Victims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Information Desk- Sri Lanka provide important information on flood conditions and humanitarian aid.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They abducted me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not all look the same.</seg>

<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim in different ways. but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>

<seg id="1012">This has happened to the poet whose poetry is mostly sold in America: Rumi.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are prevented from carrying their headscarf in public buildings and Saudi Arabian, Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>

<seg id="1033">Because of these stories, which we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "others."</seg>

<seg id="1123">I am concerned about the realities and the story I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter, but who made me today an unbound Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Things I left behind in my speech like a bread crumbling track.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Things that perhaps wake memories, as in all the intersections that make up our humanity, a story may lurk, where someone is made to another.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Right now, on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley, conversations take place during the 8th Annual Conference on Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="1127">More than a hundred academics talk about our problems with the "other," "structural racism" and "American militarism."</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all have to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why do I tell that here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are led and people will be enthroned by the creativity of the "other" in the public imagination, four decades ago, he was the academic of Stanford.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being consciously and unconsciously to consolidate the "other"; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupation that we have no president, the chocolate cake, while he already encapsulated countries and "other made" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1133">It starts here with all of us.</seg>
<seg id="1134">Initiative for Narrative Art aims to preserve urban linguistic diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr users Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the unmissable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of language from major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already held events since 2015, there is a risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project, the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "" "" "while listening is often associated with understanding" "" "" "" "these events" "" "" "" "instead" "" "" "" "to appreciate, to feel, to touch." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers can first and then translate their story into their own language and then explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story-teller, their devotion and representation will lead to the fact that the audience lets themselves be informed.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this turn the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamus tells the Fabel of the rabbit and the baboon in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the importance of his fable, John Nyamus is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Until now, the events of Treasure Language storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can come into contact with TLS to organize their own storytelling shows.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian Palestinian web developer, Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture organised in Berlin, an event of the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, published excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: a collective follow-up).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published last year and available here license-free, contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book aims to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what is the real cost to which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the directory of the Adra prison, where he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled Collective Memories gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, and immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us beginning to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra prison, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015, she was contacted by persons who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his place of residence and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was more predictive than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, merging Greek-Roman architectural styles with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would put everything in place to wipe out this architecture, which is not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be of inestimable value for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel has not yet completed this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire lifetime dreaming of freedom and bass taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was detained.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other detainees to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a professional diary that she wrote to her husband during the years 2012 to 2015 when he was detained.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is licensed free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It Happens":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens at every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I will sink in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the mind in the moment that we embrace,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That any of the dangers does not matter to me,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and guards</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the crowding in the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I insert into every detail of your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">Which I bear with my passion,</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes fail</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I let another piece of my soul leave with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I return swiftly to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To bring back all those moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And about your absence to cry and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I convince myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">Ghazi wrote on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bassel:</seg>
<seg id="1243">One year passed, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">While doing so, during</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage of monsters</seg>
<seg id="1247">Basle's history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of protests against Bashar al-Assad's regime in 2011, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or subjected to violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Since 2011, according to the international human rights organization Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in custody since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we reiterate our call in the hope that we have to do so for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption sentenced Director after Hafpostponement again on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambians responded with anger to a corruption case in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants of 54 million Metical (about 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">In 2016, Cambaza was released for good management and immediately called for his return to the company, which happened on 19th April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which submitted the motion, there would be no reason for Cambaza to return to his old post as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents do not mean the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integrida de Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the decision of the company to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our judicial system," "" "" "" "CIP." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note of is that the company should also introduce a disciplinary action against the contracted one.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambique social media, also declines this attitude and considers the case as "disgusting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after having been sentenced to prison and half of whom served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza likes to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil, says the director no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state, because he insulted him, I can't believe that people are rewarded in such a way that the state has already so badly offended the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks the moral to return and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served only himself in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Mahel, that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel, not only will the Mozambique be remembered as the first independent president, but also as a keen, intertwined and - by the way - prophetic speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous verbal representations was when he vigorously confirmed that "an ambitious man was capable of all, including the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said, "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is criminal at the same time. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also declining:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Sentenced to 22 years in prison, Cambaza was imprisoned for 10 years and was released.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today the company, in which he dislikes money, puts it under contract again. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - яα5.2 DOG (@ azzy _ Rafik) 12th May 2017</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored a lot of users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The burmesan word "Kalar pae" means chick peas or splits.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network shared their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censors the word "Kalar" or "the" (in burmesan script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of the Hassan language in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely degrading connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of useful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts where they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed skepticism in order to express their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings, which have the same sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, stool on Burmeric is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spider-se), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookeeper Aung-Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmeric - is very similar to racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hats believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook has to be more analytical before it eradicates all the posts that are suspected of being racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (Chair) and "Kalar pae" (split peas).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech get a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to cut off their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who spread hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1313">Social networking experiences in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks will simply begin to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">Author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was told the listings, posts and sharing of content for 24 hours because the mail "didn't meet the Facebook Community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their views against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author expressed his opinion of why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the burmesan internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like "chair" or "pea curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the distorted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship ensured a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech in order to see if their posts are taken from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not contain any hate speech, but were removed anyway:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word" "" "" "" "Kalar" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "" "" "the post says" "" "" "" "If you are a doctor, then heal people?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should also incite the violence in the communities of Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control the proliferous hate speech on its Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at contexts rather than code-focused initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1346">Despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contract partner of the UN Children's Rights Convention, the minors are defined as "every man under the age of 18."</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and at 18 there were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical office of Central Statistics confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married from 1997 to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements aimed at abolishing the laws of child marriage followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children's marriage, they should,, try to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually uncomplicated thing, and at some point, doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But in early 2017, the bill was decided against child marriage - despite 4 senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law proclaim." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against child marriage was approved in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having been approved in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws of the child were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who suffers a ministerial post in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk that has concealed the heart of the matter, but do you know what? the childrens' marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth almost every prize.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to complete the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas says:,, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The Ehegesetz has been approved.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, votes - 35 for this - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Follow Muta, a member of the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The divorced age in Trinidad and Tobago now amounts to 18 years irrespective of the religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The amendment to the marriage proposal was decided today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 representatives in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All deputies that were against have voted in favour of the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The childrens are legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...) # childtestimonagudabuse.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who challenged him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible catch comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj announced his intention to take legal action, the law should be passed, and he seems to redeem his pledge.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General of Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users wished they would address the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion so universally, in a way that only causes panic and displeasure, if we, instead of talking about the problem that the state, our daughters against it, would be abused by large, hard-boiled men who are opposed to them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where child marriage is legal or still the norm in different gradations, although there are laws that prohibit them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, in contrast to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has blocked the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockade.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using bypassing tools for blocked websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times also reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirror sites (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (calculator computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is accessible however, in spite of the legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports on its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we've heard the messages (about the locking of Wikipedia), we used it all to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. this way, there is the possibility to read the contents on a decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklope.org, a mirror site from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open-source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors if locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and staff at Mozilla at Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One attacks another URL, which is not the original. that which one sees then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server is directing the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A refreshing rhinoceros, chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed out colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home town right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Neptune's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps him:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just returned home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the bank of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the Leopard was, and I immediately started to kneeling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he stood face to face with Tigers:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be bothered by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the King of the bush appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at us and he stares at me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Neptune nature and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Otters at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living close to tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid speaking with the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "" "" "instead they use a pronoun or say" father of my child. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women give that they respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, maintain this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by the Indian State of Odisha by a bogus court and expelled from her family and village community after having addressed a married relative with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also is not common among men. however, they have far fewer remittances to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of the 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the Campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and advocates the exploitation of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">She has been working with her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as the Children's Council until the exile of HIV and AIDS infected, and guides these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was about women who did not name their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Saying that the names of their husbands do not speak loudly, is a custom that they have all convicted and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not observe this is regarded as a deceitful woman, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini relates:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him on his name from now on." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, affectionate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does this mean that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "" "" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Paz from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women should never pronounce the names of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini relates:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was chuckled during the whole exercise; another decided to release all the frustration of him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the adrenalin rush of having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared at her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "" "" "another woman said:" "" "" "" "Rohini thought I should do it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started out in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred point on the forehead that shows the spellatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would carry the Innoberred point if he did." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the other women have not stopped completely, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the club's club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what" "" "" "", "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In recent months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives. they danced and sang and talked about things they had never imagined before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say things loud, no matter how small they are.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only wore saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them this is okay, but some wanted a salist-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, wearing; they didn't dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the merits of one's own choice of clothes, the morals associated with the saris and much more, Rohini were smuggled their own pairs of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion group so that the women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are getting rolling slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have made only small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women rehearsed it a few times but then stopped telling the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, are still doing it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberred on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes that they wish to achieve in their lives - like filing for more freedom of movement or their own coat-of-arms - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I'm it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and reports to other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here quite quickly realized that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">"" "" "" "good morning!" "" "" "" "today is the Beatles" "" "" "" "Day of Remembrance in Japan." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll is supposed to represent John Lennon or not.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of members for organ trafficking, presumably for superstitious purposes, disturbs the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government has now called a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi are being used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is a local superstition that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia said to the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, is people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that in 2016 the UN conducted a mission in the South African country to examine this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with alcoholism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the town of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who intend to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique, men in Mozambique are the target of ritualistic attacks, warned the Mozambique police after the latest murders of three men-headed men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique said that the local police already did the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, for presumably superstitious rituals, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims had power in the head power, the wealth generive.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of the blog gers poor Snaippa, who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MNEs A MOST, THE SICH is ashamed A country in which people would have shame to go to the streets and would not hurt others or even take their lives to earn their bread, a land in which neither the albinos nor bald or bald men would be hunted for superstitious purposes or "black magic" that aim to get too quick wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some could not miss the opportunity for macabren humor.</seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida Machado, scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and avid Twitter users, tweetete that both the chief of the district Morrumbal, Pedro Sange and the police spokesman Zambézias, Inácio Dina, are both bald:</seg>

<seg id="1625">Free Bassel: citizen Under Serious Threat, December 2012 (in English) Nine responses of the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel laureates and Dissident Liu Xiaobo</seg>
<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state risk) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case "an internal matter." a spokesman tells him that he considers it "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China still receives calls from the international community, Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or permit him to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summed up some reactions abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was stalled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were continued in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China, since exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was asked to free Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Liu as she said in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr Liu's wife and family members." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1650">They are to meet and receive all the visits they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">Us Ambassador Terry Branstad informed that the Americans "wish him that he has the possibility of treating abroad, in so far as he can help him in his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the AFP news agency on 27 June that the embassy urges Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The US embassy demanded an angry response from China, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "no country has the right to interfere and irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley commented that China should offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical treatment of his choice based on the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1659">Germany, Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin, hope that Liu will get all the medical support he needs, "and that a" humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority. "</seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on the G20 Summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had big concerns about whether the vortex around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called on China to provide a suitable medical care to Liu and give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu Anwalt told AFP before that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and allow for the exercise of these rights" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France, France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo will receive all the treatments he needs, regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information out whether France will ultimately receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan, Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Land Affairs in Taiwan prompted China on June 27 to release Liu and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Party of Congo also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed himself in a statement on 28 June in Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem foolish, since Singapore is recognised internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the Minister remarked that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports Singapore to be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "" "" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "" "" "reverse logic" "" "" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercising of power in Singapore." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this precious land, we can say that we are not a country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it, it inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the point of the theme, the good old lyre of the authoritarian rulers, who pretended to be democrats, will leave the rotated logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the responses to his American guests in the last week of Shanmugam were really non-responses to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He flared up relevant questions with non-responses rationally.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to clarify his mind as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to elucidate this point as long as he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points to the criticisms that one should begin reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore was rather a "city" than a country, "he explained why the Singapore elections were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore to cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "" "" "when he said, Singapore" "" "" "" "is no country," "" "" "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, the leader of a growing generation that makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another matter.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes it, and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review disintegrates the weak points of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam "commit a mistake" or was it a Freudian advocate?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country do the sovereign rights of the city go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of grave importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapur do their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who needs to pay back our Prime Minister?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The magazine Journey of a Decade tends to move to Bejahung, Singapore and has always been a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence appears to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>

<seg id="1737">The Canadian Ned Flanders.</seg>
<seg id="1738">Screenshot from a YouTube video.</seg>
<seg id="1739">Global Voices recently asked his editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect of your home or homeland?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series, which reveals rumors about certain parts of the world and a different facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">"" "" "" "the question that is most asked for me in Japan is:" "" "" "" "are you Americans?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I answer. "I'm from Canada." since 1994 I live and back in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">My clarification usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature." many Canadians perhaps cook inwardly against anger when they are held for Americans, but that doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know himself, there is little that separates us from Americans of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians attach a Canadian flag visibly to their rucksack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, on the other hand,....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried small maple leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Same-sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">Everyone seems to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We evidently say very often "apologies."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country in relation to ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these guys south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate this.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends, whom I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It wouldn't matter to me if I would like to confuse me with Johnny from Dallas for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: to be called "nice" means to be spooky - just like the good-natured, gentle but tragically unimportant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (which has its own Canadian doubler).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada were really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means being inconspicuous and uninteresting and not earning any attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a chief feature of the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps just cool humility.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians do not often talk about the fence with their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open kindness that I now connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau took the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada downright sexy.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Music video of a pop band parodils Thailands Junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">One of Thailand's famous pop band released a music video that erodes the Junta, which took power in 2014 and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government, continue to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band and colour describes a young man who tells him what precepts his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was vowed by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video of the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">In the first three days alone, the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.254 times divided and received 8,800 likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially how it behaves with the country's position under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the video, which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has followed in recent three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of girls" may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which provides absolute decision making over important national issues to the commander-in-chief of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program of "change in settings" of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered as critics of Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army to monitor and prosecute the online content and to prosecute those who accused the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand opts for "Lese Majestic" (Majestic insult).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was declared in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, the army came to a coup.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U-boats, although safety experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The video even shows how people are thrown into a black van before placing them in an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences, they should offend the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile, the teaser of the songs showed members of the band who imitated the Salut "The Tribute of Panem," which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharaeava are located in the coal-basin of Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Eurasia, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together in the Soviet era.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today mostly Russians and Abchasen are living in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people living in these spiritual cities.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the area amounted to 16,000 people after it had barely increased over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989, around 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1841">Families are also involved in the subsistence economy (farming of agricultural products for personal use) such as cattle breeding, beekeeping and vegetable farming.</seg>
<seg id="1842">It's difficult to talk about the rounds.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way to the migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals pink frame and gold coloured ear rings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless, hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez narrates, people come to full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">Currently it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outdoors on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are ill, they buy them drugs that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a Joghurtbart) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "" "" "he answers with a smile." "" "" "" "I really feel it fits her, because African women are very nice women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and Africans are often travelling together and that the Africans are already talking about Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, it began its journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months. he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he replies smiling. "" "" "" "" we will always stay in touch. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez narrates that her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Wife Ramírez is perhaps very well-known here, but it is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started helping them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">Currently there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking station outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela states that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I lived in the United States," he says. "" "" "" "" I have experienced what they are experiencing. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and do not help others. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children before people who wanted to extort money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single person, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step should be.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, the travelers consult their phones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy about her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves with many photos in her album.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she briefly introduces her to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats it every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi issued a cell phone notification in which it notifies the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "" "" "in the message, it is said that the app" "" "" "" "preventing it from accessing terrorist information" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because, shortly after they had installed the app, they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police informed that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and remotely control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this app with the filters for minors is meant to help children develop a healthy lifestyle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1971">Of course, an app with these functions can be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reporting on digital censorship in China most often focus on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south, reality is often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the areas of conflict, the authorities often prescribe extreme censorship and surveillance measures, as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" (the Directorate of the Directorate of Printing Newspapers, published in China) showed photos of a checkpoint where police checked the residents indiscriminately if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification asked people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected by a checkpoint with a device without this software, you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest-technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (by the local section) also published a Jingwang product description from which the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After Jingwang's installation, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a response to the orders of the city party council to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All governmental branches, authorities and affiliated institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, cell phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2001">They arrested me and my father three times, but that was not enough for me to learn "my lesson," as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="2002">He demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>

<seg id="2090">Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he slows down to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and back to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his chapped lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and had forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as fellows (such as: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their tried-and-tested opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed music.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as oriental alism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these themes are not only relevant in his home town of Amman, but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as a person who is not limited by limits in his mind, and can feel with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special reluctance against US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation" - this is what he calls himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't think so, because of my own circumstances," "" "" "" "says Hdaib." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so because I am a man," while he poured into water dissolved Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a senile hot boy's day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the pieces speak lukewarm coffee and the swaths of the Kent-cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when looking at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan - to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontssinger Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert announcement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">MP and former media spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "just" was canceled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism, which questioned the established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to choose "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not be simply shallow rhetoric, but in fact reflect a more and more crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib moved traditional gender norms to Leibe by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years Jordan has increased the number of 'Ehrenmorse' - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary morays reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law to fight against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of inner-family violence can "be kept in prison for an indefinite period of time," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary for the wife to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Even Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well known for not shy away from topics that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, full of explicit reference to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "I was inscribed in politics," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In Lawla al 3aib and in "ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, one verse often repeats:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where, in his words, you can "get what you want" - whether it is faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay men and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya in order to find out later that his comments were torn, twisted and censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a edited version" "" "" "", "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuevo, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nudie, who was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can't Jordan do it?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">There is nothing new in the hashemian realm that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service notes several former members of the government and members of the teachers "association, arguing that they have critically expressed themselves on the issues raised in the country with the corruption that was deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has prevented Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that is Hdaib - consists of slow, deliberate and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the aid of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, street unitions and on artificial ways. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Centre on Crisis Reporting, which includes the Aman as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumes that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in many parts of Tohocus in August. another theory states that the trucks, drums and dancing came over more than a thousand years and from a time when armies from the west of Japan marched into the Northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab a couple of great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A Community Center in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been watching the Meguro Gajoen again for a long time: two trucks are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true one - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of a 18-meter high carriage was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outer appearances and body care have rarely been as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and to promote a legitimate profession like those of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) have led to getting more and more normal citizens into the skilled hands of hairdressers who can reproduce these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the outermost limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other in order to show who can create the most excentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile of Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hairdressers and to receive training in hairdressing, which enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Prior to the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because from love to the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the "love message on guerilla fighters," published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important to accommodate people who feel upset?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of the young Columbian activist Leonardo Párraga from the foundation Bogotart and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement, which forms the end point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signatory of the treaty was considered to be so important that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of Colombians, there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to a war rhetoric and carried out their weapons around the clock, must now be integrated into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">In turn, Colombian society, accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take up in its ranks and support it in setting up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The target of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerilla fighter, which is to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconcile arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for ex-fighters of the FARC who now find their place in society and have to build a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," she says.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i would never have thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members acted as they had previously done in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive commands, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything in between," said the student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go into because next to him on the bed was a MGL-Granatwerfer, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Palace.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "" "" "he replied," "" "" "" "Hello, what do they do?" "" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "never before in my life has someone written something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "" "" "suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him, and sat down beside the gardermen.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was also tired of the war, I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life as a war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside that awaits us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "" "" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some leaders of the FARC joined a discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up when there was war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why FARC leaders declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state looked upon the entire Columbian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "" "" "the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "" "" "one of them said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard before and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people whom I often had seen as monsters and even hate, were only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much harm, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were informed that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take up arms, lift themselves up and protest for their rights.</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will impede many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a trans-woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no men more in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made the round through WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying: "here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "" "" "then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" "" "" "" "how long will you still honor the family, you shame?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right wing of the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospitals were you placed - in the men or women of the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are out of date, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running up without the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grosny and say that I didn't change my sex, that all was just bad talk, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "" "" "they said to her," "" "" "" "You have brought a monster that has damaged not only your family but the entire republic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "" "" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she laid a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window, a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it stood under the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"" "" "" "I bought her without registering me, without identification, without anything." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think you'd be safe, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are in. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "" "" "only to prove to you: it is the number 115." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually try to look at the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed behind?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I talked to someone who had been in argun for one and a half months." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told us that during the Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably invite relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to ask Cadyrov's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people had not simply disappeared, they were deliberately submerged in order to radically change themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, until now they have not been presented as bandits, there have been no reports yet. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else wouldn't you have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Grosny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russia originally wanted to introduce us to" "" "" "" "civilisation" "" "" "", "but eventually thrown us back into the Stone Age." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed eyelashes, wore tubular jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Security Ministry of Sharia has never compromised me a hair too." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharkiah Kharda. that means: "don't think about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just shut their eyes off you because they believed they were ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never struck me.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period stop?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long before Kadyrov came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed at once looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In that time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic ever deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what's your favorite activity now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 Dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacreffs, meetings, I escort them to the hospital and help them get food tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not spend a penny for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people themselves when I clicked off breeding places.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you carry a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">This is the nature that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to make you white with foam before the mouth that there are no gays in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have what the cabardines have, the Russians also have; on the whole planet they exist - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practising Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about transience to men who love men, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I'm myself now.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase in suicides within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The incineration of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is characterized by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness to be able to create inability for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who wish to work and remain anonymous in Ahvalz.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube took the moments after he had lighted himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month was hanging out several others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless because of the persecution of the Iranian government, unable to feed their families and pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi are suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a deep economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to contemplate their living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most abundant and most valuable useful areas for Iranian farming.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets less of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahwazi Arabs to create jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a large number of dams, the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are surrounded.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only been used to aggravate the devastation caused by dryness, and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawk youth has now risen to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, announced that 5% of Ahvalzis who had a job completed primary school, 55% finished secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohii, an Iranian genealogist human rights activist with resident in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," led to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging from Ahvalz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not pretend to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their pros and surnames to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, as even Arab names in the workplace may not be tolerated, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activists beat the alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world wakes up and takes notice of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectional"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of Afroféminas.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put out well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all feminists inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women today still earn less money than men, despite the same education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and faiths.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to talk about skin colour, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; if I mention the way we have always been abused physically, psychologically and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But are all agreed that women - all women - should come together to "lift their voices" and "Kumbaya, my lord" to sing "in order to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalised form of racially motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women from other ethnic groups and places of origin deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background will be referred to the school more often than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background face a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership as white women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join me as a black woman in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustice in her thinking, which relate both to sex and to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sojourner complained in 1851 in her speech: "am I not a woman?" and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is historically an abusive and marginalized being.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to close white women the importance of overlapping skin colour and gender. for some of them continue to keep silent the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and join me in the movement of womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman instead of campaigning for a white-feminist paradigm that is so obstinate that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever for us to define black women according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres that are created by us for ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana vasi: Reclaiming (about: Africa-Womanism: how we recapture ourselves) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and where the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call for separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement that the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and, as a result of my being, as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life has neither passed nor ignored nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">When women give advertisement at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must at all be reported to the law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inhalts1 beats and Statistiken2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that does not undercut Paraguays Laws: good approach, inadequate implementation impacts and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institute in Paraguay. "there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay" she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 people attended the District Attorney's Office for domestic violence. 70% of them were about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the police were reported by women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements due to domestic violence among the peace courts. here, too, 86% of women's ads came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the adverts 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "on any woman who will report in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do so.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "on any woman who refuses advertisement for physical abuse, two women who do not do so," "" "" "" "she stated at the end of 2014." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide in Paraguay is not an own crime, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, all ten days a woman died in Paraguay because of violent acts by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that undertakes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but then she did. this should repent her forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos. but for two years she inherited the psychological violence in his turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would once become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happens to women who are too submissive, because they let themselves be fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two years relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen for so long from Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It almost seemed as though they wanted to say that victims of abuse would at least have some complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years in order to prove that her former partner mistreated her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse in some way.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's adverts with the authorities remained without result and also from her relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She conducted a trial against her former partner who developed into an unpredictable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of their former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed at the paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porellas (# fürst).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non natives) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law envisages to declare Femalid on an independent criminal offence and to punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the text was changed in a number of points in order to also gain Members of the Law who feared that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions would be levelled, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill foresees most of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs which the victims of violence need to carry on themselves if they just want to submit an ad and want to get a safe place to place the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">A rethinking must take place here, so that violence is not seen as a normal thing.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Anyone who is silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the perpetrators of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must reimburse for such a long time until mistreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law had been changed, among other things a passage that the partners had called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions about the changes are going apart.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Egyptian authorities closed the independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn for its reporting on corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison, where he served a year-old sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and tried, but later released again.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been reigning since 1970 by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after leaving his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a state empire.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to its role as a single sultan, the chief offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, supreme commander of the armed forces, finance ministers, foreign ministers, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces, particularly domestic secret services, public freedoms, including press freedom, restricting and torture human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to freely express their views on the country's public affairs such as corruption in public authorities and institutions online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on Azamn, their closing and imprisonment three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper reported since its inception in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, editor-in-chief of Azamn, arrested in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 an article entitled "High-ranking parties tie the hands of justice."</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials were accused of having put pressure on the Supreme Court judge in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS received the deputy chief editor Yousef Al-Haj, who had acted as chief editor for Al-Maamaris arrest.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that "the publication and dissemination of the paper on any way, including online, is prohibited from August 9, 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first trial in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri took place before the trial in Musat.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were condemned, among other things, for disturbance of the public order, abuse of the Internet, and "undermining the prestige of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, al-Haj was found guilty of violating a ban on publication and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3,000 omanic rial (US $7800). in addition, a one-year ban on professional ban was imposed on both journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of the use of an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order.</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a deposit of 5000 omanic rial (13,000 US dollars) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri at a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for a year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 following a six-month prison sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj remained in prison, where he served his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also called on the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the "Azamn" newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the Court to allow Azamn to resume, the newspaper is still exposed to attacks by the Government of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On January 8, the Minister of Information issued an order, with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information received another order in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and the minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appeal to reequip the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuing shutdown of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press has been violated in Oman in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Other violations include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatine and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to set up its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the continuing shutdown of Azamn and the arrest of journalist Al-Haj, the impression arises that the authorities are still unwilling to put an end to extensive violations of the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls on the authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. to release Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally;</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need on-site medical research: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines absent from the global health care system, which cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more severe impact in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Infectious Disease in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself studied at the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Sábian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Sábian National Programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I'm just starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">FAQ: what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always be recipients instead of being a creator.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">FAQ: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">FAQ: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic education, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">FAQ: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa from western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: it is often the limited speed of things to do, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines can only make articles available for payment (the so-called "paywall"), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about possible solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding lettuce in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties such as Outredmm, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work has been limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue using them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only applied to individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or card types. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition Morton still breeds lettuce, but it takes longer because his work is still more difficult due to more and more limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is as if there is a boulder in a river that I have to share." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "" "" "so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the tradition of breeding," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" "" "I think these patents on salads go too far." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand trial, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented. "so he continues as well as possible and tries to breed those features he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful, however, and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement growing steadily in the US and throughout the world: open source Breeding (open source breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have cultured and eaten red romerlettuce of the Outredmm variety in the "glasshouse" of the station, where it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement originates from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (Initiative für "Open Source" seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders simply allow others who purchase their seeds, breed it to breed their own varieties, and do not make it straight away - two aspects that are prohibited or required by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Darker views</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emerized professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member, Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants are both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in larger gatherings like biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the open-source movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seeds," he says, and takes part in the increasingly common mergers in the global agribusiness industry, the latest examples are the amalgamation of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "" "" "food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to allowing others to remain freely available to others. in contrast, their approach is in contrast to patented seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material that is thus becoming increasingly available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of OSSI, has engaged in his doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all card features are protected as intellectual property, making it possible for plant breeders either not at all or only complicatedly.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are no such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suggest that large-scale plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they have specific desirable characteristics - from those by which their taste or colour improves to such, because of which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders goes through more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since changing conditions through climate change are much worse predicament.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving the genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts, however, that intellectual property engages other breeders because "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "" "" "such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing the public with more material and know-how." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: wait 20 years until a patent expires, certainly not fosters innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the battle already.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders neither have the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "" "" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we can't continue using the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In all, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features: "we don't really create the features themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety breeds his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation it requires a large scale of herbicides, breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "" "" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) have patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the stalemate or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist met.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August 5, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about them.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities sharply criticised this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic network for Human Rights information remains, in spite of this attack and the ridicule of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law of defending the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, leaving in this part of the world and giving victims a voice.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored site of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language issue of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of web site closures. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in the Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpt5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no longer access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles which he writes for inaccessible websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now the blog he set up to bypass the Egyptian government's censorship is the goal of an attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2731">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "blogger who is home to Canada's blog, on the other hand, is still accessible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting about the student protests and taking a video on how the police practised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself to the locking by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the block of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey me the feeling of a state of siege, arrest, attempted murder, unloading at national security council, blocking blogs, and any other web page I was working for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post articles to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after blocking it and that they're afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of vendors by transferring Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the block of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices indicate the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government willing to go out with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day, newspapers in Brazil are reporting with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "Thieves harsh pharmacy with military weapons," "President Timer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air wafee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tight financial situation, the 2017 nonviolence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">The newspaper "Extra" published on 16 August published the editorial "That is not normal," in which she announced to set up a new column called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes happening in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. everything that happens from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes said that this decision was not a cause of pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Inner Security, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse when it is distorted can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harms more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence is a "war." this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historic and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the Federal State of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">To call Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," according to Cecília, "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "" "" "if we look at the Mordrates per federal state, Rio is at No. 16," "" "" "" "she writes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">In particular, Globo, the largest media company in South America, has been emphasizing that, as Cecília stresses, the state's security policy has been repeating for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">The founding of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit established by the Federal State of Rio in 2003, was also part of these security policy measures.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, however, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also causes serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this calls on the state to use means and ways that are typical of war. this includes invading into the territory of a "enemy" where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "misled bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War on or off, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is now a week that the police climbed the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war, many Syrian cities suffer brutal warfare and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the PAX peace organisation and the Syria Institute's research institute, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib are currently in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition proceed on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus, which led to the need for local residents to depend on locally produced food or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through years of blockage, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not part of the traditional dishes planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. their food, however, makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directorate of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and basements." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting fungi, so Dr. Leila becomes Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of approximately 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, 4th September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80%.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government's last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days called a State shower.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also recorded in the region of Galicia in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 explosions that spread to the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June there was a similar tragedy in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite imagery, some 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon area.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can get a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in four districts.</seg>

<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to limit the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral of the Federation of Farmers of Portugal declared the paper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do this nowhere: there are dozens of reports of open streets surrounded by fire.</seg>

<seg id="2851">In addition, building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal on the reform of the forest, which the government had brought to serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objectionable by the local authorities, who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced easing of the law, which permitted the construction activity of case, if the applicant had a means of self-protection - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," adds João Sorval in the same article of the paper Público.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The Quercus environmental organisation draws attention to the fact that large areas of eucalyptus trees, trees made of easily inflammable wood, are spreading, as in a vicious circle, to fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems add to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when inhabitants were looking for information or trying to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they took advantage of their own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and became so crucial at this fateful weekend in October that the servers didn't stand up to the onslaught of the 400,000 users who persecuted the fires: the site counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2876">Even though his mother didn't say it at that time, she knew she wouldn't see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy was to break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick it up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt protected.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his flight, Asharf found herself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was difficult and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wage, and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and trailed sacks with mortars that were heavier than he himself to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran have been shaped by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Ashark recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we covered nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his request for asylum, Ashark came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">For some time, Ashark was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to people in need twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high ratings. however, it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "" "" "the human rights organization Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system" "" "" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 "special reception centres." these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre, if they have officially submitted a request for asylum - which is still possible after the registration of the asylum application for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who do not have money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his innocent livelihood helped Ashark to get rid of these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years in the construction industry, Ashark put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and fast food fast food.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Ashark Baratis's success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to official estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the companies operated by Afghans have sprung up, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Express, in which the waiters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp in Padua. Spice and also behind the Kabulogna pizzeria in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Ashark's goals, however, extend far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade and aim back to the country that he had to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are opportunities," says Ashark with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I never forgot my country and I can't live happily if I know my people are suffering.</seg>

<seg id="2925">Ashark is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques. "they can sell their harvest surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen-Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian Parliament reviews a draft law which foresees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register in order to be able to use social networks within six months of obtaining their full name as well as their ID number within six months.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months "imprisonment or the final slaughter of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was advertised by sixteen members of parliament, is currently in front of the legislative as well as the Parliament's constitutional committee and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in May another member of Parliament submitted a legislative proposal to introduce stricter sanctions for the insult of the president or a senior official." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposed, such an act would be punished with prison and fines, so law experts from the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if the law is passed, this can mean three years" "" "" "" "imprisonment for the convicted." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he exercised robbers against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup who had led to the deportation of elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited for four years in prison for more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May, because the prison management, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, such as weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza spoke two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on pro-Morsi sitting block at Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists hear of leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, which is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia has been heard chiefly into a leaked action plan. said plan stems from the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly backed a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on April 21 on the website of Nawaat, sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia denied the nomination of his sources under Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force users of social media to present their credentials?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In addition, it is stated in the regulations that registration will be necessary with the full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks. it is unclear to now how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to use these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Can we then see ourselves in "WeChat?"</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the state government as an "organizer of information broadening."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services to organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make responsible services responsible for the removal of content and to force them on request to disclose user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include web sites such as Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the wiping Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia maintainers refused to delete two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications reported that the site was closed because it became an information source that cooperates with groups to address a political defamation campaign against Turkey. "</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website. it is thus, in addition to China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain cannot stop to sniff around</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week of leaked documents, the UK government finds itself in the midst of a deliberate consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install covert software that decrypts data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telcos and secret services on the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation still runs until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
