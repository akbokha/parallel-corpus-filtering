this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times rep@@ orter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , cra@@ cks wrote a book in which he found spectac@@ ularly not@@ ing that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally heard of American phones .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally handed over dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if this sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years , the government determined cra@@ cks and called on him to call his alleged sources .
in this train he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists .
according to the First constitutional addition , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they are revealing .
so when the government kno@@ cked on cra@@ cks , he did something that many courage@@ ous rep@@ orters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something exceptional happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although they have been declar@@ ing for years that it was essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the rep@@ orters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of failure and cra@@ cking to make statements , this could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , got home worried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as well as its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit history , and even travel mind@@ set with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and cra@@ cks .
unfortunately , this is just one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers at his accession but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned him more than all the US governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist .
we therefore put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all .
but just as government technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do so from the moment they come into contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that didn &apos;t exist when cra@@ cking had written its book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by Aaron Swar@@ tz , who received from us , and is now further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the here the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , which only has access to the respective news agency .
so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information secretly , and many of the information they would requ@@ esting would not be available from the outs@@ et .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze all of us .
it is important to ensure that not only technology partners such as Edward Snow@@ den have the option of bringing mis@@ deeds to us . it is just as important to protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer ,
who wants to report about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the care of soldiers and reports of crowded hospitals . or the next environmental officer who strikes the alarm for the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data le@@ ak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens have hidden &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were sent from news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers come to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has offices in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a trail of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who are nervous for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do something ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and it affects all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens of a few , are used to hide and obsc@@ ure their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people are very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what is matter .
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US .
presum@@ ably , because there have been no prominent Americans currently occurring in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but due to the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ases work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data dock from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some US states you need less information , need less information to start a company than to get a library card .
this kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off particularly vulnerable species .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator retired as an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked the fact that everyone , right up to a lawyer , made suggestions on how to transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single leader , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability established . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to deal with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very tr@@ ash , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there were always the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see quite well that a lot has started to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have seen advances in transparency concerning the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU det@@ ects in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind firms in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have dra@@ fted a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us firms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story of how I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the boot of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a court sale .
a guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the country . afterwards he would go to the Peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me enth@@ r@@ alled how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a place for sleep ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ä@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I see there ?
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , embarrass@@ ed at the to@@ es at the door , and my bedroom door shut off .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate moves off and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , a mattress and breakfast each morning .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ ette ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I arrived .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make it a business concept .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people out@@ post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors one closes when visiting .
via the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay overnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were waiting for the mis@@ sile to ign@@ ite .
but they did not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children all have learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you are contempl@@ ating the things you can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thumb up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
share your locked mobile phone to your left sitting room@@ mate .
this quiet flight of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most of them feel the responsibility .
thus also most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just this way , who is actually Al Gore &apos;s cell phone ?
could you please tell Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are hot ?
imagine you have 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can really hold out very well @-@ un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to give up your mobile phone ?
for a well @-@ thought @-@ out feedback system , confidence boo@@ sts confidence .
in the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was hard for people to surrender negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest had submitted their assessments before we put them on @-@ line .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they relate to age and place of residence .
not surprisingly , we trust people most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social pre@@ occupation .
it will be exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by assessments .
if you have fewer than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation suff@@ ices simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted loving preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you are revealing .
here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re telling too little , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request will not be accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimum degree of openness , such as &quot; great works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;ll go on holiday with my family . &quot;
how do you manage to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on what topics you should write something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we did not reck@@ on was the great deal of people who were more than willing to disp@@ ose of these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need that had not been met before .
for us , the business is just very good .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who were not allowed to celebrate parties or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I was at the foref@@ ront when trust broke out .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I think only about it .
the dis@@ appointment that one h@@ ears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , a fraction of the 123 million over@@ nights had only one fraction of a problem .
for people rightly trusted one another .
if trust works , wonderful can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want people to feel lonely , they bring books .
they can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay is off .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money trans@@ actions fit together ?
this is an economic trade .
but it is simply not just a &quot; rental industry , &quot; the matter is not fair .
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people place a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if in any place you visit , a group there would wait to fill in a thoroughly and show one in a ta@@ pent@@ our quarter of which you have never heard ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments from the ground up to conver@@ ge ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of shared particip@@ ations ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already begun .
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were convey@@ ed to people whose children were moved out . inc@@ ub@@ ator programs were started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone tonight 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guests with a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality even existed before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did it work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the ingredients of trust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted stere@@ otypes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find that amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes by me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder what we are able to use for in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ rot @-@ fitness fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I am a practi@@ sing , spiritual Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born that way .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I made the decision to ou@@ te me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : back then it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , in comparison with the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ re@@ achable beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have struggl@@ ed with the Quran .
I read it , thought , posed , dou@@ b@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devot@@ ion deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands you , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that horri@@ ble morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked out on the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
is there a technical fault ?
my shock turned into indig@@ nation swi@@ ft@@ ly .
why should you do such a thing ?
I switched to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... , ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , &quot; ... &quot; Middle Eastern descent &quot; ... , ... &quot; D@@ ji@@ had &quot; ... , ... &quot; is bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me into a susp@@ icious citizen .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start studying .
I remember seeing myself -- when we were silent -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was afraid the first time to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations , said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; ble@@ ed in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be afraid . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that were thought to be Muslims in the open and sm@@ ashed .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the people who attacked this country attacked our country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have put on the terrorists &quot; anger on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain oneself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they talk about my church like a tumor in the USA &apos;s body .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less , because the question is false .
Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumour in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are the invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but not to stop terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant view of people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a head of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the process of radic@@ alisation , one has found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts may make a bra@@ in@@ washing that causes the terrorists to be the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we have to stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , just like the K@@ u Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when you take a look at them , they do not attract what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . any cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke , sil@@ enced them and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to their anger , it was a main objective of the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts that promised them a solution .
this Ima@@ m re @-@ established the connection with God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their fur@@ y , he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family are concerned .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ it@@ arian government system , con@@ formity , and pre@@ ju@@ dice .
one study shows that if you submit messages reported neg@@ atively about Muslims , they are more likely to agree on military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just a academic problem .
when you see when the mood against Muslims came up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror as I expected .
in fact , it can be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has sensible and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
the assignment of collective inno@@ c@@ ence is not only about declar@@ ing themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple , who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who visited him in the afternoon .
he shot himself eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or stayed at home safely ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely .
we op@@ ted for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we ro@@ de in silence , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went into the hall , and what I saw , let me hold on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come , not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I &apos;m collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had pre@@ clu@@ ded courage and compassion and pre@@ ju@@ dice .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than ours .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with a drau@@ ght , working in a noble mind@@ set , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be dec@@ eived . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people seem like an exception to the rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion @-@ dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones .
before air par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase enters into our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by inter@@ connecting flight devices , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
you can also build self @-@ locking structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know collec@@ tively , where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , to determine what the machine should do .
external commands can be executed on the highest level e. g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying machine trying to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and thus has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a swe@@ eping side .
a restriction of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that no matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often face fundamental abstract questions which advance to the heart of the matter .
such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known for example as machines with a thousand moving parts coming together to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled flying machines , which had only two movable parts : one propeller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one thing works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote @-@ operated flying machine .
it has only one moving part , a propeller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one propeller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , there is a lot happening in the inner life so that it can fly stable and move around in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to t@@ oss it right .
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of throwing it right when all is watching is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ Head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is large and symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
in doing so , he gets the extraordinary ability to do so ,
move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight Prop@@ ellers .
a lot is possible in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at that .
if flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong - an engine or propeller drops , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , if restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making half of the fli@@ ght@@ less fli@@ ght@@ less .
the final demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic waste heat .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a p@@ allet of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there wants to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for guys like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to shape it in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
at 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cled each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , so the mass of three suns returned to pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment they lit bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies throughout the universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
their energy did not set them free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events in a timely manner .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , there was a multi @-@ cell life on Earth .
since then the earth has produced some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stand at us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of especially courage@@ ous -- Ra@@ i Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ di@@ ating black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational wave observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be considerably increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
this is why it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o started a final trial to solve some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes scre@@ wed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the f@@ arewell of my sick father .
in essence , it was the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been exam@@ ining gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes for 23 years and their through observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a stimul@@ us in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and hal@@ ted into the other .
for illu@@ stra@@ tive purposes , teachers in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often perform a really al@@ ber@@ nating dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and qu@@ en@@ ched at the meeting of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is to say 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . therefore , the lig@@ o @-@ workers declared ins@@ ane .
with a five kilomet@@ re long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured to less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the chase after the waves : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are inv@@ entive and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile .
this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points .
in the case of killing , it &apos;s different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
for example , the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain properties such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to focus on the story behind it .
&quot; now speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; thank you Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by looking at changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies lie within the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been working for quite a long time .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies turn very fast , you can hear the same pen with an additional key change . this sounds like the wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@
it is a type of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- somebody who knows what he has to hear , knows this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
in this lies the remaining meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens a completely new way to explore the universe , as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can not see -- practically or basically -- not .
a Super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of them we learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical occur@@ ren@@ ces happen in the nucle@@ us , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through , as these are opaque .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves pier@@ ce iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it as the Big B@@ ang is obsc@@ ured by its own after@@ g@@ low .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , which we have never seen and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first few things that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o it watches , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are , so to speak , the din@@ osau@@ rs for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o makes us a completely different point of view of what happened in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
with Lig@@ o we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories in the world and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter whether it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say yes .
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
do I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of was rid of my fear .
my fear of talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes , &quot; I changed .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply to an un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my smallest ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from then on I s@@ wore to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say for playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , catch you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created television . I produce television .
I make TV , in a big style .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days by four shows , thus every nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three programmes simultaneously in production , at the same time four , 16 epis@@ odes : sc@@ andal , 15 epis@@ odes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 epis@@ odes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 Hours Television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series run on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts I have created myself and not only produced , so even above . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who else is doing that ?
no one , so I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you are running a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I talk about work , so that you understand that I &apos;m not just lying around the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it is not about dre@@ aming with a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I go into work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as though I set up troops , as I painted on a screen .
as a result , one has a high tone , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting , ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on it forever .
many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I &apos;m writing about writing that writing is a pleasure for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the sums -- when I started to work and work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this hum@@ ming , this energy .
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
hum@@ ming is music . hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such sums , then you can no longer strive for size .
the feeling not to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sums .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ a@@ holic .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
maybe it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know only that I am not made for failure , and I know only that I love the bu@@ zz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one clear : the more successful I become , the more epis@@ odes , the more epis@@ odes , the more super@@ posed boundaries , the more work there are , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations are there .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land which I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high clay , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the sums . I am the sums .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
revised , over@@ stressed , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single stit@@ ch .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimate , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz@@ ing ceased .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work any more . the engine was off .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing didn &apos;t come back .
my bu@@ zz@@ ing was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no regret , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan doesn &apos;t sleep , doesn &apos;t give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect titanium .
I was a show@@ piece Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz@@ ing I was .
so what do you do when what you do , the work you love suddenly f@@ ade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ w you , stupid author @-@ tit@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do , you do , you love what you are doing , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill G@@ ates , you just love another and that gives you a hum@@ ming when you knew the bu@@ zz when the bu@@ zz is stopping , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; south @-@ state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presents me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I will say no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when two things are made clear to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , I must say Yes to all and second , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; estimate . &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; estim@@ ating . &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and I smoke my bu@@ zz@@ ing , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ m , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of sum@@ ming , I can do nothing except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and dam@@ p kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it goes on , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something inside me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is slowly coming back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sums , but a bu@@ zz@@ ing .
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the amount of work , the titanium dioxide , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how func@@ tionally my brain is , then I forgot what the real hum@@ ming is .
sum@@ ming is not a force and it is not working @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is the stream that comes from the z@@ est of life .
real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for what God told me that I am a Titan ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic from any debt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the bu@@ zz again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not as good as working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what kind of person would prefer to be a home ?
well , yes , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is not one of them .
we rush around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly stiff , absent , and confused .
I always look for my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it too ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream woman .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you also know why ? you &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie replaces me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and talking my te@@ ens for a whole 15 minutes with me , I am Mother of the Year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just 15 minutes , you don &apos;t need more .
everyone can get 15 minutes a day , even on a bad day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to be@@ g .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my feel @-@ good , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming of having a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play &quot; games &quot; in general .
allow yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I go and win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got a Titan in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a day , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my h@@ um .
the sum@@ ming of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
the sum@@ ming of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it &apos;s sn@@ app@@ y to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan playing trip to Jerusalem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said Yes to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire still burns .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I create , the marathon I run , the troops , the screens , the sum@@ ming , the sum@@ ming , the other , the right sums : the sums of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of life in me spreads . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I catch you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
it is very fru@@ str@@ ating for us neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons that the brain , in contrast to other body organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical techniques .
they certainly have heard of one of the most well known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; thereby one electro@@ de is im@@ planted deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neurolog@@ ical function improves .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked in the emergency room day and night .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that the brain swell@@ s and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save life , you have to reduce the pressure of the skull .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right nutrition , temperature , humidity and the surroundings in order to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to do so .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you know from biology lessons that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Double@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ um cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so certain .
one thing is clear , however -- of these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in colour to be able to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we moved them to the origin of the same individual .
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we spread these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we have the same cells rei@@ m@@ pled in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we made an injury and stimul@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been stimul@@ ated .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we used in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey recover from a brain injury ?
so , we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets from one tablet .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable skill level , we hurt the motor skills range in the motor Cort@@ ex .
after that the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen to people , they spontane@@ ously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left , they see the monkey who spontane@@ ously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before inf@@ rin@@ gement .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
see now , when we planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the rice plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us as well .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant them in humans .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill approximately two kil@@ ograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes to reach the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
first of all , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
first , it is necessary to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about this .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable en@@ for@@ cements .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew of Singapore and his great copy@@ rights in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
democracy is actually waning with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was clari@@ fied as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my nasty friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economical model for a true democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , China &apos;s Communist Party , and even the Euro@@ group of a mis@@ belief , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are bl@@ amed , our future is dark and our great new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin peaks par@@ adox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognise the debt mountain ,
but few recognize its twin .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the wealthy econom@@ ists and corporations , which are too anxi@@ ous to invest there where it would be productive and income , with which one could bear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 tril@@ lion US dollars were invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all wealth producing goods such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.4 tril@@ lion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.@@ 1 tril@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that are not compens@@ ated by the common market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the United States , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand , which , as in an endless loop , advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which would be true that his son would kill him if he grew up ,
un@@ inten@@ tionally bring about the circumstances leading to the k@@ ills of the body .
this is my Ha@@ wing with Capit@@ alism --
all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially fund all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but before we continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do we mean under democracy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
but it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclusi@@ ons .
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same vote weigh@@ ting in questions of the state concerns .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted for a long time --
like a candle lit very bright , it is burned out quickly .
however , our liberal democra@@ cies have not roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy first arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone .
in our modern democra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , while the economy gradually mig@@ rates to politics and def@@ ends them .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government , and yet not in power , because the power of politics is separated into the economy and the divisions are separated .
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a flock of pre@@ dat@@ ors that so last@@ ingly dec@@ im@@ ated the animals that it feeds on , that they end up star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized policy so far that it har@@ ms itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is increasing , political goods are de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality rises , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too fri@@ ghtened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; re@@ tains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens by a miracle , without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and wast@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness .
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism is doing it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the t@@ wins higher , the wast@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness of sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , just as it -- very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
we must therefore re @-@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democra@@ ti@@ ze the re @-@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ car which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear as a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; or something similar to that of society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve human beings and people can put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks about the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it look like , how could it look like having this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; like D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples briefly .
in the area of the company : please imagine a capital market where you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and from rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ taken .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but which the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no re@@ aring twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please ensure that our national currencies have a freely floating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all of humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ ated in which it pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in our hands and we do it better democratic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is in the ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in the macro@@ economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant ,
like Hay@@ ek , for this reason I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am fully mad .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you are not confused , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : it &apos;s a very gre@@ ek , kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you made very clear what you think from the West &apos;s point of view to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our liberal democra@@ cies , we have the impression of democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in some ways , if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was especially scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what we can observe now in China resembles the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to blame China now to do what the West itself did in the 19th century sm@@ ells viol@@ ently for hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Treas@@ ury Secretary at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sens@@ ed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece but the euro@@ zone ,
for us to say good@@ bye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the ongoing den@@ ial that a massive ad policy went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the entire European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have chosen the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , you might delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead of ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a minister of finance , or any minister , who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he claims he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders &quot; side to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that run through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they have been implementing a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Tro@@ ika who imposed this policy on us conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ oss@@ al error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if it does not survive , the released fighters will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we allow ourselves to hit the road of a post @-@ modern 1930 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what it seems to me , it will also be well toler@@ ated for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we sincer@@ ely hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , many thanks for you were at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most of you have never heard of Roy Price , although he probably is responsible for 22 medium minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is Managing Director at Amazon Studios ,
the Amazon TV production company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ gehog and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website , IMDB . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating is received .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive , where after you have watched a season your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these epis@@ odes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price is not concerned about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to prohi@@ bit &apos; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &apos; .
he makes more thoughts about the average exc@@ itation , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it &apos;s also the first time that Amazon is doing something like that , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
it requires guaranteed success , so it keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight Candi@@ dates for TV Shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch them for free .
and if Amazon disc@@ erns things for nothing , do you get too , right ?
millions of spectators are watching these epis@@ odes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p over or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process it , and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four rep@@ ubli@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always searching for a super @-@ show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of hosting a competition , he and his team have looked at the available data on Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers what actors .
when they had all the pieces together they went into a car and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve .
now the question is : what happened here ?
there are two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this about ?
because logic somehow says that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as a Back @-@ Up .
you optimize it by very powerful computers .
the minimum thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work so , this is a bit terri@@ fying because we live in a time in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room . if you come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dism@@ iss@@ al occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most accomplished firms are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that they can predict out@@ breaks of influ@@ enza , the bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news station . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature .
it worked just fine , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flows increasingly into decisions of life -- at work , in legal enforcement , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very intelligent people can use many data in@@ concei@@ v@@ ably to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years , I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its single parts , so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second , you put the parts together to create a resolution .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the pieces again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is to put parts and pieces together again even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I believe Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts , put together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they had a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions first when they compete for TV ideas , then chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order to not forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ ap or No question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will challenge it later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard in hin@@ d@@ sight of the ball .
but , as you naturally know when you have the data available , you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball is smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data , it is still paying off to make decisions , be an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
