Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish institution where young people are to meet today .
a chapel , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tun@@ n@@ eling tunnel .
small farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official card Munich is promoting exciting stories for days .
it is anno@@ ying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows who had to get upset because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bayern of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but precisely for that reason very revealing .
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how towns and communities in the area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ering carpet , which one does not recognize as such .
in the big overview map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called primary @-@ position papers , were incorporated for towns and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bavarian survey administration between 18@@ 10 and 1864 , and the first sur@@ veying of Bavaria was born .
your client : Napoleon .
the French Army commander occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops re@@ treated with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bayern card .
Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph pushed the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying business .
the original work sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all the others on the Bavarian State Library &apos;s website .
the comparison of Early / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is the send@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the 18@@ 56 map .
S@@ end@@ ling became 21 years after the creation of the map , so 1877 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , there is S@@ send@@ ling in the middle of the city .
the houses were built around 18@@ 56 along the present @-@ day Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser only in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered flags of the so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; from which the property tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small plots do not show farmers there anymore - but small farmers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land in the sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of S@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the October test , was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; on Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the hill &quot; Auf der Lü@@ nen , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once locked people with ma@@ dness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was the Munich @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ splatz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den led the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended up ques@@ tioning the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also prohibited the staff to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , director of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point , too , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ zer anstalt in 1905 .
the Is@@ ar Amp@@ er Hospital Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist , has been there since 2006 .
young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um on the grounds of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
West is the football field of the T@@ SV München Ost , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected - architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ splatz , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ bing ra@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English institute , small business buildings and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn tri@@ bal route takes place .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill up the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group publi@@ ci@@ zes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Union for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , requires af@@ ro @-@ amer@@ ican travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special attention when traveling through the state , as a number of du@@ bi@@ ous , ra@@ cial incidents l@@ ately occur throughout the country and can be noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recent Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , and the State prosec@@ uting authorities , disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ately target@@ ing minorities , promp@@ ted the group to issue the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that people pass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the USA .
the group quoted ap@@ ologies such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more gasoline during the voyage and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being charged with a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s Office of At@@ tor@@ ney General , showing that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; people must be willing to take care of che@@ wing money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos;s hate crime report program , which ranks the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had passed immigration laws , committed local law enforcement agencies to arrest people due to immigration violations , which will contribute to the further ra@@ cial profile according to the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US .
electric fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ zau@@ n project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U members Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac gave a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U town association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met at the pi@@ voting cemetery of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted first insight into his farm in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 cows and also many k@@ itt@@ ens supplied and accommod@@ ated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; is the alternative marketing route for him for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste only regional .
since he is also the BL@@ M chairman of Fisch@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; elementary important . &quot;
I cannot generate profit on such steep areas .
the green surface ensures a lot of work , a lot has to be done with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he had no bio@@ operation .
for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the significance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader @-@ promotion . &quot;
farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per h@@ ect@@ are .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could be dra@@ fted for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they will continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised for funding
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants .
the open @-@ plan area is therefore 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 2023 .
half of the total cost of € 71 500 was promoted by leaders , one quarter contributed to the commun@@ e of Fisch@@ bach .
thus , the farmers remained 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of pasture fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and ma@@ iden@@ s it is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter White also stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the county gui@@ del@@ ine ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state support of wheat f@@ ences .
the goal is to open the Black Forest .
the prerequis@@ ite is the presence of a convey@@ ance marked by the L@@ PR .
moreover , the area to be f@@ enced must not be sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway for the fisher@@ man &apos;s electric fence project in 2018 .
the accounting area is equal to 35 hectares , and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ m square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals to dras@@ tically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ ating owners and liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have du@@ red him if he had done it .
but he took their importance , and in particular the importance attributed to her , as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that en@@ ligh@@ tens the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to , which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Miller is really right , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the contemporary resonance of Laz@@ arus &apos;s crum@@ bling words , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ar@@ iness , your poor , / your crowded masses , who desire to breathe freely , / the el@@ event@@ h waste of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; iling Wa@@ ste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ ump@@ pumps USA .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confron@@ tation : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who sat down to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political act .
the sculpture was intended to show connections between French and American rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical depic@@ tion .
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American nav@@ el .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change it for a long time from the right wing .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conservative to bring the American flame into the re@@ claimed world : &quot; Lady Liberty is progres@@ sing .
it is said to bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch should not light the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is rather unusual here on something .
the importance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible travels on the de@@ cks of ships .
in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to acknowledge .
their tor@@ ch should not light the way , but hate hatred , which is their sole source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the British team .
the performance director of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which ki@@ cks off on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland there is something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest .
their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h made quite naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete with the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les at their fifth world championships , says it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes in the world championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ range runner Mu@@ ir leads on this road and last year has set up five British and two European records .
it will take part at 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which one should watch after a great season , which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only Scot@@ sman in the Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell team .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enor@@ mously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in medals and fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ate colleagues voted for me and chose me , makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to Po@@ dium .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home championship .
so it is really important to set on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking Cri@@ tics via Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the citizens of vot@@ ers
the father of our country knew something about bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers proposed him for all , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he p@@ am@@ pered with criticism , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union en@@ su@@ ed it at the beginning of this week .
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dism@@ issed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type such as H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his vot@@ ers and play his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
that is why the blocking of people who come to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is called official and paid by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , spokesperson Ques@@ tion@@ in Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people who sw@@ ank the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke to some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people speaking with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and non @-@ prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same issue , then they are regarded by some rather than a collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor expressed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical le@@ aks and to arrest and silence prot@@ esters .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones on this issue was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County declared the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U due to his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writers struck on his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critic@@ ised his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , over@@ powered his ministry , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true guidance means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for home comfort over the next three days , as the ren@@ aissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led in the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from his best side , he &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job as he fixed this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here to win .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to his home ground .
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how this has happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung canc@@ ers due to passive smoking
over the past two decades , fewer people have died due to passive smoking of lung cancer .
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) will come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .
back then there were 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; said the director of the court Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which is constantly ham@@ pered by construction work , represents a major problem for the construction staff of St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and barri@@ c@@ ades is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are entitled to transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian gold country
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cooked dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai rule in the un@@ quiet Indones@@ ian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ coal tu@@ ber is taken with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example to wash clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned any fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work late : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement revol@@ ving against the independence of the Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal guar@@ dians .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea comprised the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as seclu@@ ded as it is o@@ ily . the journey involves a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ira and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there are no public means of transport .
the city , with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants , consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences and from cor@@ rug@@ ated roofs , which have been converted into different yellow tones by r@@ ust .
only very few Indones@@ ian have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans ad@@ ored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to have only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an in Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort de@@ min@@ ated gold and copper valued at 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources valued at an estimated US $ 78 billion .
however , these riches are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preser@@ ves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid almost $ 20 million to local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in one officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ ua demands for greater autonomy are threatening these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tort@@ ured and imprisoned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 .
according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission , mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tri@@ bal stron@@ gh@@ old in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we commerci@@ alize all . &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year are contained , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week incidents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws have strengthened , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a flow of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is at 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell roasted chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai natives who went to work in the province capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ov@@ i , promised to address the ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Pap@@ ua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann assured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua a little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , only two months after Jok@@ ov &apos;s initi@@ ation , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point in October .
on December 7th , 2014 was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took a cl@@ ash on their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , hun@@ ted and hit the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the or@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle continuously and im@@ it@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters started hur@@ ling stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIME that was not shared by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat of danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around I suddenly fired into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TIME on the por@@ ch of his painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin was the witness of shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was there , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , like many In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans , bears only one name , the TIME in glo@@ omy atmosphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said that his officers preferred to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta the following day .
three weeks ago , Jok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura where he expressed sympathy with the families of the victims and vo@@ wed to address the historic gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Security Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &quot; s and the beginning of the 2000 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must pass through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to Jak@@ arta with TIME on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wir@@ anto , whom the UN has indic@@ ted for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been settled in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fier@@ y un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the dead , the military searched for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ots have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( in@@ dones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we were afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; said the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded were quickly delivered here , such TIME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself in my house two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called on to account for the officers involved and withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an in@@ ru@@ h@@ eh@@ ran for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( OP@@ M ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by spur@@ ring spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top OP@@ M leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily det@@ ained in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
the rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to be able to process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown which have arrived at a larger number since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ira .
the few jobs that exist in the region tend to go to the better educated and weal@@ th@@ ier migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own enterprises competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tri@@ bal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were dep@@ orted from Pap@@ ua for lack of coordination with related institutions , although the rare permission to film was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov &apos;s election campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , Mar@@ sh@@ al Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to examine the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sho@@ ot .
the same countries have historically seen the OP@@ M supported .
the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; there is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia will have another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tri@@ bal stock .
he wants Jok@@ o@@ ak@@ ov@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation , the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai fire victims carried out a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of an victim was buried in a compound opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire cap@@ tures the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 metre tall , 79 @-@ floor building .
it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the cry of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said the fire fighting units against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished fire and cooled the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said that it is working on providing accommodation for those affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident can revi@@ ve questions on the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damages came from facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in Britain the police said that the system of plates for isolation and covering at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has passed through with his great Davis Cup coup at the Annual General Meeting .
at the session in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the revolutionary suggestion for this sport to play Davis Cup single only on two winning rates was not spar@@ sely supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , but even so much appreciated five set classics , the traditional rate is preserved .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore missed only margin@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the applications .
not until the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal had already come to the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup fin@@ alists will be the host right in the first round in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers are carrying forbidden items into the aircraft , finding a survey
a survey conducted among passengers showed that more than 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally bore forbidden kni@@ ves or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they had bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they were mistakenly powered by fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out with more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet @-@ charter service , Strat@@ os Jet Charter Inc. - also noted that younger travellers would rather ignore the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who admitted that they unk@@ now@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent who were members of the generation X .
the most common objects that were deliberately pushed past T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent agreed to have worn kno@@ w@@ ingly items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many mistakenly sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed goods had brought through airport security and how many had done it inten@@ tionally .
it is no surprise that people who most likely sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed goods - kno@@ w@@ ingly or unk@@ now@@ ingly - carry through the safety of those who most frequently fly .
however , the company pointed out that the T@@ SA directives are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain what fluids they are allowed to take or how much of them .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could look at books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
electric jack El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
he has so far under@@ scored that a portion of the customers has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever more tri@@ ump@@ y figures to increase sales and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time revealed another , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins .
now Mus@@ k is giving up : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ positions , 6@@ 3,000 have already been with@@ drawn .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is only non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay 1000 Euros ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; back completely .
at present , 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations occurred , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could be solved .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side .
Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles last year .
in 2018 , all models should be merged - 500@@ ,000 will be , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obviously there .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never @-@ tested production lines without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , if it comes to greater delays , the liability of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in dro@@ ves .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt with@@ draws due to the delay in the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after he had been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environment Protection Agency , res@@ igned his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ induced air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be respon@@ sive to the needs of state @-@ owned environmental agencies compared to previous administ@@ rations .
he did not mention the complaint lo@@ dged against his previous position in a Federal Court of App@@ eals .
the deadline was 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone governance .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will be hes@@ it@@ ating for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; getting involved in local decisions or ham@@ per@@ ing economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ rel@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regul@@ ating or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the section regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of App@@ eals in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , which obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane le@@ aks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al in O@@ zone standards would simply rein@@ force the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfil@@ l@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; under former administ@@ rations , the EPA has often not adher@@ ed to the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waiting to be prosec@@ uted by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who de@@ pl@@ ored the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial procedures , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that at some point P@@ ru@@ itt will use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the O@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York general prosec@@ utor Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States , who compl@@ ained EPA of this week , said the group intends to maintain statutory pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important gain for health and safety from these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , New York included California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Ma@@ ine , Massachus@@ etts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont , Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone is created when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources respond in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contributing to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered about the unexpected change of course .
&quot; it is wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from those responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to fight against environmental pollution and its special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tum@@ ors Celeb@@ rates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius &apos; Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 pm is invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of Tum@@ arc a concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Martini stresses : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer prototype . &quot; Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the Berg with the rec@@ tory church to Tum@@ lingen together with the V@@ og@@ t@@ ei &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the document of the deed , beside the former parish church , besides the former parish church , there was also a magnificent courtyard , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ ate was owned and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the beautiful settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
ancient maps dating back to 1600 under@@ score these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age originated from the early medieval church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , buried and filled with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
associated with this was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ ater of the two cr@@ ush on Christmas in 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were inserted and the bell pieces were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aky .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church @-@ bases and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church were threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing imp@@ ellers .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was broken off .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 , a storm broke the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was ab@@ orted .
only the present tower @-@ wer@@ g was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ em care about the &quot; creative reti@@ re@@ es &quot; as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius facility .
as a promot@@ er , the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ arc invite on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the Combo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with speeches by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &apos;s location speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
to the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade , a pot@@ ion takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers present the fantastic view .
the ser@@ en@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is important for tum@@ bling and radio silence .
the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ nen are particularly committed to home care , such as the ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Martini .
association wants to appro@@ ve approval of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ ars &quot; does not fores@@ ee any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or .
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ ars &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentration zone exists at the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy usage for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such zones will prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind @-@ force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days before , but the district government of Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a formation fault .
&quot; due to the lack of planning law , the approved permit is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to take back , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the current state of affairs : before the summer break the city council once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this marks the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines systematically excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been made in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes her to the occasion to check the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to agree on the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four each 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of some 11,@@ 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to about a fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sens city council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district .

city and De@@ aler plan &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region are expected to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the city administration intend to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to enti@@ ce residents to shopping in the city centre .
as the Chairman of the Gewerbe@@ verein , Christian König , announced , the &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend should make the customers sensi@@ ti@@ ze what offers their own city is beyond the usual supermarket commodity .
according to this , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their apprentices@@ hips .
in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot;
the aim of this promotion is not only to residents of the city and the region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , so Christian König .
municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this means that the business association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive Centre . &quot;
this includes new offerings , such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well ten@@ fest and selling Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts to move them into active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and wai@@ ver on parking fees on this day are also part of the concept .
in addition , customer potenti@@ als are to be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also lost sight of downtown when shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city center - to land@@ lords , businesses of the whole city and associations .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that had spread partly , had said to the king in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , Head of the Chamber of Commerce in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; Day , the first five Thur@@ ing@@ ian towns to take part in Germany .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mm@@ er@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his buying behaviour himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two dead and several wounded after explosion at U.S. school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .

tr@@ ump placed after le@@ aked tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US president imp@@ lied him because he publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . report@@ edly , he said to him : &quot; you can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and vo@@ wed to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who mig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p , &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call , after saying Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;

a 1948 @-@ old Ford Mercury sail@@ ed through a group of spectators in the rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ obs - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train on his c@@ ig@@ ar and g@@ lan@@ ced through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ ward , the in@@ mates were ho@@ vering in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
Schrei@@ e tore the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a reproduction .
but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost everyone in the audience really ki@@ cked off very real si@@ gh .
since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to mim@@ ic the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were f@@ ished by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was charged with murder .
&quot; it is really incredible that during all these years there was no single person arrested - even though we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps in the organisation of post@@ production .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil @-@ rights activ@@ ist .
for him , it serves as a dramatic appeal to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that a injustice was never corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to stop , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician puts a blanket on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ching on July 27 , 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but none of them was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects have been on the open for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch action throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time at the pres@@ election campaign in summer .
approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ oned according to the F@@ BI of the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that rum@@ or was in the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they got away from prison and approached Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b ring@@ ed the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes a F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy involving the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and fal@@ si@@ fied the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ oks form@@ ulates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a campaign law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is illu@@ stra@@ tive , po@@ ign@@ ant and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believe that he no longer exists in America .
it is hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with its u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or listen to what I &apos;ve done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of black - crowded into a room and listened as gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed review of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of the boss @-@ cl@@ an member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors played Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the high priest cri@@ es out and pus@@ hes him angr@@ ily that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , he , win@@ ch from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
As@@ cona re@@ jects the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out laugh@@ ing .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ ing lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ u@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people at the time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors wit@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ionship replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time when Raz@@ oli says the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
there are cri@@ es , shots , and then silence .
a woman cloth@@ ed with grief , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and introduces Bil@@ lie Holidays confi@@ d@@ ant lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers wi@@ pes out sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is divided between black and white .
a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only down the street .
they all experienced Georgi@@ an impressive humidity for nearly eight hours when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the bur@@ ial places of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the ly@@ n@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels g@@ ho@@ stly .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene loads the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children ho@@ ck at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ ope and wi@@ pe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the cl@@ an member has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his te@@ amm@@ ers and then breaks down in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience is sitting together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair chat@@ ters from Atlanta talks about the im@@ position with a black pair they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky struggl@@ ed to find words , which feeling the performance left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like yourself and do it because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the Police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks is sitting at his table in the same room , eating and remin@@ ding citizen &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he started to plan the performance next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ position is inspiring in a way because it describes the horror of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans to Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colourful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging of a gigantic six @-@ storey backdrop .
the rotating stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar DEN@@ IC ) optionally shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with a bri@@ ck@@ work and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ stan@@ e &quot; logo from the G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
in front of it an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhein@@ eys pos@@ ing as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - which takes place through his &quot; Ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ sons - sung by Stephan@@ ie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
K@@ ess mis@@ ses Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , r@@ ins@@ ing into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and giving the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen , who surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he hits Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) also has to believe it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with a strong appl@@ ause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski , who humble themselves and de@@ fle@@ ct the hands of Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , can be celebrated stor@@ my .
there is great appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in light of the great heat back in casual wear .
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
in 2013 he had to have a rolling pipe concert in 2013 , and five years later , there was a great jubil@@ ee in which the scattered &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls were interrupted .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; one not@@ ices that the audience with the &quot; Ring &quot; has somehow grown together in a way , &quot; had said it briefly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of its perspective .
I prefer a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max A@@ mount works as volunteer
they work at several locations in their voluntary year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I worked at school in the open day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum that I see here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are now 26 years , a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does this come about ?
quantity : I made a high school .
and then a civil engineer studying , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
for me , I realized that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe also , really .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunte@@ ering service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it depends on where to do his FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon supervision .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
unlike in civil engineering studies ?
of course , it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating extras here .
there are always other people who have a different story behind each other .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , has been taken out of the family - one must always respond to it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and short@@ ens the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut off its divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
job cuts , the Director General John Fall@@ on , mainly announced at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , is in addition to his previous restructuring , where already 4,000 points were lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( US $ 3@@ 94 million ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was taken by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month expressed its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after it achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul &apos;s con@@ vo@@ i attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ b@@ ings
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a soldier of Nato and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured , NATO announced .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan has taken this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul .
in a statement of NATO , it is said that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ sives . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated at the US military hospital on the air@@ field of Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the T@@ ali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the T@@ ali@@ ban said they had carried out this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the most le@@ thal milit@@ ant attack in the country since the U.S. led forces th@@ ron@@ ged the T@@ ali@@ ban from power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as US president Donald Tr@@ ump is weighing up the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings of Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and , in particular , the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay a regulation by the Obama administration , which states that states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this happened one day after 15 countries accused the agency because of the step .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday to push ahead with the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 , &quot; and said that it shows the obligation of the Agency to cooperate with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to measure the o@@ zone provisions - in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the Colombia district , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental concerns imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that is supposed to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of demo@@ crats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of major emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EPA website states that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma .
community wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Tor@@ u@@ ń @-@ win@@ eg@@ ro@@ ls decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing land part is signed , reported mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although it will still take time until the church community has so far been in the community ownership , there is now no planning package for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor he would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Council of Comm@@ unities sets out to see such a common space not as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ righteous housing , but openly into the church .
for example , the word &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision which has been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget in autumn is due to funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common space would be , as reported T@@ j@@ aden , capable of handling 60 percent of 30 percent .
the Commission &apos;s proposal looks to signal the investor that in this respect he doesn &apos;t want to throw a ni@@ pple between the legs , stating that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding structure - as well as the pitch roof - which reduces the height of the tr@@ ash and makes the construction more economical - may be possible .
need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer doesn &apos;t mean that he is this addi@@ tive .
when it helps : the body is unanim@@ ous .
it is not as simple as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela Ruf points to the many of its own buildings , with which one does not get so much forward , but now you rest in the community room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely addressing the community space - but absolutely against a community participation .
it sees behind it a conce@@ aled subsi@@ dy in any already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but will receive a real exchange value in case of doubt , the counter@@ speech .
three pro@@ pon@@ ents find the motion to submit the proposal accordingly .
this is the case with two opposing voices in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller conclu@@ des : &quot; if we take the decision , we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and seriously injured .
as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from Hil@@ den coming from Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driving in the same direction gave him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving on the road , he apparently did not notice the on@@ coming traffic .
he met with a car that contributed a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was flung down on the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a retin@@ ue carriage .
FC Bayern Munich has to ren@@ ounce the Super Cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with personnel , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven pro@@ s are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the personnel management of the German football record champion Bayern München is getting bigger at cup winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also use the BV@@ B to do without David Al@@ aba .
the Italian confirmed this on Friday .
in addition , the Mun@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neuer , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats over the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti has the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not good at last . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intensive play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into their spell .
the game was sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
mig@@ rate from star to star
in the resin , the country &apos;s first &quot; star path &quot; is to emerge .
the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg is planning this .
a planetary path exists in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star trail &quot; is coming to meet the need for information of many har@@ z@@ ers .
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic achievement .
the members want to place tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
in a first phase by 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well at@@ tain@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
In@@ quiry box@@ men St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets should be supple@@ mented by internet .
for this reason , a good mobile network welcome plays a role in selecting a location .
accessibility was also a criteri@@ on .
later , the Train Ticket to Ride is to be extended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewer experiences a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star stronger than another , even though it was much further away .
it is also possible to see in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , in the university town , there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary route at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium Göttingen since 2003 .
beginning before Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path with its stel@@ ae leads up to Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to - de@@ mot@@ ed to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth is shr@@ inking so to a sco@@ op of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exact height of the sun is 70 centi@@ meters away .
the entire distance of the planet is a good four kilometres .
while the light from Sun to Plu@@ to requires approximately eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the plug with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the cos@@ mos .
the march to the next fixed star , however , would take half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a coll@@ ision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 lbs , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Boxing Council Light@@ weight champion , went down the cor@@ ridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Boxing Organisation Super @-@ Feder@@ ated Champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ Di@@ visions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What is your champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Sar@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the pair pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ ac@@ enko &apos;s manager , Eg@@ is Klim@@ as , noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect scale . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have asc@@ ended to bronze &#91; in 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to get down at light weight .
and he has to move on lightweight boards &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
the fans demand that .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agre@@ es .
&quot; boxes need this fight . &quot;
Klim@@ as asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound dé@@ but this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia in the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their Light@@ weight title fight in the Forum on September 23rd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he may possibly participate in his Saturday fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko thought of the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the Tri@@ athlon champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to co @-@ stop . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show stro@@ kes , then boxing .
both said they could sense the momentum created for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ac@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top comb@@ at@@ ants , and that is Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire burst
in an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control of his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock shortly before the end of the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he over@@ turned and then lying on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then traffic could be esc@@ orted to the accident site on the left lane .
Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; three chain works better &quot;
after the 2 : 2 , Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the start of the season against Braunschweig that optim@@ ising the def@@ ensive formation in Au@@ e scored points .
with the first season of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy , with the result , there would not have been the two ad@@ versaries at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opposite doors too much , and we have to fit better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three chain should also be further optimized .
and a gate after a fre@@ ak won &apos;t catch the run@@ es any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future there will be no one else besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will work better after the experience in preparing with the three @-@ chain as with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; said his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we have just in the three chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build good , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequis@@ ite is , however , that we are still better in harmony and we cannot afford as many distra@@ ctions in the building process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann will also go to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak after a draw from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are at four points on Sunday and can focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted nothing of this .
&quot; I only judged the start of the season after six to eight days of playing , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Lie@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Sax@@ onia in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be ab@@ orted pre@@ mat@@ urely because of an accident .
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an asc@@ ension favourite in the bones .
&quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 % where they are at the moment , &quot; says the inner def@@ ender of Fort@@ una .
although guests from the Rhin@@ eland are a little favourite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we can swe@@ ep them away just because we are entitled to come under the first six , is non@@ sense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games .
&quot; there is no squ@@ ad in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat in advance , &quot; says Fort@@ una &apos;s chief coach .
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish request for asylum application published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . however , not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
Swedish authorities for For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal@@ verk@@ et ) began the tests last year .
during the asylum process , you should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish immigration authority ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for mistakes in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were of minor age .
up to now , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 48@@ 1 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; potentially 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results are constant over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May , the agency published 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases which &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 results published , it found that in 243 of these cases the person had told frank@@ ly that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age review , where x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analysed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of human beings in order to see if they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later than usual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
jud@@ ging biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of jud@@ ging a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven @-@ ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Road Traffic and Traffic in the Government President Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three renov@@ ating bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Easy is sure the schedule will be adher@@ ed to .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch @-@ arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has meanwhile arrived in the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead across the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a marginal fix@@ ation that is also used as a run@@ way .
a 2.@@ 20 @-@ metre @-@ wide bridge board is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way is supposed to run .
the special thing about it is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger firm Di@@ z@@ wo .
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
a special touch of intu@@ ition has required laying cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre cable that many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collective farm in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is regulated by traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bach city entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed .
the cost of the three bridge arrangements is 700 000 Euro .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest at German potato salad
it doesn &apos;t happen so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to get under a hat is coming together .
the parties represented in the Reich@@ stag ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance , which on this day peac@@ efully shows the flag because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell invites to the lou@@ dly poster &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and well @-@ known names to the start - as Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel is colorful . &quot;
originally the City @-@ Pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well ground , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that is available .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the forum A world and one of the relevant organis@@ ers , really pleased : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
there is music and a lot of food , including a &quot; German potato salad , &quot; which the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police have ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D volcan@@ ei@@ fel reports , he made an effort to make such an event and get the supplement .
at first the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is glad that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the event at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also done : a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz provides entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz in the Stad@@ thalle , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D Chairman Uwe Junge .
there are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting to hear that the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ Chair Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k hold their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far , the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event lasts , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is scheduled shortly after 9@@ pm .
the police can cr@@ ush - no special incidents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher tromb@@ one player Freder@@ ic B@@ elli can be found in the row of Has@@ lach mon@@ astic concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov solo trumpet is at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo voice of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire to not only cross the boundaries on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; bl@@ ends with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz player N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play blend into a fascinating overall piece of art .
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ lach monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I want to try everything , &quot; says Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled che@@ eses , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt with bitter@@ ly .
in spite of all this , the br@@ ün@@ ette act@@ ress ass@@ ures the Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with everyone I remember .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;ve played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism .
so I have never confused or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she especially suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , scar@@ ed and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to be relative to a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the demo@@ crats have departed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gover@@ nor Justice said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia Rallye .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic nomin@@ ee H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the party change from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party , which would rather prevent us from working to make our country magnificent again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom no leadership and is not able to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel &apos;s R@@ NC President in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again .
Russian athle@@ tics chief D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of World Athletics Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes competing in gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the rep@@ orters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress have been pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized for itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do anything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress was made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships , starting on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden by trainers , he said rep@@ orters in London after a talk at IA@@ AF Council .
mour@@ ning for soldiers collap@@ sed in Mali
at a funeral service in the North H@@ essi@@ an F@@ ritz@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two have been thinking about a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
the Minister for Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing about the still un@@ resolved matter of fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , she described the two revers@@ ed drivers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts of their profession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to the highest sacrifice they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from northern H@@ esse had died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter on Thursday .
at noon , only the members of the church were f@@ arewell .
after that , the funeral service started in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the German army and politics .
among them were H@@ esse &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the German Federal Ar@@ med Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
trau@@ mati@@ zed roses settled down , the relatives were arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ s and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony in front of the church .
Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen designated the surrounding soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and sat@@ ra@@ ined .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flight operations of the fighting helicopter Tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regim@@ ent .
even Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent belonging to the soldiers , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali was not shown by the Le@@ yen : the deployment was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country by which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any details .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was shared by the Royal House on Thursday .
the Danish royal couple is traditionally buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s Cathedral Church .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed to her husband &apos;s decision , and she said it continued in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
in 2016 he retired and also re@@ tires the title &quot; Prinz@@ re@@ mahl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish Royal House .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ tra@@ at , son of a French noble race , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French emb@@ assy .
during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a hard time in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik said about the first few years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk sp@@ as@@ ms instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of corporate critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wil@@ l wants swi@@ ft re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , Nieder@@ sach@@ ar &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) does not want to res@@ ign for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday the parliament voted for the resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the surprising resig@@ nation of a Green Party from her Land@@ tag faction in Lower Saxony pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover was losing its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ westen founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) in 2018 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U group leader Björ@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his group to record them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is regularly voted on January 14 next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could rule in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves as quickly as possible his self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the Constitution provides the possibility that the Parliament el@@ ap@@ ses the trust of the Prime Minister and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these options need to be judi@@ cially reviewed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in silence all questions will be discussed if they are judi@@ cially reviewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something kur@@ i@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself insi@@ sted , &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a pendant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the dissi@@ dent de@@ pu@@ ties to return their country mandate .
&quot; of course , we assume that she has given immediate effect to her land@@ day mandate , which she has received over the green national list , &quot; said the regional president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Group president of the Green Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she deliberately decided not to lead a pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition from the Lower Saxony Green @-@ de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the elec@@ torate but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Social Democrats leader on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Parliament .
the outlet T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their last van@@ ity and fru@@ stration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty drug game and attempts to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lower Saxony &apos;s CD@@ U group leader Björ@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to take El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
the SPD leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused him of dist@@ orting the outcome of the 2013 Land@@ tag election with personal career presents .
the CD@@ U was the strongest force in the SPD ( SPD ) at that time , but the SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one voice in the Parliament &apos;s day .
agriculture ministers in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from po@@ ison@@ ers , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses contaminated eggs .
how was the sc@@ andal could happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to carefully watch the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the www.@@ gro@@ n@@ ung@@ .de consumer protection portal , the federal states provide the latest information on the eggs concerned .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
in spite of this , my house has switched off immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s involvement in close contact with the authorities .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
as the manufacturers are concerned , trade has to ensure that the products sold are traffic @-@ capable and safe for health .
if the residual value of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded in eggs , they are not market@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time , not the farms are to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to current knowledge , the production plants do not meet any immediate fault .
on the contrary , they must expect economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there are too little controllers in the case of seri@@ ousness .
is it lacking only on the staff or also in the coher@@ ent jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that uncovered the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out at 100 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is precisely why a consistent education of such events and the hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can exist are of crucial importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect complete enlighten@@ ment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able foods .
if an un@@ authorised insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumer consumers are right .
through the pan@@ i@@ cked remedy , manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts will be quickly and thoroughly elu@@ ci@@ dated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the football rules of football affect Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not b@@ other Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access@@ ing the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules that were launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G will have to prove at some point that the transfer from Ne@@ y@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and Ne@@ y@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money easy for Ne@@ y@@ mar to sign up and bring him to a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the power rich ruling family of Qatar .
associations are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but have to work with legitimate income sources , which allow them the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and risk to ruin when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from focusing on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder thing .
in the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presidential election in 2015 , his successor Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in will continue to be deter@@ red by excessive expendi@@ tures .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will continue to rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , vis @-@ à @-@ vis The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of Ne@@ y@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract .
Ne@@ y@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the selling can be reported for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.6 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time $ 82 million ) , which was later lowered to 20 million Euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs trying to list their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catal@@ an enterprise could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market value , the UEF@@ A would not have been considered legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor &apos;s sponsor@@ ship was lifted by Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ y@@ mar could come to Qatar via payments from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 noted that Ne@@ y@@ mar World Cup ambassador is going to be ambassador and such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to find out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive to any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they talked about the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accounts for the last fiscal year must be published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS@@ G expects Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s &apos;s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot purchases .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing ceremony .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s removal by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last owner to PS@@ G .
arsen@@ al Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sports Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga per@@ taining to a state that finan@@ ces an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair because there are different ways or may have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new g@@ og@@ ger supplier
over the past few years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y made board chocolate for Swiss .
now the co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline writes the contract an@@ ew .
Swiss @-@ speaking Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott , on request of the news agency , confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very happy with the current supplier of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 17 million small white @-@ white panels are distributed to 14 grams per year , the flight atten@@ d@@ ants are distribut@@ ing to the passengers prior to landing .
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the order volume according to &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious job for a g@@ og@@ ger manufacturer .
the Swiss will not want to reveal the number of applicants for the new tender .
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
according to the newspaper article Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement .
Swiss since 2006 , chocolate bars distribute Swiss Life on board their flights .
Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g before the Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary .
the opportunity to place the logo was conducted by Swiss ago two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline co@@ operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long hau@@ l flights , the First Class customers will be treated with goo@@ dies from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Sp@@ rün@@ gli , in the Business Class passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y is also part of the short circuit , both in business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia turns into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this re@@ petition of history is also nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the eigh@@ ties , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( when the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter turned the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like time scar@@ cely .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not just because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained original story for a pleasant can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by climbing up on the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play g@@ ha@@ stly children who are grown up - nevertheless , they managed the im@@ possibility to reg@@ ain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults playing adults now is less emotional and his par@@ ody goes more after the casting principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 @-@ er years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle . &quot;
at one point a character runs through an Apple Power@@ book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely co@@ op ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now novel author , still hasn &apos;t forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant plot involving Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the courses are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt Dill@@ ards &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ one from &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
there are the moments of random lun@@ atics who could heat this fran@@ chise as a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LOW &quot; with its east anti @-@ West ring combat icon@@ ography .
the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980 &apos;s with the two police officers as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic i@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an M@@ ask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
with six long epis@@ odes it moves away , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was edited for a smaller length , could better deliver its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American emb@@ assy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make all the food for a commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in beating the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart visited numerous objects , as the public prosec@@ utor Kon@@ stanz communicated on Friday .
in doing so , 15 accused were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , officials assured large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundreds of thousands of euros .
at the same time , two people were arrested at the same time in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
the Maf@@ ia &apos;s members are accused of organised crime @-@ crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the Prosec@@ ution has established Con@@ stance against organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
for this reason , the large @-@ scale deployment was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
the aim of the investigation was mainly Italian citizens with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the bank &apos;s account .
Weise lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreign register in Germany shows substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decision in case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to a media report on large gaps in the country &apos;s central register .
defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decision in case of asylum procedures and dep@@ ort@@ ations , in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; has given .
according to the data register , according to data , ten million people with foreign citizenship are reported , including approximately 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
data are therefore managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data has not been adequately maintained , data quality in parts has not been good .
in individual cases , data had been found in 1921 , &quot; by people who have long ceased to live , or of citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data inputs can slow reverse processes considerably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , in statistics on foreign nationals , EU citizens are also gr@@ asp@@ ed who do not have to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , such bog@@ us assignments led to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dist@@ orted debate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about dealing with dis@@ cour@@ aging people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the federal government has apparently begun sending refugee families back to Italy with less than 16 year old children when they have arrived from there .
this emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot;
in the paper , it is said that the BA@@ MF is conducting such procedures on families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , such as the newspaper pointing to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees trying to reach them first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a migrant passes to another EU country , the state can send him back to the entry country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the office now conclu@@ des : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I gave guarantees for the admission and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the Left faction in the Bundestag , Ull@@ a Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights conditions and a threat to child welfare due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
in a total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , blood donation service was already available to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were honored on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now donated 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the church hon@@ ors several times of willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it is in@@ gen@@ ious how our bodies are created for it , and we appl@@ aud the don@@ ors who make their blood available for strangers , nor dis@@ interest@@ ingly , &quot; emphasized mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the Kreis@@ direktor of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preser@@ ves are de@@ composed into its constitu@@ ent parts .
three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K county leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apparently , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ beer were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 blood donations .
half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pal@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter have spent ten times each 500 milliliter of their life @-@ juice .
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensi@@ fied pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members in this month pursuing an increase , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on bud@@ get@@ ary income would continue , with inflation likely to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it sign@@ alised that in the coming years interest increases would be needed to cur@@ b the inflation @-@ heated inflation and said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
members also agreed to withdraw part of the mam@@ mot@@ h economic stimul@@ us package published a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financing for banks from the coming February , although it was said that it is now expected to provide € 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot;
at the rate of interest , it repeated that &quot; a certain ti@@ ghtening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; extent than the markets would expect .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
the Bank however stressed that increases would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts revised down below for this year and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % in 2009 .
it maintained its growth forecast of 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations of a rise in interest rates and GDP grew by 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to rise by 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though after the Bank will recover slightly towards the end of the year .
the recent inflation forecast offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor increases in salary as the sharpen@@ ing will first get worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that in the coming years monetary policy could not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent income &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the spin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to the Bank &apos;s last ruling on interest rates , the call for interest rate increased as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July demanding an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation has fallen from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and will continue in the coming months .
the Bank said that the exceeding in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; quite &quot; to the weak Po@@ und .
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of the s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive as len@@ ders looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals are exp@@ iring and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are closing off , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) aims to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September following a high @-@ court fight against the funding of the medicine in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that pre@@ text pro@@ position pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being supplied by health services via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the App@@ eals Court confirmed last year that the Supreme Court of App@@ eal confirmed that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance him .
the Chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as &quot; crucial moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to make the registration of people possible , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection haz@@ ards .
pre@@ p prior to having intercourse means that just enough medication exists in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified to agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the programme is signed by £ 10 million and N@@ HS Great Britain signed a contract to supply medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of mankind &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind .
now that pre@@ p test medicine has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government .

living the Big Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced itself to an Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and an mezzanine to make optimum use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12,5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create an attic in which one could stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to allow it to work longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ r@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
by exercising a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineer art went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s counter @-@ important so that when you push the door high , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space while simultaneously using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxury advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter value of something standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar property @-@ empire
two brothers spent four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate imperialist Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors away from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to let him clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with Anna &apos;s mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood since 1973 .
there , the family founded West@@ co je@@ ans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 to 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the cit@@ y@@ scape , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - owns about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court file says that this means that Col@@ in owns property of $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proven to be an issue for Paul .
&quot; the press releases suggested by Col@@ in have left him with what I kept for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it .
last Friday , after several failed medi@@ ations , the first Supreme Court hearing was held .
the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has ruled out him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but proposes Paul to compet@@ ently manage some pos@@ sessions .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian legacy states that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both parties .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her de@@ ceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood estate in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land on trial , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , but Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very with@@ held although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of television .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad , that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ umps of new Chief of Staff are planning to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more regular course .
here is a piece of rep@@ orter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior executives on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s White House that he wanted to fix : poor information that came into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the staff that information should flow around him - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; if Miss Tr@@ ump was upset because of unfair tax reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to convince him , &quot; said the former election campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite Poli@@ tico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tr@@ ump &apos;s Twitter practice is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lob@@ b@@ ying price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; t@@ ing@@ m@@ umps is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps those camp@@ uses know something we don &apos;t know others - that the twe@@ ets without their interventions would have included more combus@@ tible material .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his employees managed to keep him away from him several times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent tr@@ ump contro@@ vers@@ y .
a part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to bring forward their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump materials that may promote their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to provide question@@ able information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press cli@@ ques , especially those with embarrass@@ ing le@@ aks , and that he will figure out where they come from .
this was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone illeg@@ ally released a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks in the White House .
although Johnson has been permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ anes or that he has offered no concrete evidence , or that he has given false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the people is requested and hoped .
the police all over Europe are sending postcards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are not known in nature , references from the population will be hoped and requested .
Euro@@ pol has reported on Friday from the action that follows the winter calendar in the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Adv@@ ent calendar .
the experience had shown that many volati@@ le displac@@ ements were hiding on holiday destinations , it was said by Euro@@ pol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have compiled 21 postcards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2016 there has been the website ww@@ w@@ .e@@ at@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .
36 of online viewers could have been arrested until now , at least eleven of them due to cl@@ ues after the publication on the website .
travellers negotiate about a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire Range &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travelers on the war foot , who have negoti@@ ated a tren@@ ch drawn by the church in order to re@@ claim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy road by Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch dig@@ ged by the Council to prevent their failures .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw rocks onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement it because it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , moved on and are now back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle it by keeping long instructions to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my common tax if the Council can &apos;t even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inhabit@@ ant who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of these travelers , just to be lo@@ oted from another round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the figures have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as quickly as possible .
in order to support our evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we shall present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birk@@ enhof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise will be .
the house at the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to open on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Birk@@ enhof through the then Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on April 13th , 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights were lost per year and also income by the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the county , the hotel building was offered to the administrative office as an accommodation , which caused controversial discussions .
the city prevented the housing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the municipal council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prospects in the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els , managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer , with its headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
welcome to Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof have been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built @-@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
the facilities include a swimming pool , a spa and a meeting room .
one does not want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer empha@@ sizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to set itself wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already conducted interviews with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s noti@@ ons were identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the amount of investments questioned , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to specify precisely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he calcul@@ ates just under a million Euros .
the exterior installations are also brought on for@@ e@@ ward , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. special medi@@ ator sets Grand Jury
in the Russia affair surrounding US president Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is alleged to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury in a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the panel has been working in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensi@@ fied his investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ c@@ aster reported that there are already first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between the firstborn son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to have pur@@ pos@@ efully ming@@ led in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between the pumps elec@@ tive campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation focuses on several men who acted as consultants of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans during the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took a close look at more and more dr@@ umps in private and business environments .
the Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the investig@@ ator Tr@@ ump has personally moved into the centre and for@@ ear@@ ns the accus@@ ation that the President may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand Jury is to check this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to raise the charges .
as a result , Grand Jur@@ ys are also called anchor chains .
they are usually switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in order to charge persons to the hearing under oath .
according to the broad@@ c@@ aster CN@@ N , inv@@ itations were issued , turning around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ ump &apos;s advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort joined the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in U.S. television that the enforcement shows that Mu@@ eller does not let himself be in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated in his work and that if necessary he should act fast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charging of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the setting of the board was the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
amid the new revel@@ ations , the President took advantage of a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic gives the demo@@ crats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the suspension of a Grand Jury .
but they usually work in secret , &quot; he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it would not be determined against the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have no reason to assume that something has changed in this way , it continued in the declaration .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this repro@@ ach , accus@@ ations against tr@@ ump have become ob@@ sol@@ ete , he tried to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
according to US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about the release of Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired on ur@@ ging the President of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators from both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented bill of law on Thursday after which the special agent could no longer be dism@@ issed as easily .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the west Ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has loos@@ ened from the scar@@ cely seven @-@ times size of Berlin from the ice shelf .
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , which weighs over a tril@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , will now push nor@@ th@@ wards and probably will take two or three years until it mel@@ ted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for human beings .
to what extent climate change has played a role in the ab@@ ort of the ice age , according to research data , it is un@@ clear .
all in all , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a factor background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
as a result , it grows further into the sea and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s lies south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this ice shelf the balance of waxing and breaking was disturbed several years ago .
a complete ice shelf can be tra@@ ced there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
I am talking about the fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f is in danger , as the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently .
in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can be broken , if a piece is broken down at a key spot .
melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ bergs does not increase the level of sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it produces after melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf shows that the gl@@ ac@@ iers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project to monitor the Ant@@ arc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth @-@ largest ice shelf in Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now entering a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under scientists he argued whether the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will now grow back or fall back in the long run and possibly collap@@ sed , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not lead the break@@ age of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many of the ic@@ eb@@ el@@ fs of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have been crushed in recent decades .
this long tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica stretches from South America .
according to the research programme British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has been war@@ med around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus t@@ ame to the areas where the temperature increases the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls to withdraw from the employers &apos; association in order to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the Reich@@ stag gained 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have left their first working day .
the teachers in the circle are apparently highly sought @-@ after .
approximately 620 applications were recorded for the places to be published this year .
nevertheless , the group is still lacking staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U is now planning to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the request of the parties , the administration will develop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the applicants &quot; short@@ ages in a forward @-@ looking manner .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself internally and extern@@ ally , show specific measures for cross @-@ beginners and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who are leaving the ministry for disease or age reasons .
so high time for action so that there are no more places to remain vac@@ ant .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , group leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common proposal with his party .
he had long been working on a rot@@ ten surprise in the cra@@ yon day when he questioned the number of personnel costs and amazed the other parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be checked to allow exit from the municipal employers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the county administration should aim with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a house tari@@ ff , &quot; so peoples .
in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials when it actually fores@@ ees Tari@@ for@@ d@@ nung for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money only exists if you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards career years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act .
last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy ag@@ grav@@ ates the tone on NGO migrants &apos; rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean if they are not allowed to continue on new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German aid organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew effectively collabor@@ ated with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year now , refused to express itself on detailed alle@@ g@@ ations by the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and evaluate the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that its crew takes on board boat migrants aboard , which are delivered to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of being over@@ thrown by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must first have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not involve any &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations .
among those who refuse to sign up , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization Mé@@ dec@@ ins sans Fron@@ ti@@ ères ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ ers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region , to enjoy tri@@ als and sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal turned out to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream levels .
in between there was again and again longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als bel@@ lowed .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival in Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again there was a look@@ out point to the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ w@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ version @-@ hu@@ ts brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium .

after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - athle@@ tic and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga is equi@@ pping for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in future instead of swe@@ ating through wind and weather over stadium racing ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cra@@ tive business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ratings included .
this has also recognized the first German lig@@ n@@ ages that are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and joined two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire quite new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that some associations climb on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup will organize the first &apos; Interactive Club World Cup &apos; in London , where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke &amp; Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football must be confronted with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal government to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the soccer simulation of FIFA will be challenged at a competitive level .
as in normal sports , Li@@ gen have long since become established in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the Asian games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it really a kind of sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to .
also Ingo F@@ rob@@ ond has long been dealing with the question .
for the professor at the German Sp@@ orth@@ och@@ schule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses that can also be found in the classic sport - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
in addition , I need cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction to responsi@@ veness .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console , but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing .
the scientist positively highlights the high integ@@ rative effect of E @-@ Sports .
players are on the move internationally , it &apos;s like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural obstacles .
a study by Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predi@@ cts rapid growth in e @-@ sports .
in 2016 , 50 million Euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ship and large tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be at 130 million .
it is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga .
however , e @-@ sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte couns@@ ell@@ ors .
many countries are already on the move .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and bas@@ eb@@ all star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
in Europe , too , things are happening .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ ó .
in the Netherlands and France , the football first league clubs , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to set up an E @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B chairman R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to fall into nostal@@ gia only , and to clear the old times , is no longer sufficient .
it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but at the same time al@@ ig@@ ning the company to the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t keep in mind that only in football everything remains as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter in charge of the texts that Con@@ rad Roy had to commit suicide
a woman from Massachus@@ etts has been sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her boy@@ friend by texts and calls to commit suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended .
Carter was con@@ vic@@ ted in June for the neg@@ ligent murder of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his vocation .
she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have taken Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has shown no regret . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they fully regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that her age or maturity or even her mental illness had a significant impact on her actions . &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there was &quot; no day , in which I did not smoke the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I go around with everything . I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my pains that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot;
Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was following the recognition that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a sponsor for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this single person with whom I have been together every day since I was born , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachus@@ etts , which makes it a crime to challenge another to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages , encouraging him to end his life .
&quot; hang yourself , hop on a building , stand up for yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All you have to do is turn on the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the event by some press .
the case shared the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Carter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was con@@ vic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ uns : learning about the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua was allowed to run as a captain in the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coinci@@ dence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FC Bayern def@@ ends a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not hurt there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
something else was different on his seat in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ me immediately saw me , even if the extra garment was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neuer was to be seen , he made the split lead to his arm .
&quot; the coach didn &apos;t announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bavaria captain .
good that one could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ ber was able to interpret the sign from the coach .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al had been chosen as a guide in the C @-@ El@@ f , which was born out of youth players , debu@@ ggers and especially from the vacation .
this is the best way to distribute sugar to those you want to keep in your mood .
those who have been chosen to enter the legacy of Lah@@ m can only use a small extra motivation .
Kim@@ ber affir@@ med : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fli@@ pped over the field as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m .
to the right , that is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and in general Kim@@ i worked in this initial formation like the one who can also take the ru@@ dder into his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ rehear@@ sed troops .
he had a look at the whole while many others were busy with themselves .
Vid@@ al tries to re@@ play his missing fitness ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches on the devil comes out to join the achievements of the Asia @-@ journey ( also only condi@@ tionally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus not to neg@@ lect their first appearance in Bavaria &apos;s jer@@ sey .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le was running alongside Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y in front of the def@@ enses , both acted in a confident manner .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le tried to build up a few times in the building .
his colleague Rud@@ y admitted that the result was &quot; not as we had hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a good performance during the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one looked at the game following the game .
Rud@@ y , for example , did not give one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ ber said good@@ bye after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new anymore .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises the pace
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Grü@@ ne ) was still an economic minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister .
Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ ser sei@@ zes the desires of the economy , which has all blocked Lem@@ ke . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al of the turn@@ around looks natural in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
this year , the Ministry hopes for a schedul@@ ing process , until 2021 the construction law will stand .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the western circum@@ stance of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan .
the goal is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees in it a sign to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
as von Wen@@ sing , the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier is aiming for a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber of Commerce pra@@ ises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the passed Master Ch@@ ecker and 2500 Euros , if the graduates themselves do the work independently within ten years after the master training .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road building will quickly create facts , and at the same time mis@@ ses the country by the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , head of the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
so far , only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to set up mobility for the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , CD@@ U faction vice @-@ president Christian Bald@@ auf ac@@ companies calculations of the invoice , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 less in the preservation of country roads than suggested .
moreover , Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to remedy the shortage of skilled labour in the region .
furthermore , the old broad@@ band expansion in the country is so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had assessed the grid supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with the rating 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about pitch @-@ breaking Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
former Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is out of politics and is still sitting in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months of in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies it cleared the field again .
Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW @-@ chairman said the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the companies as a call@@ back .
European autom@@ akers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ it diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of automotive manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ alising diesel @-@ driven exhaust gases also increases , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ren@@ oun@@ cing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices that regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but return to normal driving conditions .
several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted in the United States , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from shipping and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities acc@@ use Audi to have installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that concentrated on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the study could seriously burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributed disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ately to the gain of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , tomorrow a raft goes through Munich , which has a special message .
those who go to the Is@@ ar on Saturday will see a big raft between Fl@@ au@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with is@@ ar tourists .
but the building paper wants to clarify .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a rub@@ b@@ ish mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public@@ ity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding for the Is@@ ar is meant to shar@@ pen the wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer , the raft passed over the Is@@ ar and again this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ men , and his characters are his trademark .
even with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still drawing and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first few years as an artist he proposed himself as a drawing for congrat@@ ulation cards - which fru@@ strated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to an end in the six@@ ties : with the release of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits at the drawing table , working daily almost ten hours .
about cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches continue to find its cute figures worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a carto@@ on animation and a TV series with his figures .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any animal in his drawings - which has a thousand @-@ foot@@ er as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which will come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is decl@@ ining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought and insect @-@ borne insects , which causes scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , causing great headache .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert on the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M Agri@@ cultural Research Institute in Provence , said : &quot; la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years and much more in the spring .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ic@@ ad , a micro@@ bi@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its the d@@ warf cy@@ c@@ ades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts tourists not only , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse added : &quot; instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and slo@@ wing ev@@ ap@@ oration from the soil , but also spra@@ ying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ ing@@ ian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200@@ th anniversary .
the point of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a middle age festival .
shop@@ pers , guil@@ ds , merchants , vag@@ ans , or a land @-@ nec@@ ked camp are to be experienced in the city centre on these days .
assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat to Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce normally meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the latest may@@ hem in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ ce@@ asing drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they are to take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the rep@@ orters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed , percep@@ tions and stomach feelings are enough .
there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of being on the pay@@ roll list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no silence of violence , and while the bodies are pil@@ ing up throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has res@@ igned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under attack and threats under federal protection and until now , there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smile on his face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Special At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has initiated only two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
like most thousands of mur@@ ders committed every year with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to trial .
in the case of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is even more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the Why , we mi@@ str@@ ust everybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15th May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he just managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and he was shot 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated into the &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot;
the sho@@ oter ran away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there is practically nothing to silence about Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the country &apos;s blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , since rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums for drug king@@ doms bigger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed v@@ ein @-@ members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not forcing Val@@ dez to leave the country for its own security following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he served as an experienced journalist for North America in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the toxic@@ ity problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
rep@@ orters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting examinations without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history wherever it led .
he will@@ ingly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the CP@@ J Award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ p@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you have to take over the task which is as@@ cri@@ bed to you as a journalist - either that or you are playing the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ vogel that could curse like a port worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is his love for routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how to do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways and run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cra@@ tive sm@@ ug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , there were suddenly no cell phones allowed . days before was known that Spy@@ ware , which was sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a middle @-@ class neighbourhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the rep@@ orters were asking if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , who the governor himself described as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it has been months since the rep@@ orters have gone into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de fac@@ to under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has stained on three main stories .
there was assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known xer , Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez , in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to government spending , which concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the Gover@@ nor .
and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a souven@@ ir sheet from the Office of the Prosecutor .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug traffi@@ ckers and authorities .
a rep@@ orter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which reigned nearly the whole century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orter to write about previous incidents in this location , including one in which a son of &quot; El Ch@@ apo &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
just a few months earlier , the readers had viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; we used to have known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
journalist Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went to the office of the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office the following morning .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body has been discovered and officials say that it is his .
journalists have become lou@@ der throughout the country by typ@@ ing them in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
on this day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and killing them because they told the truth .
she has asked since then that she is re@@ group@@ ed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a uniform society .
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces committed to organised crime under a blanket .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media coverage group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the kill@@ ings have a det@@ err@@ ent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was suppos@@ edly signed by Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were in addition to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana did in Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with a editorial on the title page &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for danger .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking makes him terri@@ fied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became rep@@ orter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat at the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ vals and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further as promised by a number of cart@@ el emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the cur@@ b &apos;s edge , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens ho@@ wling nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to avoid enemies
at first glance it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a fri@@ ghtening .
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even realize that his fl@@ aky skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
the report in &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; the uphol@@ stered din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Peri@@ od between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preserved condition amaz@@ es researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he du@@ g in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2.500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy ground .
after all this hard work , the finished result is ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
researchers have discovered that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , though covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage in order to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors and used a shiel@@ ding technique , which is known as counter @-@ coating , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to ming@@ le better with its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , experts say what indicates that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum techni@@ cian Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ado@@ wing , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ady is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by enough pressure through car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ oured the wear of the confron@@ tation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ado@@ wing - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than lo@@ ot , which signals that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors must have been of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Age , &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red@@ dish brown .
scientists continue to examine the animal in terms of his life , including his preserved bow@@ el content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , got into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank to the sea floor on his back .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much further inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ served sc@@ aly skin but remains intact in three dimensions and maintains the original form of animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you just play a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is asleep . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Age was a time when huge Ther@@ mop@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , went through the earth .
although the king of them , who lived ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ rus Rex , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the current biology journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ bled in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he du@@ g in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the uphol@@ stered din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ik@@ es that ra@@ ked from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater was swe@@ pt through western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the re@@ ar@@ ming of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the house @-@ st@@ alli@@ ons still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is so rare as a profit in the lot@@ to .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right shoulder is on his side , his five fingers are spread to the top .
I can count the scales at his sole .
in the storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : just under 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , miles of traffic jams and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A@@ 8 ) some 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
according to the police , at 5@@ pm between the inter@@ facing stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) were almost 30 vehicles during a thunder@@ storm , among them probably trucks , in a row .
there is no indication of the exact number of the wounded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a light to moderate injury , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large array of rescue vehicles was at the side of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed to Munich .
in the direction of direction Munich , an approximately ten kilometres long back @-@ traffic was formed .
as a AZ @-@ rep@@ orter reported , there also came to massive disabilities on the back @-@ track - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade was not@@ ing the characteristics of the vehicle smo@@ kers who now have to count on sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between an automobile transpor@@ ters and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing is stuck in the train and sleeps .
or one is deeply involved in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ed .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes up an uns@@ us@@ h@@ aped or sn@@ aps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspec@@ tions .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the perfect map control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you can take your seat and vali@@ date your ticket .
currently , a test operation runs on two tracks .
&quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available in many other long @-@ distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said S &amp; D spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the railway ticket de@@ valuation without she@@ ep@@ skin .
in order to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers .
you also have to buy it via the train , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : you get into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customers then have a button for electronic de@@ valuation .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that Pass@@ enger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seating position Y .
if the train atten@@ d@@ ant arrives at the ticket inspection at PLA@@ Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already de@@ valued online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn is to use the passenger .
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ d@@ ant , simply check out the DB Navig@@ ator yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this enables passengers to arrange their travel time on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s marketing management board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second advantage : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who travels by train knows that apart from delays and missed trains , ticket inspec@@ tions are among the greatest anno@@ y@@ ances .
because often you have , in any case , one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or ID card is missing , or any other document you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between the train atten@@ d@@ ant and passenger , leading to a bad mood in the part or greater space and delays in the control of one &apos;s own ticket and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this applies only to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; whose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to its core .
just a day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolls through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police just killed an 18 @-@ year old child , and it is still on the streets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , to twe@@ et live .
he post@@ ulated a picture of Brown &apos;s le@@ av@@ ed body , stretched out on the street and staying there four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone in order to return to the Can@@ field @-@ Drive in the evening after twe@@ ets .
there were photos of the police and people crying , and by a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who carried a sign with the in@@ scription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman captured his ri@@ fle and cried : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11@@ pm she took her six @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the topic of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the people &apos;s point of view , who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who wore a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take them with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a peak of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be raised therein .
it must be well developed not only ac@@ tivis@@ m and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even if I &apos;m lucky enough to give her an experience , in which she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of ac@@ tivis@@ m began to take form for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my ac@@ tivis@@ m changed completely after August 9 , &quot; she said , and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , the President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
it &apos;s all come . &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar , just wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question came from Fer@@ rel@@ l in the mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; we heard people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on were not centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked together with the former Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his ac@@ tivis@@ m around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt @-@ dwell@@ ers .
his involvement brought the project closer to Fer@@ rel@@ l , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are portra@@ yed , for that is how I shall be portra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rer &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ r@@ ells &apos;s life , how she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ r@@ ells &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media after killing the black teen@@ ager , Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity .
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence , although it was at the foref@@ ront because in a life at these cross@@ roads as a black , gay woman standing so much in the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway in a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels inde@@ b@@ ted to that memory since she went on the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people , even though it hasn &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
there is hardly any cold in the subject .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents are building a gallery to attract more customers to the city , including the rest of the shops , the opponents are afraid that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is being planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands in which 13 direct marketing companies offer their products .
with the beginning of the construction work , it will end .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a Square with the possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we have been shopping for many years almost weekly in the Far@@ mers Market Hall .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the mer@@ ma@@ ids love again and again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s egg for us .
we would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
there are also other cities in other cities .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery , pay attention to the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what kind of shopping centre in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough of this in our city .
one can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a decent weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact .
after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mainly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive .
as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented from larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and that which is still left will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the Far@@ mers Market stand during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit gallery is actually coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or does the spec@@ ter bit gallery already make it possible to ou@@ st all transactions from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion it would have been better to encourage a real farmers market instead of this gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but thanks to the ins@@ ane multitude - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg do not place any more space for a farmer &apos;s market hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the peasant &apos;s market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown ones , which are almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen bands and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth &apos;s prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after being secretly drawn up diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a matching resem@@ b@@ lance ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline ent@@ ailed her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a tran@@ script and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama , when he only had three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , how anyone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since its pu@@ ber@@ ty , was con@@ vic@@ ted in 2013 because of 20 charges , including six violations of the law of es@@ pion@@ age , computer fraud and theft .
the prison was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black and white sel@@ f@@ ie in which Mann@@ ing deliberately sits un@@ well on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just out of the big success of her 2012 @-@ project &apos; Stran@@ ger V@@ isions &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ ensi@@ c art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ ts and che@@ wing gum , by extra@@ cting the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
this was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg on a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she couldn &apos;t visit at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice became an un@@ equal letter of friendship , which , over the course of two years , exchanged several letters .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o &apos;s illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future in which the President of Chelsea would transform their verdi@@ ct and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was published to demand Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy coinci@@ dence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to continue to fl@@ aring up the rigid spl@@ its he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about all these things after the strange timing , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing requested with her super@@ large signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , which is based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a centi@@ pe@@ de of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how astonishing , at least in biological respects , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video @-@ Werk from 2007 , Sp@@ ell Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic no@@ vels .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as she appears with a hands @-@ free phone in his hand from the United States &quot; discipline in disciplinary sanctions , such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they get cold , they have won &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but when it was supposed to do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ res that meet like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also hiding behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
University of North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University because of K@@ illing
a nation@@ wide human hunting is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee at the University of Oxford who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as shown by the acts of the Local Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stab@@ s .
a Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the events , and det@@ ective investig@@ ates the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , said civil servants .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for University Relations , said in an email statement that La@@ them was now in a state of absence and excluded from entering the Campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal affair being investigated by the relevant authorities , and North@@ western University co @-@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked and want him to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , who said that something had happened in Apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as being very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
security cameras confirmed that they were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA schedule in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian vice @-@ president Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( Rus@@ ada ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , Rus@@ ada has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA schedule has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s schedule to comply with the code describing the criteria for re @-@ initi@@ ation of Rus@@ ada and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren for alleged publicly funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We carry out the inquiry because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
talking to Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov published issues of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rus@@ ada was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of dop@@ ing sc@@ andal from the WA@@ DA on the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli explained that Rus@@ ada moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce @-@ start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anony@@ m@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never any consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to carry out surveys , provide specialized groups and demographic groups , allow employees anony@@ m@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T won .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can drill out why .
companies come to see that there must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next dep@@ ut@@ ator involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken will be punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is a lu@@ cra@@ tive possibility after an overview .

CH has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent companies can send bes@@ po@@ ke &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat @-@ cards of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
and when the chief executive officer is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
when a company finds its employees badly treated or beha@@ ved un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ ts , employee turnover and complaints , said Quin@@ lan .
ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
in the past , if an employee wished to issue a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the dis@@ comfort of employees .
now , as the company Con@@ ver@@ cent employs , problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or countries - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice - can be identified and addressed faster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that businesses realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of businesses , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research showing that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bet@@ s .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company feel that their voices heard and that the work you do is worth it , then they feel more committed to making this business successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , who used both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors gain margins when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if third party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts in workplace culture is important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , when a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have a expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change doesn &apos;t come quickly enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and de@@ motiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you have more than 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you don &apos;t follow employees wonder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
are you concerned about that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ strated staff , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights on employees , and hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose your business .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers talk on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some pulled off their tri@@ cot parts and show the back of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are registered to the summer courses will return to their final exam after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Wasser@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 a.@@ m .
&quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was on Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of the players , and she has actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins shifted the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as performed practical exercises in West@@ wood for the first time .
they are supposed to do 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their launch against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the change of control of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they continue plac@@ king , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices once the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been be@@ amed with pe@@ dest@@ als that clean up a protective grid behind a tor@@ ped@@ o , will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then adjust there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking place 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook aims to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false noti@@ fications from third parties and show their results below the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to invo@@ ices that may show results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they also have influenced the 2016 presidential election .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French vot@@ ers floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ ahead of the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished by social media networks , if they fail to quickly eradi@@ cate h@@ ep@@ y @-@ filled posts as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new Fac@@ ts Check will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to finding the stories of fact @-@ sur@@ vey@@ ors third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a si@@ p for Margar@@ et Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970s and 1980 @-@ er .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cosy seat in the Be@@ ware River Valley in K@@ ent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a predi@@ le@@ ction for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says v@@ ehem@@ ently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story has been illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Hand@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he un@@ expect@@ edly found emotion@@ ally .
&quot; I have only responded to the thumb@@ print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his thumb@@ print !
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were also there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is sm@@ itten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest , I have over@@ looked my welcome @-@ greeting a little &quot; ) all this seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ enas on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emig@@ rated through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape pat@@ rons , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just began to look after the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ crats said &quot; Oh , throw it down onto the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English empire , cards that represented who possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting the two families .
guys , let all go their gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revol@@ t of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion which occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant revol@@ t began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe they are connected to each other ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , who hidden the family Dar@@ rel@@ l for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is portra@@ yed from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was du@@ g out ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the Lor@@ ds seemed to be a wei@@ r@@ ker , always making debts and spending money for things they couldn &apos;t afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men rede@@ emed their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se heir . &quot;
after the end of his involvement in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique cri@@ b experiences
he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ ä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which since then has been re@@ claimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ah , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle wrapped in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the inaugur@@ ation of the 301 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his team of marketing asked Nelson Art@@ z to keep the logo and the slogan secret until Thursday .
at the end of August , there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking the poster on the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their shared web@@ page yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attra@@ c@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city a unique selling point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she is in competition with other local authorities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f pays a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount to its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on retirement and promotion in the officer cor@@ ps in Ankara .
so this week too .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine among the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
the five vice @-@ pres@@ idents and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the deliber@@ ations .
thus , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in abundance .
the government is dra@@ gging the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the forces of air and the navy were dism@@ issed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as a magnet for the coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
for 48@@ 6 persons involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negoti@@ ating in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the coup attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; given him the opportunity to &quot; fully clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ ease in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ scarf ban for soldiers , wrote the paper .
the grand pur@@ suit of the army and the security forces is still going on .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan ordered another 73@@ 95 citizen , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the lords of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as sent@@ in@@ els of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform proposals of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is target@@ ing the Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
in the &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; magazine , a notably not @-@ named officer , who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt , would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years .
if this is true , such a development could not allow NATO to be cold .
in any case , there is doubt in the alliance after the pur@@ ges of doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he intends to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way the Americans will be dealt with in other countries Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our business , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , c@@ ited by the American media .
Ministry wants route for race @-@ up shuttle
over the past few months over the future of the racing sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested - now it is to go very fast .
even before the end of the year , the mar@@ ten route , on which the tourist train rides , is to be built .
in order to secure the future of the racing sh@@ utt@@ les in the long run , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work is to begin this year .
&quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this particularly important connection , &quot; explained Minister of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the costs for the repair of the track were estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country is sur@@ passing 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle should also be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alised , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ ing@@ ian Rail@@ ways as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negoti@@ ated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l .
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle was to be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular rail link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
over the past few months , a pilot operation has been tested to see if sufficient number of people will be used to order them again in the future .
the track is also very shallow in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about
just as you thought it won &apos;t be even cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , professor for Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to begin to take her asc@@ ension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will get them to see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report .
modern sc@@ outs have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also &quot; adapt &quot; his robot according to his convi@@ ctions , and select everything from the eye color of the robot via the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it will be wor@@ rying as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ per woman look progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables users , for example , to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of timi@@ dity and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as much as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
she also has her mo@@ ods in the course of the day - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fix@@ ated on conversation or she can be &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this rise of sex robots - last but not least because they are replacing real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the all@@ usions to rape if one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is called : relu@@ ct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah al@@ loc@@ ates one the most .
on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy was compatible with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toys .
their formation and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dark and deeper in our culture , on a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional enc@@ ore .
most men will of course not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ members their growing popularity , they still remain at the edge of consumer culture .
but what perme@@ ates the boundary areas can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots would appear at a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has been pra@@ ising women to be sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report Of The Serv@@ ants &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the en@@ forced body and the engraved eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to real women as realis@@ tically as possible ( al@@ beit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no medi@@ ation or a background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .

he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of the common sense of man
it has become a tr@@ ump @-@ wisdom of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized the U.S. elec@@ torate have also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving in the USA there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump sel@@ ectable relatives .
we all o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly ex@@ ert ourselves to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power to bring down the power of m@@ umps , families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ le@@ aning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , has visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House anyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and quite strange on the same page .
for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but I notice in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the Left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ oo@@ ky way that his k@@ itt@@ ens won &apos;t b@@ ump us any more some@@ day .
however , there is an even more fri@@ ghtening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans of the Right Wing &quot; norm@@ alize &quot; that suddenly appear as the notion of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
today I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ical version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur to one as very mild off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump moves , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the New York parking department &apos;s car@@ ou@@ sels , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all clo@@ wns are cra@@ wling and the animals are twi@@ sted to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ atic music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are getting old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage - the them@@ ed pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count , but a large round@@ about in Northern London .
the Central Park @-@ car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , since here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can walk on it in the 40@@ s and all have a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the evaluation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this does not only lead to a slo@@ wing down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of making her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain moved out of prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was taken to hospital for the treatment of cuts in his wrist , which he suffered according to a case in his cell after a fall .
on account of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girl@@ friend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal to the six @-@ year jail term of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too cau@@ tious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us runs a risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four t@@ elec@@ tors from Fe@@ us@@ z and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the school holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , she welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol for the dism@@ iss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle rising up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
in addition , the m@@ lower band conducted a musical entitled &quot; The eagle in the chicken farm . &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken we@@ aving , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , and the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain .
after that , classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ bu@@ cks , the cylinders were wearing to the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Eagle stands for integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Angel@@ ika S@@ itte . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the young @-@ animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished every quad@@ rup@@ t@@ eller that he felt accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a word of gratitude to the colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps back on teaching pas@@ sports , and the parents representatives .
the time of the cu@@ cum@@ bers is over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
after two years of teaching , they only release their students very relu@@ ct@@ antly because it was a really great time .
finally she was able to rely on the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ äs@@ sler .
finally all students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
at the same time , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , c@@ ited on television , announced .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal people in Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police , among them the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have sharpen@@ ed the control of the free camp and put everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es .
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the court may impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel peak , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission performance of emissions classes Euro 5 and , in part , Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fit has ordered the Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced swi@@ ft implementation in the next few months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler advised to write to any affected person .
if any inspection is due in any case , it will be carried out within the framework .
how long will the conver@@ sions take place overall ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the slopes depend on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , voluntarily the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group do ?
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
presum@@ ably foreign manufacturers would retreat , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is there a massive decline in prices of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but just in regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there have been no real losses for older diesel up to now .
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Award Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize giving prize under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the prestigious awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) also belong to the scholars .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally US president Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the winner of the award winner Le@@ ar , announced with progressive TV series , already announced that it would not be possible to participate in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clarify her views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kennedy Center , named after the former president , John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
among the earlier winners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city li@@ vable
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s city building master , goes into retirement in the coming year .
the place is already written - but suitable applicants are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a city master for 31 years .
and the work is still a great pleasure for him , as he communic@@ ates in press brief@@ ing .
he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application fulfil@@ ls the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
so - taking notice of the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a famili@@ ar@@ isation .
since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as the Lower Building Law Authority , the applicant has to report corresponding conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it could no longer be completed , citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the proximity to the town is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports of a good working climate and good mood between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , several important projects have been accumulated to look back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city li@@ vable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction office and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a area and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking area are about to be initiated .
the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium re@@ clam@@ ation is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will strike about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is a large le@@ e@@ way for a city master .
Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dening can be re@@ acted quite flexi@@ bly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye for what fits &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring Stadt@@ bau@@ aker points out .
in any case , the city engineer will bear great responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything is going over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( civil engineering ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good business climate but also for the further design of the city .
if you would like to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , according to the City of Has@@ lach , you should be able to present a completed academic studies as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ elor with the subject of architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt is subject to civil engineering , civil engineering , structural planning , bur@@ der@@ land affairs , municipal property management , municipal farm with building yard and urban gar@@ dening , as well as under construction law authority including monument protection .
bike thrown on lines : Süd@@ bahn distance locked
according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bike off the track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rators and have been looking for them since the night .
near the scene , a sho@@ oter &apos;s wheel@@ er and a bicycle driver were witnessed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Lausanne region , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator would have put himself in danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
in addition to the damage done to the locom@@ otive and the plant as well as the delay of the delay and the costs of rail replacement , P@@ ön@@ als of the railway customers could also come to the cul@@ pr@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern run@@ way could be conducted without disabilities .
almost ten passenger trains failed in the morning , two of them concerned the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall out , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts have also been damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims the exact opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , an inflammatory bow@@ el disease can result from this .
experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have made a connection between a type of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han fav@@ ours a more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system also plays in humans .
the post@@ doctoral student , Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan , examined a kind of immune cell that encourages tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tri@@ bal , but which was separated , did not .
it suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal tract .
the mice were sequ@@ enced in DNA and six species of bacteria were found which were present in mice with the immune cells but lacking in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they were given the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria were working on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i were able to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as the In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us are protecting L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal tra@@ cts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote as these cells control inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines .
potential high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can potentially lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United is committed to &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius &quot; , Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho writes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last Pre @-@ Season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday began , and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
M@@ atic was excluded from the pre @-@ emp@@ tive Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which allowed Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium , when Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho formed his start XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of his four primary obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three out of four , I thank the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have taken great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turned out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the head of the SPD , S &amp; D Prime Minister always looked after Berlin with a certain anxiety before elections .
only a fire from the party centre , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the election fighters .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt &apos;s house have observed the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals .
what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind .
they were deep hits .
and one by one .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German Editor @-@ in @-@ office network ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising faction of a Gre@@ ens Euro MPs over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the election election his red @-@ green coalition thus lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Federal Executive Director Michael Kell@@ ner has called on El@@ ke T@@ westen &apos;s apo@@ state , Lower Saxony Green &amp; Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the elec@@ torate .
El@@ ke T@@ westen needs to return her mandate immediately , &quot; said the Federal Executive Director and election head of the Gre@@ ens to the German Editor Network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true all at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election fighter si@@ gh , when on Friday morning the new message of Job reached the party centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD minister of the SPD of Lower Saxony , stands there after the resig@@ nation of the green de@@ pu@@ ties of El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without their own government majority .
it is the pro@@ visional peak of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery began with the unexpected defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades comfor@@ ted at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then - and indeed everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to stag@@ ger , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te raised the party smoothly .
ti@@ ring the comrades in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , when they had just picked up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with him came the next drop .
mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nim@@ bus this weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in the after@@ math of crisis communication he made everything wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for its political survival .
so now Stephan Wei@@ l .
due to the VW @-@ emission aff@@ aires and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony had already been under fire for a long time .
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
nonetheless , or perhaps just because of this , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Bund in recent weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .
they allowed him to grant him because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party from ordination .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in this context , Wei@@ l meets the party internal purpose of the Lower Saxony Green Party in the absence of guilt .
and Schulz is not at all .
for the time being , the comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger appe@@ aled to the Gre@@ ens , and above all to the apo@@ state parliament in T@@ westen .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Ms. T@@ westen has put their own career perspectives on the interests of everyone else , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liament@@ ary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. T@@ westen is not elected as a direct candidate because of her personality , but has been elected to the Parliament by the Land List of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens , &quot; says Lower Saxony &apos;s de@@ pu@@ ties .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liament@@ ary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vot@@ ers four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a candidate for the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he demanded to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments from the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for the centre of the city III
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to rehabil@@ itate his house in the years can soon gain support from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives ST@@ EC informed urban development on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler again gave a review of what has happened so far .
since 1991 , there are in sensi@@ cal remedi@@ ation areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the restructuring area II between 2005 and 2016 , the subsi@@ dy amounted to 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; achievement project &quot; - it is finally important to promote internal development , not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the Government Pres@@ idency Karlsruhe provided the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the funding amount was 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest from the congregation sens@@ ations .
how is a rehabilitation area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will continue to investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it also plays a role in which interest exists in the planned area at all .
if necessary , the area boundaries may be moved again .
the ST@@ EG spent on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programme in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the programme is the revit@@ alisation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , i.e. per plot .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a by@@ laws .
the funding period for the funding is scheduled for 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
however , until September this year , the stock@@ taking stock would only be carried out , within the framework of which the involved parties involved a questionn@@ aire for filling out .
in November or December , the decree will take place as soon as possible , so that in the coming year it will be possible to start renov@@ ations .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that each Commun@@ e had to carry out the said preliminary investigations .
it is about evalu@@ ating the urban gri@@ ev@@ ances and deciding when to scale and to what extent .
there will be a re@@ mark in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to emotion and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel emphasized that the project was an essential success factor for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; building and property sheet , &quot; in which it is concerned , among other things , the structural condition and the renovation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information on the size , layout and occup@@ ants of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be completed if the premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is important to note that a stu@@ ffed questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler said that the distribution of subsidies after the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; function - whoever comes first , grin@@ ds first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no funds can be reserved for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the project , photos of the project &quot; City Center II &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; tasty &quot; renovation .
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between Dau@@ men and Zei@@ gef@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory aes@@ the@@ tist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now installed at home as well as with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a South La@@ wn marine helicopter for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to military records that were left to TIME Magazin to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 countries .
the helicopter , which was manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was on display next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a Wis@@ cons@@ in fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ter car and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the deputy nav@@ al commander for aer@@ on@@ au@@ tics .
the news showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 pm and so long remained until the grass was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of the hours , a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the plane during the time on the aircraft .
from the records provided by TIME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal states to use state property for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate the purpose .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the comm@@ anding officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an impulse to reform the health reform that was under way in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes .
pres@@ idents are required to use them for the journey .
but to demand their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump launched an investigation in February when the presidential jet emerged in the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all over 50 countries that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently carry out training flights around Washington and South La@@ wn to susp@@ end U.S. pres@@ idents in the White House with precise metric sets .
when Tr@@ ump was in Germany at the G@@ 20 in early July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House led 58 exercise land@@ ings .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted on the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters flew in addition 11 hours a day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took the load for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter down on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget labels for presidential aer@@ ations , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D refund rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
the unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for calcul@@ ating rates is extremely mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the refund rates for Do@@ D not include personnel costs , but also cover the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know Sik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to emphasize this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House Tr@@ ump talked to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and sh@@ one with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss Kne@@ eling Task
the championship runner @-@ up of the second tennis league of the Bundes@@ liga matches the championship ki@@ cks Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss ki@@ cks off in Kiel tomorrow from 11 o &apos;clock at the South Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
despite five games still fla@@ w@@ less balance sheet , the leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga was able to make sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that is always playing in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right on the post@@ erior position I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the imports from the high north provide for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to assignments in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a glance at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reel ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be hard for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue and white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man currently active in the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian bi@@ ella does not succeed in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) is playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ans An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he was supposed to be in ke@@ el as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niels Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ ag@@ n@@ ina .
after his two vic@@ tories against the Club at the Al@@ ster last Sunday , also Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could back into the team again .
if the 18 year old Hungary , who was the number one of the Junior World Ran@@ king in January 2016 , does not fill up the cad@@ re from the trainer by Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he set his signature on Wednesday evening under the law of ti@@ ghtening the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his capacity to en@@ act the law , &quot; Congress packaged a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he said .
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US offensive .
after all , the draft plan to pun@@ ish European companies that will help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU .
since then , investors from the local O@@ MV , which are co @-@ financed with other European companies , are involved in the construction of the Russian East Coast North Stream 2 .
the Dro@@ h@@ ul@@ isse is enormous .
however , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions by executive order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at which the group could ward off and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ co &apos;s Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is the focus of the hit series by Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not over yet .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first got their first trailer and showed the latest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful sponsors , they &quot; operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ u@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ u@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ac@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian prosecution authorities to support the war on drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on September 1st .
roll backwards : the town turns 46 cu@@ cum@@ bers
the city re@@ organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch@@ time itself .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a mapping to the team .
the clock is turned back in the city &apos;s day@@ care centers .
on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is still out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked food .
in the Kre@@ feld area , the city operates 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 children are given a hot meal at lunch time .
in the past Kit@@ a@@ year there were 28@@ 00 children sitting at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for by 45 hours of the week &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eat at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid for 35 @-@ hour care when children stay up to 2 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time workers have kitchen service from 1 September : they heat the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , arrange the meal individually , give off the food , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the workers are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven rough units - decides about the timet@@ able .
&quot; the kitchen workers are now firmly part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the kit@@ esur@@ fing management to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what it is all about : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team would be useful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen workers - is being done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen power also has the charm that it presents itself in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign award for the city as the most economical one , it says from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are newly set .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
for managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie , a union wants to make sure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glas@@ gow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the factory which , besides other products , produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that workers and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s called on &quot; expressing concerns &quot; that financing for moderni@@ zation of production lines would not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we are not able to gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned .
generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the Glas@@ gow city area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advantages .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow is in urgent need of a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond immediately because we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment , continuously monitor our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are fully aware of T@@ oll@@ cross &apos;s legacy as a production site . if our operations are changing at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of Ne@@ y@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave Ne@@ y@@ mar after having submitted an offer of £ 189 million to release his release cl@@ ause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the record of the world record ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after the termination , Ne@@ y@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paying professional ath@@ l@@ ete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way Ne@@ y@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ an Executive Board insi@@ sts that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but three years ago the football world was warned by the PS@@ G president in front of this prospect ?
when Manchester City was interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning to every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association in the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G middle @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circum@@ stance , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Ne@@ y@@ mar .
sco@@ oter kno@@ cked and damaged

for an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police are looking for witnesses .
because a car approached him in his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and hit the crash barrier .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um came on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au with his VW at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
in the area of the b@@ ypass of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane so that he had to move to the right .
the Tour@@ an driver then touched the guard plan@@ ks .
in the car , material damage originated .
the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident damaged it may well be that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all .
the police now request witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the responsible vehicle to contact the Com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au under Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s report lists Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s report on mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; declared after publication in comparison with the German Press Agency , he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and today Card@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false assessment of the events .
the Vatican paper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; double standards &quot; would be measured .
in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is a &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deed &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future . however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; is striking , &quot; says the writer Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian bio@@ eth@@ ic committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday life and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it as normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; you would like to go to the church and that is a dev@@ out fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows have been a normal educational means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with nau@@ gh@@ ty children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in connection with the reports of mis@@ use cases , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger , writes ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly does the 440 @-@ page report commissioned by the di@@ oc@@ ese Regensburg to En@@ lighten@@ ment Ulrich Weber , commissioned by the di@@ oc@@ ese Regensburg ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that in many cases Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister has applied forms of physical and psychological violence .
even with a high degree of emotion@@ ality , punishment for the students could also be more violent .
in contrast to many other accused , however , many victims claim that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. , and that is why in many cases , despite violence , many of them even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview , Ez@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , reli@@ eved his mind .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence doing violence at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; presents a contradi@@ ctory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students highlight his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which was pal@@ p@@ able by the econom@@ ist when a domain spar@@ row did not bring top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long story from the front to the rear , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found in it at all .
only eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly exemp@@ ted from any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the princip@@ ality of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool was also outside its sphere of influence .
at best it is possible to repro@@ ach him , to learn from it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , on which it worked , was felt as literally &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the vast majority of his pupils , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , also testi@@ fies as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and was &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to ab@@ rup@@ ts .
the fact that he didn &apos;t just pop with chairs and cast the key on the floor , but also shared ear cand@@ y and pulled too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself acknowledged even years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the time , 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as teachers .
do you know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what it actually is about in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the use of violence in the pre @-@ school , these are ad@@ mitt@@ edly bag@@ at@@ elles .
then one wonders if it is not more likely to do with his fame and his role as Brother Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media have just rus@@ hed on him .
many who have never understood him at the Bavarian pop@@ e are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the truth is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report lists Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the media , in connection with the report , a great deal was reported about abuse during the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is also accused of any involvement or complic@@ ity with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted itself to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even confi@@ de themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a leader who had been a colleague of the perpet@@ r@@ ator professionally .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Schüler R@@ atz@@ inger evaluate the role in terms of the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a sought @-@ after pup@@ il phr@@ ased it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I consider it ... also for really absurd , to assume that ... Bu@@ ben would have opened more forc@@ eful or clear@@ er , or even more , than against their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust@@ worthy teachers , etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report conclu@@ des with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the students and / or their surroundings affected him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free from any complic@@ ity .
so he cannot be accused of having not prevented or brought him to the display .
therefore , there is no reason to connect his good name with these conf@@ lic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was a lot to read about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , is accused of &quot; looking away &quot; in the report .
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything is mixed up in the reporting and bl@@ ended into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely the abuse of the report .
there is namely , ne@@ at@@ ly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the gramm@@ ar school of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other alle@@ g@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the cathedral @-@ cats .
the whole hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were really har@@ assed and portra@@ yed , and suffered from them all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um .
on the other hand , as most of the witnesses pointed out , the topic of &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o .
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline indeed , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases even have positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
at the most , it remains the repro@@ ach to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just begun to establish himself and was in charge of the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner at a school where he had just not worked and was responsible , ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then back in 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently eng@@ ul@@ f ears from the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , who even re@@ produced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the primary school will continue to practice the punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended an urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as the test pun@@ ishments were banned in Bavaria long ago .
before that she took place in a legal grey area , as everyone knows of us yet .
it was difficult for him to estimate where the concerned might have been exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible border had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this simply is not true .
only in 1980 , the examination of schools in Bavaria was officially abol@@ ished .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis stated that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the time .
how do you see it ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans talk about the &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger of jud@@ ging the past in accordance with today &apos;s moral standards .
the princess is right .
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was abom@@ in@@ able and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls .
this is all aw@@ ful and I am happy that it will finally be re@@ worked .
but at the same time I must protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
its means to discipline and pun@@ ish , so to sla@@ p ear @-@ eyes and on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
as physical punishment was forbidden , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of its Regen@@ s@@ burger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger shown in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the topic of testing also come to language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , from his perspective , since the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a supporting role .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t even conc@@ eal that he led a strict regim@@ ent there .
but even this has to be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ ce from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not even make a big singer and stand before any success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in talking to her book ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger thoroughly and again and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deeply believing and hear@@ ty people , of whom one can &apos;t imagine that he could do something for a fly too .
as many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , I receive regular contact with him today , 23 years after his appointment , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who did not forgive him until today , that he once was stern to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the cathedral @-@ cats today are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , father@@ ly teacher - a strict father , sure , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect , to which she is still looking at and hon@@ oring her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and please , once more clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What you repro@@ ach him are educational methods that were on the order of the day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the report that has just been published releases it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the starting point would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and maybe even Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
