<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel, where it is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunneling tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card Munich is promoting exciting stories for days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows who had to get upset because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal Bayern of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but precisely for that reason very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and communities in the area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a flickering carpet, which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the big overview map, more detailed maps, so-called primary-position papers, were incorporated for towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian survey administration between 1810 and 1864, and the first surveying of Bavaria was born.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French Army commander occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops retreated with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV. Joseph pushed the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying business.</seg>
<seg id="19">The original work sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all the others on the Bavarian State Library's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of Early / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is the sendling that appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling became 21 years after the creation of the map, so 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, there is Ssendling in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses were built around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser only in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered flags of the so-called "urine" from which the property tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "small plots do not show farmers there anymore - but small farmers of the" "" "" "" "land in the sun" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Ssendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the October test, was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "on Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lünen," but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "there was the Munich-Irrensplatz" "" "" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "" "" "in 1858 / 59." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended up questioning the so-called Irren." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also prohibited the staff to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, too, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirzer anstalt in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar Amper Hospital Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrist, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet in the Munich Salesianum on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV München Ost, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was erected - architectural reference to the original building of the Irrensplatz, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "" "" "Main Square" "" "" "" "in 1856." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business buildings and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn tribal route takes place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publicizes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Union for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, requires afro-american travelers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention when traveling through the state, as a number of dubious, racial incidents lately occur throughout the country and can be noted here," says the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent Missouri law, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, and the State prosecuting authorities, disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that people pass." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted apologies such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more gasoline during the voyage and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being charged with a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of Missouri's Office of Attorney General, showing that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "" "" "said Chapel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be willing to take care of chewing money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report program, which ranks the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had passed immigration laws, committed local law enforcement agencies to arrest people due to immigration violations, which will contribute to the further racial profile according to the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac gave a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU town association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the pivoting cemetery of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann granted first insight into his farm in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 cows and also many kittens supplied and accommodated in five apartments Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Schwarzwaldmilch" is the alternative marketing route for him for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also the BLM chairman of Fischbach, he described the electric fence project as "elementary important."</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profit on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green surface ensures a lot of work, a lot has to be done with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with topography," "" "" "" "stressed Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he had no biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "the Commune has recognized the significance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader-promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be drafted for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they will continue their operation," "" "" "" "said the mayor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised for funding</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open-plan area is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of €71 500 was promoted by leaders, one quarter contributed to the commune of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and maidens it is not possible." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "Peter White also stated:" "" "" "" "best food is produced here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The county guideline (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state support of wheat fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a conveyance marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the area to be fenced must not be smuggled (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway for the fisherman's electric fence project in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The accounting area is equal to 35 hectares, and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firm square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boating owners and liberty imitators would have dured him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their importance, and in particular the importance attributed to her, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "" "" "the poem you refer to, which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Miller is really right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's crumbling words, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weariness, your poor, / your crowded masses, who desire to breathe freely, / the eleventh waste of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "" "" "there was never a time when" "" "" "" "iling Waste" "" "" "" "was better to see on our screens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumppumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was intended to show connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American navel.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change it for a long time from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo-conservative to bring the American flame into the reclaimed world: "Lady Liberty is progressing.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is said to bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "" "" "the torch should not light the way to the United States." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is rather unusual here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible travels on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not light the way, but hate hatred, which is their sole source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the British team.</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>

<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or exercise, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "" "" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh made quite naturally were great." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete with the 400 m hurdles at their fifth world championships, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes in the world championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-range runner Muir leads on this road and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part at 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman, which one should watch after a great season, which included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only Scotsman in the Lee McConnell team.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammate colleagues voted for me and chose me, makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>

<seg id="155">As for my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking Critics via Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the citizens of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something about bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers proposed him for all, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He pampered with criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "" "" "for in 1783 Washington said:" "" "" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union ensued it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "" "" "said many people." "" "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type such as Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">That is why the blocking of people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum, which is called official and paid by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, spokesperson Questionin Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swank the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people speaking with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and non-profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same issue, then they are regarded by some rather than a collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "" "" "what the governor expressed as" "" "" "" "concentrated spam" "" "" "" "would probably be called" "" "" "" "intercession." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical leaks and to arrest and silence protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones on this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County declared the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers struck on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, which criticised his position on the treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overpowered his ministry, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence her.</seg>

<seg id="367">According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokov's election campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia's unquiet eastern provinces of Papua and Western papua: visa denial and a black list," he said in an explanation.</seg>

<seg id="412">More than 3 percent agreed to have worn knowingly items with blades by security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male interviewees also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many mistakenly smuggled goods had brought through airport security and how many had done it intentionally.</seg>

<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles last year.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models should be merged - 500,000 will be, 2020 a million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obviously there.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk there are currently 1800 reservations per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Anyone who orders a "Model 3" can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive his brand-new, never-tested production lines without any major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">However, if it comes to greater delays, the liability of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="438">Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running in droves.</seg>
<seg id="439">EPA chief Pruitt withdraws due to the delay in the rules of the Obama Era to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">One day after he had been sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environment Protection Agency, resigned his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smog-induced air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of state-owned environmental agencies compared to previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint lodged against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeals.</seg>
<seg id="443">The deadline was 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for ozone governance.</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he will be hesitating for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "getting involved in local decisions or hampering economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump's Attorney General of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Prelitt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulating or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the section regulatory rollback agenda." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, which obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal in Ozone standards would simply reinforce the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"under former administrations, the EPA has often not adhered to the deadlines for carrying out and then waiting to be prosecuted by activists and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who deplored the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation through judicial procedures, and we take deadlines seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "" "" "we also take the law and the authority that gives us serious." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the Ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumors Celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius' Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm is invited to a serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of Tumarc a concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "" "" "Walter Martini stresses:" "" "" "" "it is a unique village gem." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergischer prototype. "Graf Hermann von Sulz sold the Berg with the rectory church to Tumlingen together with the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document of the deed, beside the former parish church, besides the former parish church, there was also a magnificent courtyard, to which the church or the patronate was owned and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which today are still visible in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the beautiful settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Ancient maps dating back to 1600 underscore these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage originated from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, buried and filled with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greater of the two crush on Christmas in 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were inserted and the bell pieces were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church-bases and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church were threatened in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing impellers.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hilariuskirche was broken off.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night in 1834, a storm broke the church tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was aborted.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the present tower-werg was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wem care about the "creative retirees" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius facility.</seg>
<seg id="494">As a promoter, the friends and promoters of Tumarc invite on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann's location speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">To the end of the serenade, a potion takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers present the fantastic view.</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade only takes place in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for tumbling and radio silence.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and supporters of Tumlinnen are particularly committed to home care, such as the serenade organiser Walter Martini.</seg>
<seg id="504">Association wants to approve approval of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"Boisheim wears" does not foresee any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the councillor.</seg>
<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim wears" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone exists at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy usage for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "" "" "such zones will prevent" "" "" "" "saving" "" "" "" "of the landscape." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="511">The city of Viersen had decided a second wind-force concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days before, but the district government of Düsseldorf did not approve, because of a formation fault.</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning law, the approved permit is still unlawful and therefore also to take back," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="513">The current state of affairs: before the summer break the city council once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "Erkens:" "" "" "" "this marks the issuance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines systematically excluded." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="517">The circle takes her to the occasion to check the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday refused to agree on the argument of the association "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four each 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of some 11,400 households should be covered - this corresponds to about a fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersens city council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in Linnich near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="631">This time when Razoli says the N word, he says it sharp and with imprint.</seg>
<seg id="632">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>
<seg id="633">This repetition ends violent and fast.</seg>

<seg id="753">On the ground floor he would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total area of 70 square meters for a special price.</seg>
<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the Council of Communities sets out to see such a common space not as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the seniorenrighteous housing, but openly into the church.</seg>
<seg id="755">For example, the word "Strickcafé" made the round.</seg>

<seg id="760">Needless to say, Wilfried Sohmer doesn't mean that he is this additive.</seg>

<seg id="797">In the resin, the country's first "star path" is to emerge.</seg>
<seg id="798">The association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg is planning this.</seg>
<seg id="799">A planetary path exists in Göttingen - since 2003.</seg>
<seg id="800">A "star trail" is coming to meet the need for information of many harzers.</seg>
<seg id="801">He combines nature, science, movement and athletic achievement.</seg>
<seg id="802">The members want to place tables along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.</seg>
<seg id="803">In a first phase by 2018, the association is planning "well attainable installations at five to six locations" in Oberharz.</seg>
<seg id="804">Inquiry boxmen St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.</seg>
<seg id="805">The information on the tablets should be supplemented by internet.</seg>
<seg id="806">For this reason, a good mobile network welcome plays a role in selecting a location.</seg>
<seg id="807">Accessibility was also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">Later, the Train Ticket to Ride is to be extended.</seg>
<seg id="809">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the star path, the viewer experiences a lot of worth knowing, for example about the physics of the individual stars," "" "" "" "said the association." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="810">They also learned why stars would have different colors, or why a star stronger than another, even though it was much further away.</seg>
<seg id="811">It is also possible to see in which constellation is a selected star and when it is best to see.</seg>
<seg id="812">The association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014, the highest observatory in Northern Germany.</seg>
<seg id="813">According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="814">Often from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly.</seg>
<seg id="815">Since 2003, in the university town, there has been something similar to the Planetary route at the initiative of the Förderverein planetarium Göttingen since 2003.</seg>
<seg id="816">Beginning before Gebhard's Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its stelae leads up to Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an extraterrestrial "site in Diemarden (municipality Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.</seg>
<seg id="817">The stelae with the individual planets - including the Pluto - demoted to the dwarf planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.</seg>
<seg id="818">The earth is shrinking so to a scoop of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the exact height of the sun is 70 centimeters away.</seg>
<seg id="819">The entire distance of the planet is a good four kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="820">While the light from Sun to Pluto requires approximately eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the plug with Pluto.</seg>

<seg id="883">New results of the Swedish request for asylum application published</seg>
<seg id="884">The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which were subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years. however, not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">Swedish authorities for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">During the asylum process, you should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish immigration authority (Migrationsverket) has been criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were of minor age.</seg>
<seg id="887">Up to now, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were evaluated as 18 or older, while in 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "potentially 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"" "" "" "in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person" "" "" "" "may be under 18 years old." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the person's age is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are constant over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we do not see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant," "" "" "" "he said to The Local." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May, the agency published 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases which "suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results published, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had told frankly that she would be 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of medical age review, where x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticized in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of human beings in order to see if they were going through puberty sooner or later than usual.</seg>
<seg id="898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="900">"" "" "" "if we cannot say it certainly, we should not do as if we could," "" "" "" "he said to the Metro." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="901">Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "in general, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low.</seg>
<seg id="902">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the greatest risk is when the person is under 18, in this case, this is about 10 percent." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="904">The works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday a seven-ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it runs great," "" "" "" "says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road Traffic and Traffic in the Government President Freiburg." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the works began at the same time on all three renovating bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Easy is sure the schedule will be adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads through the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is an arch-arch bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has meanwhile arrived in the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead across the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are built of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were erected in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a marginal fixation that is also used as a runway.</seg>
<seg id="919">A 2.20-metre-wide bridge board is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is supposed to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about it is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger firm Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">A special touch of intuition has required laying cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre cable that many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crayfish first had to be fished.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard and the collective farm in the direction of Schramberg the traffic is regulated by traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at Lauterbach city entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully closed.</seg>
<seg id="929">The cost of the three bridge arrangements is 700 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="930">The whole thing is financed by the country.</seg>

<seg id="932">It doesn't happen so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), what else is difficult to get under a hat is coming together.</seg>
<seg id="933">The parties represented in the Reichstag (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Linke) belong to a broad alliance, which on this day peacefully shows the flag because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the loudly poster "great election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="934">And well-known names to the start - as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24, and the deputy chairman Beatrix of Storch.</seg>
<seg id="935">But those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event don't want to listen to the AfD but demonstrate.</seg>
<seg id="936">The motto "The Eifel is colorful."</seg>
<seg id="937">Originally the City-Picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the well ground, but now takes place on the parking lot below the Rondells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.</seg>
<seg id="938">A colourful picture that is available.</seg>
<seg id="939">And what Christa Karoli, chairwoman of the forum A world and one of the relevant organisers, really pleased: "great how many people have come together here."</seg>

<seg id="941">The police have ordered many civil servants to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the railway station, which is only a few metres away from the venues.</seg>
<seg id="942">How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?</seg>
<seg id="943">Mario Hompes of the AfD volcaneifel reports, he made an effort to make such an event and get the supplement.</seg>

<seg id="947">This is also done: a band for entertainment at the Rondellvorplatz provides entertainment at the Rondellvorplatz in the Stadthalle, including the rheinland-Palatinate AfD Chairman Uwe Junge.</seg>
<seg id="948">There are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting to hear that the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the Vice-Chair Beatrix of Stork hold their speeches.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence remains unchanged, but so far, the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">A little more than an hour the AfD event lasts, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there it is scheduled shortly after 9pm.</seg>
<seg id="951">The police can crush - no special incidents.</seg>

<seg id="955">Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchestras.</seg>
<seg id="956">So Petkov solo trumpet is at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo voice of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="957">Both unite the desire to not only cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.</seg>
<seg id="958">Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new garment, Daniel Schnyders's "world music" blends with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of the jazz player Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free play blend into a fascinating overall piece of art.</seg>

<seg id="1090">How can consumers protect themselves?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Minister of Agriculture, Christian Schmidt (CSU), is in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) speech and response.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?</seg>
<seg id="1093">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I can only encourage all consumers to carefully watch the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1094">At the www.gronung.de consumer protection portal, the federal states provide the latest information on the eggs concerned.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Even if according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically impossible.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Now Aldi takes over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the reconnaissance of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived?</seg>
<seg id="1098">Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="1099">In spite of this, my house has switched off immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany's involvement in close contact with the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1100">All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="1101">As the manufacturers are concerned, trade has to ensure that the products sold are traffic-capable and safe for health.</seg>
<seg id="1102">If the residual value of 0,005mg / kg is exceeded in eggs, they are not marketable.</seg>
<seg id="1103">Unloaded eggs can however be sold and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="1104">This time, not the farms are to blame.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat?</seg>
<seg id="1106">According to current knowledge, the production plants do not meet any immediate fault.</seg>
<seg id="1107">On the contrary, they must expect economic damage due to the presumed illegal practices of service companies.</seg>
<seg id="1108">As always, there are too little controllers in the case of seriousness.</seg>

<seg id="1111">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out at 100 percent." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1112">This is precisely why a consistent education of such events and the handover to the public prosecutors in the cases where criminal offences can exist are of crucial importance.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the football rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered issues of European football clubs will not bother Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules that were launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money easy for Neymar to sign up and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the power rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but have to work with legitimate income sources, which allow them the break-even point in their business-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risk to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder thing.</seg>
<seg id="1133">In the current three-year period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the presidential election in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin will continue to be deterred by excessive expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely, FFP is not dead and we will continue to reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, vis-à-vis The Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the selling can be reported for the next five years in the amount of 44.6 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time $82 million), which was later lowered to 20 million Euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs trying to list their financial supervision by inflating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan enterprise could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market value, the UEFA would not have been considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsor's sponsorship was lifted by Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar via payments from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 noted that Neymar World Cup ambassador is going to be ambassador and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators could be easy to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "accounts for the last fiscal year must be published." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot purchases.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars removal by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last owner to PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American Sports Tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga pertaining to a state that finances an association.</seg>
<seg id="1155">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," "" "" "" "said Wenger on Thursday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1156">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "once a country has an association, everything is possible." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new gogger supplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">Over the past few years Chocolat Frey made board chocolate for Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the co-operation is in front of a possible end: the airline writes the contract anew.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss-speaking Meike Fuhlrott, on request of the news agency, confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Northwestern Switzerland" from Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very happy with the current supplier of Chocolat Frey," "" "" "" "said the speaker." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1165">Approximately 17 million small white-white panels are distributed to 14 grams per year, the flight attendants are distributing to the passengers prior to landing.</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious job for a gogger manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="1169">The Swiss will not want to reveal the number of applicants for the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But there are only Swiss manufacturers in question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper article Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Swiss since 2006, chocolate bars distribute Swiss Life on board their flights.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Barry Callebaut has delivered chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros subsidiary.</seg>
<seg id="1175">The opportunity to place the logo was conducted by Swiss ago two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1176">The airline cooperates with different Swiss chocolate producers.</seg>
<seg id="1177">On long haul flights, the First Class customers will be treated with goodies from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Swiss Schoggi of Chocolat Frey is also part of the short circuit, both in business and economy class.</seg>
<seg id="1179">Athletics - Discus Olympic Champion Robert Harting achieves world championship final</seg>
<seg id="1180">The three-time World Champion is fighting for a medal on Saturday in the final.</seg>
<seg id="1181">His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, failed to compete in the national WC deposition and could only look at the discus competition from the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="1182">Also with the first attempt the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw the 65,13 meter far, qualified for the final battle.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Nostalgia turns into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is also nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the eighties, for the 90-year-Grunge era (when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise it feels like time scarcely.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, not just because of its absurd humour (it contained original story for a pleasant can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By climbing up on the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play ghastly children who are grown up - nevertheless, they managed the impossibility to regain the last part of the Witzes.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults playing adults now is less emotional and his parody goes more after the casting principle, including a riff on the Stalker movies of the 90-er years like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point a character runs through an Apple Powerbook, some Inline Skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The lovely coop (Mr. Showalter), now novel author, still hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-malignant plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the courses are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillards's sublippenbone from "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">There are the moments of random lunatics who could heat this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the gang of movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War from "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east anti-West ring combat iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy with Rhys Thomas, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980's with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executable producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Finde'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is very committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan Mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes it moves away, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"comrade Detective," which was edited for a smaller length, could better deliver its agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef always visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make all the food for a commitment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Strike against drugs mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police succeeded in beating the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart visited numerous objects, as the public prosecutor Konstanz communicated on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1213">In doing so, 15 accused were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, officials assured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundreds of thousands of euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the same time, two people were arrested at the same time in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Against the two suspects Italians there were German arrest warrants.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore probably delivered to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">In total, more than 300 policemen were deployed.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The Mafia's members are accused of organised crime-crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder as well as robbery and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Since summer 2016, the Prosecution has established Constance against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">For this reason, the large-scale deployment was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The aim of the investigation was mainly Italian citizens with close relation to the Italian mafia.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Also a incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to go to the bank's account.</seg>

<seg id="1230">Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious misdecision in case of asylum procedures and deportations, in an analysis that the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" has given.</seg>
<seg id="1231">According to the data register, according to data, ten million people with foreign citizenship are reported, including approximately 5.7 million from non-EU countries.</seg>

<seg id="1238">Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently begun sending refugee families back to Italy with less than 16 year old children when they have arrived from there.</seg>
<seg id="1239">This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung."</seg>
<seg id="1240">In the paper, it is said that the BAMF is conducting such procedures on families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017. "</seg>

<seg id="1265">The Bank's political decision-makers (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members in this month pursuing an increase, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In its quarterly inflation forecast, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on budgetary income would continue, with inflation likely to rise to just under 3% in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1267">But it signalised that in the coming years interest increases would be needed to curb the inflation-heated inflation and said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">Members also agreed to withdraw part of the mammoth economic stimulus package published a year ago after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financing for banks from the coming February, although it was said that it is now expected to provide €15 billion more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.</seg>
<seg id="1270">The Bank said: "in the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">At the rate of interest, it repeated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "somewhat larger" extent than the markets would expect.</seg>

<seg id="1273">The Bank however stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."</seg>
<seg id="1274">The Bank's growth forecasts revised down below for this year and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It maintained its growth forecast of 1.8% in 2018.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September following a high-court fight against the funding of the medicine in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">NHS England announced that pretext proposition prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being supplied by health services via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1293">He agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed last year that the Supreme Court of Appeal confirmed that the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance him.</seg>
<seg id="1294">The Chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as "crucial moment."</seg>
<seg id="1295">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to make the registration of people possible, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1296">Pretext prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection hazards.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep prior to having intercourse means that just enough medication exists in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such drugs may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In clinics, suitable participants are identified to agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also opt-in for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The programme is signed by £10 million and NHS Great Britain signed a contract to supply medicines this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "" "" "Stevens said:" "" "" "" "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">"" "" "" "it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of mankind's greatest health challenges." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1307">Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Prep, if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="1309">From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many lives.</seg>
<seg id="1310">"" "" "" "we warmly welcome this announcement." "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1311">Ian Green, CEO of the Higgins Trust, said: "the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind.</seg>
<seg id="1312">Now that prep test medicine has been procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV. "</seg>
<seg id="1313">Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation by the government.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the Big Life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced itself to an Earls Court Apartment in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an mezzanine to make optimum use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12,5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create an attic in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works are quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "" "" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">By exercising a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a bit of engineer art went in," "" "" "" "explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's counter-important so that when you push the door high, it glides very easily." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain extra 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the base - or how your property is estimated," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space while simultaneously using high-quality materials that give the room its luxury advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and which help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you do not love electrical sockets in the walls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "" "" "these are important, but they do not play with your heart." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter value of something standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, as Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar property-empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers spent four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate imperialist Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to let him clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with Anna's mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties in the value of more than half a billion dollars, since the family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood since 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the family founded Westco jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 to 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the cityscape, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the family De Lutis - owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file says that this means that Colin owns property of $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proven to be an issue for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the press releases suggested by Colin have left him with what I kept for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled out him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but proposes Paul to competently manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my Italian legacy states that the family is the most important priority," "" "" "" "he wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, among them Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood estate in which Colin opened the first jeans of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property with their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land on trial," "" "" "" "she wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, but Colin claims that Mark has paid $10 million and Luke 26 million when leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "" "" "both Luke and Mark were," "" "" "" "Paul says" "" "" "" "about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin was very withheld although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of television.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "" "" "only Colin answered by SMS to say" "" "" "" "I really can't say much," "" "" "" "because the case is before the courts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad, that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother's demands.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," "" "" "" "he said, and added that he" still hope for a solution. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more regular course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior executives on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to fix: poor information that came into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information should flow around him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if Miss Trump was upset because of unfair tax reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to convince him," said the former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February opposite Politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "" "" "Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "" "" "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter practice is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lobbying price." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "" "" "but the idea that" "" "" "" "under control" "" "" "" "tingmumps is ridiculous." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps those campuses know something we don't know others - that the tweets without their interventions would have included more combustible material.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep him away from him several times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to bring forward their own agenda by presenting Trump materials that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to provide questionable information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cliques, especially those with embarrassing leaks, and that he will figure out where they come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone illegally released a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of Staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been permanently banished from Twitter because of chicanes or that he has offered no concrete evidence, or that he has given false accusations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "" "" "Trump read the article and started to ask employees about Walsh." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the county, the hotel building was offered to the administrative office as an accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.</seg>

<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reported that there are already first invitations of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between the firstborn son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to have purposefully mingled in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between the pumps elective campaign team and Moscow.</seg>

<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also took a close look at more and more drumps in private and business environments.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the investigator Trump has personally moved into the centre and forearns the accusation that the President may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to check this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to raise the charges.</seg>
<seg id="1490">As a result, Grand Jurys are also called anchor chains.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are usually switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>

<seg id="1494">According to the broadcaster CNN, invitations were issued, turning around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election campaign Paul Manafort joined the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in U.S. television that the enforcement shows that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary he should act fast.</seg>

<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the setting of the board was the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Amid the new revelations, the President took advantage of a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents.</seg>

<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about the release of Trump Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair surrounding the later retired president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on urging the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>

<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the west Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has loosened from the scarcely seven-times size of Berlin from the ice shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The Koloss, which weighs over a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres, will now push northwards and probably will take two or three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent climate change has played a role in the abort of the ice age, according to research data, it is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">All in all, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factor background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was a part of the Larsen-C-Shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">As a result, it grows further into the sea and breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this ice shelf the balance of waxing and breaking was disturbed several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete ice shelf can be traced there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">I am talking about the fact that the Larsen-C-Shelf is in danger, as the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate is under tension and can be broken, if a piece is broken down at a key spot.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of ice shelf and icebergs does not increase the level of sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it produces after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf shows that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project to monitor the Antarctic (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth-largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now entering a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "" "" "he also confirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Under scientists he argued whether the Larsen C Schelfeis will now grow back or fall back in the long run and possibly collapsed, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not lead the breakage of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many of the icebelfs of the Antarctic Peninsula have been crushed in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctica stretches from South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has been warmed around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus tame to the areas where the temperature increases the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU calls to withdraw from the employers' association in order to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break the Reichstag gained 41 new jobs in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the county administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have left their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers in the circle are apparently highly sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Approximately 620 applications were recorded for the places to be published this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the group is still lacking staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present there are still 50 unoccupied places in the district of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU is now planning to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "" "" "after the request of the parties, the administration will develop" "" "" "" "a concept for recruitment and personnel development." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate itself internally and externally, show specific measures for cross-beginners and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "" "" "the speech is" "" "" "" "competition of public employers" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees who are leaving the ministry for disease or age reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1569">So high time for action so that there are no more places to remain vacant.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, group leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common proposal with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had long been working on a rotten surprise in the crayon day when he questioned the number of personnel costs and amazed the other parties.</seg>

<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the county administration should aim with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - a house tariff," so peoples.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this way, the CDU tries to pay better the employees and officials when it actually foresees Tarifordnung for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money only exists if you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards career years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Act.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Councillor Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy aggravates the tone on NGO migrants' rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean if they are not allowed to continue on new rules for their operations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German aid organization 'Youth Rettet' because their crew effectively collaborated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year now, refused to express itself on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," "" "" "" "said the organization in an opinion on the social media." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we can judge all accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and evaluate the situation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew takes on board boat migrants aboard, which are delivered to them directly by human traffickers, and that smugglers can depart, so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of being overthrown by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must first have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not involve any "significant changes or disabilities" of their rescue operations.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz region, to enjoy trials and sightseeings for four days.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal turned out to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest from Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could see far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream levels.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there was again and again longer ascents, for the long trials bellowed.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the folk festival in Wurstmarkt.</seg>

<seg id="1615">This has also recognized the first German lignages that are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-sport department in mid-July and joined two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.</seg>

<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the soccer simulation of FIFA will be challenged at a competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, Ligen have long since become established in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asian games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it really a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Also Ingo Frobond has long been dealing with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses that can also be found in the classic sport - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, I need cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction to responsiveness.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console, but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition.</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case seems to be a legal precedent since there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to challenge another to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case drew national attention after Carters revealed text messages, encouraging him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang yourself, hop on a building, stand up for yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.</seg>

<seg id="1726">It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, as Eveline Lemke (Grüne) was still an economic minister of Rhineland-Palatinate.</seg>
<seg id="1727">This shows after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer companies (VTU), says: "Wisser seizes the desires of the economy, which has all blocked Lemke."</seg>
<seg id="1730">The biggest reversal of the turnaround looks natural in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the priority list of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1731">This year, the Ministry hopes for a scheduling process, until 2021 the construction law will stand.</seg>
<seg id="1732">A role in the plans of the country also plays the western circumstance of Trier, which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan.</seg>
<seg id="1733">The goal is to put the track into operation in December 2020, says Cornelia Holtmann.</seg>
<seg id="1734">Natus sees in it a sign to support regional, but internationally competing companies.</seg>
<seg id="1735">As von Wensing, the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier is aiming for a Rhineland-Palatinate-Label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW-chairman said the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the companies as a callback.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides, emit diesel engines, are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of automotive manufacturers to install equipment for neutralising diesel-driven exhaust gases also increases, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of renouncing the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called depreciation devices that regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but return to normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">Several Volkswagen employees were indicted in the United States, others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from shipping and could be tried in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accuse Audi to have installed a system to circumvent the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request that concentrated on the United States was expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The inclusion of Audi into the study could seriously burden Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributed disproportionately to the gain of Volkswagen.</seg>

<seg id="1776">Mordillos Knollennasen and the laughter against the suffering</seg>
<seg id="1777">Mordillo was one of the most publicized cartoon draftsmen, and his characters are his trademark.</seg>

<seg id="1779">"" "" "" "his message: laughter," "" "" "" "for there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first few years as an artist he proposed himself as a drawing for congratulation cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," "" "" "" "he said once." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, the breakthrough came to an end in the sixties: with the release of his cartoons in Paris Match, and then also in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Big, roundish Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his own data, he still sits at the drawing table, working daily almost ten hours.</seg>
<seg id="1788">About calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and watches continue to find its cute figures worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">For six years he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his figures.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos any animal in his drawings - which has a thousand-footer as a counter-player.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and insect-borne insects, which causes scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions, causing great headache.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert on the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "lavender in Provence is effectively jeopardized because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years and much more in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small icad, a microbibacterium that transmits the dwarf cycades, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil attracts tourists not only, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse added: "instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weak.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="1807">The point of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a middle age festival.</seg>

<seg id="1809">Assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat to Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodoce normally meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the latest mayhem in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and unceasing drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they are to take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and stomach feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no silence of violence, and while the bodies are piling up throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589 are under attack and threats under federal protection and until now, there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "" "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which show his smile on his face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Special Attorney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">Like most thousands of murders committed every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In the case of Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is even more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "as long as we don't know the Why, we mistrust everybody." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15th May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He just managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and he was shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated into the "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter ran away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing to silence about Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drug kingdoms bigger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed vein-members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for its own security following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He served as an experienced journalist for North America in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "" "" "in Sinaloa," "" "" "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the toxicity problem," "" "" "" "said Bojorquez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting examinations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors-Cabot Award" for reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He willingly admitted that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "" "" "he said at the CPJ Award." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "" "" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "" "" "is a way of life," "" "" "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompviento TV." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take over the task which is ascribed to you as a journalist - either that or you are playing the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "" "" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team miss Valdez, the Spaßvogel that could curse like a port worker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "" "" "now they ask," "" "" "" "Is his love for routine his destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and runways" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, there were suddenly no cell phones allowed. days before was known that Spyware, which was sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class neighbourhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters were asking if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the policemen, who the governor himself described as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has stained on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was assassination of the brother of the former well-known xer, Julio Cesar Chavez, in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to government spending, which concentrated on the hometown of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a souvenir sheet from the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which reigned nearly the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this location, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months earlier, the readers had viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source about kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"we used to have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now all channels of communication are broken with our sources." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Journalist Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to the office of the prosecutor's office the following morning.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body has been discovered and officials say that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become louder throughout the country by typing them in organized protests "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has asked since then that she is regrouped by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a uniform society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces committed to organised crime under a blanket.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"" "" "" "last year, the media coverage group" "" "" "" "Articulo 19" "" "" "" "has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by Zetas cartel: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones were in addition to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close, as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as El Manana did in Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a editorial on the title page "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and look for danger.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.</seg>

<seg id="1912">At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat at the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to buzz.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shootings with rivals and security forces near the Mazatlan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated further as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the curb's edge, they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens howling nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez took a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were in readiness.</seg>

<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first glance it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well received that they could even realize that his flaky skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "restless past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in "Current Biology" described it as "the upholstered dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous Period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well preserved condition amazes researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk as he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2.500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy ground.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have discovered that these herbivores, though covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage in order to hide from predators and used a shielding technique, which is known as counter-coating, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to mingle better with its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, experts say what indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines for the first time in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shadowing, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shady is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs were hunted by enough pressure through carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favoured the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter shadowing - think of deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signals that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been of the Cretaceous Age," Brown said. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal in terms of his life, including his preserved bowel content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, got into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank to the sea floor on his back.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much further inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved scaly skin but remains intact in three dimensions and maintains the original form of animal," "" "" "" "said Brown." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early Cretaceous period." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous Age was a time when huge Thermopodes, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, went through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, who lived tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the current biology journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumbled in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk as he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the upholstered dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that raked from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant-eater was swept through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the rearming of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved, that the house-stallions still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is so rare as a profit in the lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right shoulder is on his side, his five fingers are spread to the top.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at his sole.</seg>

<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-München (A8) some 20 people were injured in a mass arambolage on Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the police, at 5pm between the interfacing stations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) were almost 30 vehicles during a thunderstorm, among them probably trucks, in a row.</seg>
<seg id="1976">There is no indication of the exact number of the wounded.</seg>

<seg id="1978">A large array of rescue vehicles was at the side of the accident.</seg>

<seg id="1980">In the direction of direction Munich, an approximately ten kilometres long back-traffic was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As a AZ-reporter reported, there also came to massive disabilities on the back-track - through numerous Gaffer.</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group testing "Comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing is stuck in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deeply involved in his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffed.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the conductor and wakes up an unsushaped or snaps the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket inspections.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the perfect map control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you can take your seat and validate your ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, a test operation runs on two tracks.</seg>

<seg id="1999">In order to be able to use it, however, some requirements must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You also have to buy it via the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>

<seg id="2004">The test customers then have a button for electronic devaluation.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that Passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seating position Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train attendant arrives at the ticket inspection at PLAY, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, work on, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - which in turn is to use the passenger.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train attendant, simply check out the DB Navigator yourself.</seg>

<seg id="2013">Because often you have, in any case, one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents you need for the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or ID card is missing, or any other document you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and passenger, leading to a bad mood in the part or greater space and delays in the control of one's own ticket and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this applies only to ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Other train numbers on the same track are not yet unlocked.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolls through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post from someone from High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the police just killed an 18-year old child, and it is still on the streets," "" "" "" "he said there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, since no one else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., to tweet live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He postulated a picture of Brown's leaved body, stretched out on the street and staying there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "that's wild," "" "" "" "Ferrell thought with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She stopped her cell phone in order to return to the Canfield-Drive in the evening after tweets.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police and people crying, and by a man who claimed to be Brown's father who carried a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed in which a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "" "" "in another video, she said, another policeman captured his rifle and cried:" "" "" "" "I will kill you... animals all." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is not common," "" "" "" "Ferrell remembered her statement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment, I felt shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 11pm she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the topic of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the people's point of view, who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower-dress and a matching crown, the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" "" "" "" "she remembered what she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are now going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">"" "" "" "I couldn't take them with me," "" "" "" "Ferrell said later." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2046">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "what has happened today is a peak of what happened in the past." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be raised therein.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I'm lucky enough to give her an experience, in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "" "" "I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take form for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after August 9," she said, and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, the President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It's all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, just wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "" "" "a question came from Ferrell in the mind:" "" "" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently declared in an interview: "we heard people who were born and raised in Ferguson were not centered and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan already worked together with the former Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt-dwellers.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His involvement brought the project closer to Ferrell, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we're talking," "" "" "" "said Davis." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this was the main thing for me as these people are portrayed, for that is how I shall be portrayed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrer's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "" "" "Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanisation of black people." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who have shaped the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media after killing the black teenager, Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "" "" "black, gay women must bear the burden of everything." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "" "" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "" "" "the movement really is held by black women and many black women." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action," when Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although it was at the forefront because in a life at these crossroads as a black, gay woman standing so much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">"" "" "" "you can feel their energy through the screen." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she clings to a chant and she feels indebted to that memory since she went on the street three years ago in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is our duty to fight for our freedom." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV-readers discuss bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people, even though it hasn't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population in proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">There is hardly any cold in the subject.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit gallery says: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "don't need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents are building a gallery to attract more customers to the city, including the rest of the shops, the opponents are afraid that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is being planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands in which 13 direct marketing companies offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work, it will end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been shopping for many years almost weekly in the Farmers Market Hall.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the mermaids love again and again.</seg>

<seg id="2109">One can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a decent weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mainly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown ones, which are almost imperceptibly similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen bands and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth's prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year sentence after being secretly drawn up diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming resemblance (a matching resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline entailed her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transcript and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama, when he only had three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg originated from the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how anyone could look with these genomic data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since its puberty, was convicted in 2013 because of 20 charges, including six violations of the law of espionage, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">The prison was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white selfie in which Manning deliberately sits unwell on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just out of the big success of her 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, by extracting the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg on a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated mice became an unequal letter of friendship, which, over the course of two years, exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo's illustrated Comic "Suppressed Images," which foresaw a future in which the President of Chelsea would transform their verdict and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was published to demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to continue to flaring up the rigid splits he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about all these things after the strange timing, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning requested with her superlarge signature (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, which is based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how astonishing, at least in biological respects, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video-Werk from 2007, Spell Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novels.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, as she appears with a hands-free phone in his hand from the United States "discipline in disciplinary sanctions, such as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when they get cold, they have won" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "" "" "" "said the artist who greets from Philadelphia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I still get goosebumps when I talk about it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but when it was supposed to do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacres that meet like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning Stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits.</seg>

<seg id="2158">University of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University because of Killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide human hunting is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at the University of Oxford who are looking for suspects after a man has been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by the acts of the Local Court of Cook County.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stabs.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene of the events, and detective investigates the stitches as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said civil servants.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubbage, the Vice President for University Relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now in a state of absence and excluded from entering the Campus of Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is now a criminal affair being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University co-operates with this investigation," "" "" "" "said Cubbage." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2169">A spokesman at the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigative authorities in any way possible."</seg>
<seg id="2170">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urge the suspects to face the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves," "" "" "" "said Guglielmi." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, who said that something had happened in Apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as being very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">Security cameras confirmed that they were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "" "" "" "said Guglielmi." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2181">Russian vice-president Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, Rusada has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2183">"" "" "" "the WADA schedule has been updated in this respect," "" "" "" "said Mutko on Thursday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of WADA's schedule to comply with the code describing the criteria for re-initiation of Rusada and recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he doesn't contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>

<seg id="2187">"" "" "" "and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "" "" "" "he added." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">One of the criteria listed in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren for alleged publicly funded doping in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "" "" "in terms of the matter, Mutko said," "" "" "" "We carry out the inquiry because our anti-doping system has made a mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "" "" "but there were no government programmes and we will not admit anything that does not exist." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">Talking to Russian sales office rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov published issues of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">"" "" "" "no one has to accept this report unconditionally," "" "" "", "added Smirnov." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2195">Rusada was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of doping scandal from the WADA on the implementation of doping controls in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your e-commerce-start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there was never any consistency and objectivity," "" "" "" "said Errett who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to carry out surveys, provide specialized groups and demographic groups, allow employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, whistleblowers to circumvent executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can drill out why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that there must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next deputator involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post which describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken will be punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as GLINT, this wish is a lucrative possibility after an overview.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, who helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber Fall in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">CH has almost 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Convercent companies can send bespoke "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat-cards of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the chief executive officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company finds its employees badly treated or behaved unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycotts, employee turnover and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites, Convercent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, if an employee wished to issue a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the discomfort of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company Convercent employs, problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or countries - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice - can be identified and addressed faster.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," "" "" "" "said Vitrano, who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies started taking Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen broke down because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "" "" "but it took until the" "" "" "" "social media came to their right" "" "" "" "that businesses realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Converters offer your software as a service, and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Cent was awarded $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glittering secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, given the connected nature of businesses, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research showing that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"when people are happy to be in a company feel that their voices heard and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this business successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who used both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors gain margins when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If third party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts in workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks staff for your feedback, it may have a expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change doesn't come quickly enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you have more than 4,000 suggestions, you must be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "because if you don't follow employees wonder," "" "" "" "Have you really heard me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Are you concerned about that?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "" "" "and if you don't care about why should I?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about GLINT, so rett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated staff, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights on employees, and hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector known for high sales.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," "" "" "" "said Vitrano." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2257">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and if you lose people, you also lose customers." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2260">It starts at 11pm when a lot of UCLA footballers talk on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some pulled off their tricot parts and show the back of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.</seg>

<seg id="2264">"this is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before the Monday was on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of the players, and she has actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should begin at 7: 15 p.m. to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise between the two days is more than a day at which the Bruins shifted the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras performed practical exercises in Westwood for the first time.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his recent past, Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a sip for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980-er.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Beware River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a predilection for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "" "" "he says vehemently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2294">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story has been illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Handiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly found emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumbprint on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumbprint!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell of smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were also there.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is smitten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I have overlooked my welcome-greeting a little") all this seems too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyenas on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape patrons, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank "whiskey and started to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just began to look after the archive that he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it down onto the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of the English empire, cards that represented who possessed: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch fighting the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let all go their gear! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse in the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revolt of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a rebellion which occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes says.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the peasant revolt began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2337">Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army</seg>
<seg id="2338">Each year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirement and promotion in the officer corps in Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So this week too.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance a normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine among the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff, as before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">The five vice-presidents and the Minister of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the deliberations.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government is dragging the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commander of the army, the forces of air and the navy were dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as a magnet for the coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2349">For 486 persons involved in the coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the coup attempt as a "gift of God," given him the opportunity to "fully cleanse the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really handle the army?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the heading "Unease in the military headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamisation" of the army which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the headscarf ban for soldiers, wrote the paper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The grand pursuit of the army and the security forces is still going on.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan ordered another 7395 citizen, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were earlier than the lords of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they putted their role as sentinels of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least on appeal to the reform proposals of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is targeting the Islamisation of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the "Vocal Europe" magazine, a notably not-named officer, who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt, would be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.</seg>
<seg id="2362">If this is true, such a development could not allow NATO to be cold.</seg>

<seg id="2373">Ministry wants route for race-up shuttle</seg>
<seg id="2374">Over the past few months over the future of the racing shuttles has been contested - now it is to go very fast.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Even before the end of the year, the marten route, on which the tourist train rides, is to be built.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the racing shuttles in the long run, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work is to begin this year.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order and rehabilitate the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is committed to this particularly important connection," explained Minister of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The costs for the repair of the track were estimated at about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Of this sum, the country is surpassing 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, on which the shuttle should also be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalised, declared Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the South Thuringian Railways as operators are already in agreement with the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"this means that the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated," said Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The Rennsteig-Shuttle was to be ordered regularly on December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular rail link between Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations.</seg>
<seg id="2386">Over the past few months, a pilot operation has been tested to see if sufficient number of people will be used to order them again in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2387">The track is also very shallow in parts.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it won't be even crazier in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, professor for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we have to begin to take her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will get them to see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern scouts have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his convictions, and select everything from the eye color of the robot via the form of nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it will be worrying as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepper woman look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot enables users, for example, to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personages like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of timidity and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as much as possible," "" "" "" "enthuses True Companion's website." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">She also has her moods in the course of the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "" "" "she can be tired, be fixated on conversation or she can be" in mood "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - last but not least because they are replacing real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape if one goes a step on Frigid (is called: reluctant) Farrah allocates one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, True Companion Roxxxy was compatible with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing sophistication point to something dark and deeper in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR remembers their growing popularity, they still remain at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what permeates the boundary areas can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots would appear at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has been praising women to be sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most dreadful aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report Of The Servants') is not the graphic images, the enforced body and the engraved eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical resemblance to real women as realistically as possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, to the point when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the Speech of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Pumps Big Power?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of the common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump-wisdom of the Trump-era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving in the USA there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump selectable relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all ostensibly exert ourselves to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power to bring down the power of mumps, families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, has visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House anyone who knows them, including the Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite strange on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="2433">For the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but I notice in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The Left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the spooky way that his kittens won't bump us any more someday.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the Right Wing "normalize" that suddenly appear as the notion of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomical version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur to one as very mild offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump moves, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York parking department's carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crawling and the animals are twisted to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatic music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are getting old, the skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count, but a large roundabout in Northern London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-carousel is still a strange magical experience, since here two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women can walk on it in the 40s and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the evaluation with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowing down of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologizing, while I was tired of making her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar pistorius with chest pain moved out of prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was taken to hospital for the treatment of cuts in his wrist, which he suffered according to a case in his cell after a fall.</seg>
<seg id="2452">On account of murder, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>

<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - taking notice of the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a familiarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach works for the administrative community as the Lower Building Law Authority, the applicant has to report corresponding conclusions.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result from this.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have made a connection between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an diet rich in tryptophan favours a more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also plays in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral student, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, examined a kind of immune cell that encourages tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribal, but which was separated, did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastro-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice were sequenced in DNA and six species of bacteria were found which were present in mice with the immune cells but lacking in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria were working on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri were able to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as the Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us are protecting L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote as these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potential high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2715">The White House's decision to fly a South Lawn marine helicopter for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers according to military records that were left to TIME Magazin to $24,000.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter, which was manufactured in Connecticut, was on display next to a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin firefighter car and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superiors, the deputy naval commander for aeronautics.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 3 pm and so long remained until the grass was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of the hours, a second crew would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the plane during the time on the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal states to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Datasets indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate the purpose.</seg>

<seg id="2729">The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But even official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event, the President gave an impulse to reform the health reform that was under way in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter down on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not maintain budget labels for presidential aerations, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>

<seg id="2745">The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen's report lists Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburg Domspatzen's report on misuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Domspatzen provides further discussions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are church," declared after publication in comparison with the German Press Agency, he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false assessment of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican paper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised that in reporting on violence in the Domspatzen, "double standards" would be measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is a "shameful and shameful deed" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future. however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, "says the writer Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethic committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it as normal" "" "" "", "writes Scaraffia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "you would like to go to the church and that is a devout fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "" "" "she also pointed out that" "" "" "" "blows have been a normal educational means" "" "" "" "to deal with naughty children as I was one." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you find it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, as the world has changed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of misuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">The author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the "My Brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger, writes (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly does the 440-page report commissioned by the diocese Regensburg to Enlightenment Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the diocese Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that in many cases Domkapellmeister has applied forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Even with a high degree of emotionality, punishment for the students could also be more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to many other accused, however, many victims claim that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R., and that is why in many cases, despite violence, many of them even combine positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Ezemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal of the Regensburger Domspatzen, Georg Ratzinger, relieved his mind.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence doing violence at the Regensburger Domspatzen," presents a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "" "" "for one, many students highlight his" "" "" "" "humanity." "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, which was palpable by the economist when a domain sparrow did not bring top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long story from the front to the rear, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is found in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Only eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly exempted from any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The principality of violence at the preschool was also outside its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best it is possible to reproach him, to learn from it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, on which it worked, was felt as literally "salvation," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his pupils, Georg Ratzinger, also testifies as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to abrupts.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he didn't just pop with chairs and cast the key on the floor, but also shared ear candy and pulled too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself acknowledged even years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for this.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the time, 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it actually is about in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the use of violence in the pre-school, these are admittedly bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Then one wonders if it is not more likely to do with his fame and his role as Brother Benedict XVI that many media have just rushed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him at the Bavarian pope are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">"" "" "" "but the truth is:" "" "" "" "the report lists Georg Ratzinger in every way!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, a great deal was reported about abuse during the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the final report, Georg Ratzinger is also accused of any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted itself to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother," "" "" "" "it was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even confide themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a leader who had been a colleague of the perpetrator professionally.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger evaluate the role in terms of the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a sought-after pupil phrased it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd, to assume that... Buben would have opened more forceful or clearer, or even more, than against their parents, dormitory leaders, trustworthy teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "the report concludes with the very clear result:" "" "" "" "the students and / or their surroundings affected him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the study." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus free from any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of having not prevented or brought him to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to connect his good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "" "" "in the media there was a lot to read about" "" "" "" "violence" "" "" "" "among the Regensburger Domspatzen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister, Georg Ratzinger, is accused of "looking away" in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything is mixed up in the reporting and blended into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is namely, neatly separated: between the pre-school and the grammar school of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrendous test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers were really harassed and portrayed, and suffered from them all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the other hand, as most of the witnesses pointed out, the topic of "pre-school" was taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline indeed, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases even have positive memories with him despite violence."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, it remains the reproach to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just begun to establish himself and was in charge of the forerunner at a school where he had just not worked and was responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently engulf ears from the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "" "" "in this he points out this," "" "" "" "that the primary school will continue to practice the punishment." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended an urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as the test punishments were banned in Bavaria long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that she took place in a legal grey area, as everyone knows of us yet.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the concerned might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This simply is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the examination of schools in Bavaria was officially abolished.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis stated that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the "pitfall of anachronism," so the danger of judging the past in accordance with today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable and not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all awful and I am happy that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its means to discipline and punish, so to slap ear-eyes and on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As physical punishment was forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "" "" "which picture of its Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger shown in the talks with you for the book" "" "" "" "My Brother of the Pope" "" "" "" "?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic of testing also come to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, since the Domspatzen played only a supporting role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't even conceal that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this has to be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trance from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonbons alone, one does not even make a big singer and stand before any success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "what kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger in talking to her book?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I have met Georg Ratzinger thoroughly and again and again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and hearty people, of whom one can't imagine that he could do something for a fly too.</seg>
<seg id="2989">As many former Domspatzen, I receive regular contact with him today, 23 years after his appointment, visit him, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until today, that he once was stern to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral-cats today are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but also a lovable respect, to which she is still looking at and honoring her.</seg>
<seg id="2993">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and please, once more clearly," "" "" "" "What you reproach him are educational methods that were on the order of the day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that is behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for the report that has just been published releases it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the starting point would be a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and maybe even Germany nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
