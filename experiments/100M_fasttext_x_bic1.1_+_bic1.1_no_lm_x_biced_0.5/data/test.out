28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who has recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went up with him again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lei@@ ch@@ n@@ am found on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ ic@@ ia from San Francisco who shared the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are running .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia , announced the ABS Sender K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about his death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia admitted that Frank was initially living in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
joining his style with his family was to cook us always a little , to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confron@@ tation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that sh@@ ined every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the execution phone of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I will always be put in drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made Hollywood star un@@ ambig@@ uous in an interview now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or stuck from outside label , which have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather like me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her as &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan .
most of all , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of the television with a delicious de@@ bris and Mexican food , it is called in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White gl@@ ut brings the question to the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film will take place on August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger ob@@ tains the pyramid of sports
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited with some colleagues a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their work , they hun@@ ted back home to the feed in a quick g@@ allo@@ p .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and thus the riding career finished already again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament vic@@ tories - was again close to horses .
he let himself lead with his family about the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even s@@ well for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid handed over the gold sports pyramid to the man from An@@ hausen in the course of a small gala .
there is no lack of awards for the sympath@@ etic sport@@ sman .
League Cross , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only awarded for sporting successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring .
and so he also received the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports .
the winners include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the real Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander Pus@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the ro@@ wer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the bo@@ ar rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand@@ ball Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of those sport@@ s@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company mig@@ rated to the jumping arena where the Lav@@ azza price was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept the distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ umps Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade deal - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump want to .
however , the two US presidential candidates are not one in the tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a more basic philosophical difference .
that , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep this in doubt rather small and warns of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be completely different , claims tr@@ ump .
he will massi@@ vely rep@@ el regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for enterprises .
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks ; it has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances to open up and needs money for it .
that is why taxes for the rich would increase , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in which must be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost say word @-@ synchron@@ ized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic candidate is even announ@@ cing the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are rejected by the state @-@ critical te@@ ap@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans .
so on tr@@ ump there could still be party @-@ internal discussions .
distin@@ ctions are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
oil production is also to be possible in previously protected areas , it wants to announce the Paris climate protection agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its investment programme , Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand renewable energies and demand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign both . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better .
they should be paid better , Clinton says .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wage .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says he cannot be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics suggest that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand Clinton , who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who has fled has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing themselves .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ sed .
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each has a baby with a maximum of one year old .
one has put her little son in his arms .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she not@@ ices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until you speak with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is an area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are chicken .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for fully @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs has set up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Assistance .
recently , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as a visitor either .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are politically persec@@ uted because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; send them to Europe as hope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in women , there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they do not see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country they have had experience with sexual violence , co@@ er@@ ci@@ on , hon@@ orary mor@@ als , slavery , or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
on the escape this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believe that as soon as they arrived in Germany , B@@ ahr re@@ counts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used at worst .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the Munich north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ sed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they do not dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , they need more accommodation just for them , ask B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their sphere of competence , some respond with no . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia there is no such thing in accommodations of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia , refugees alone are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in the Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are in some common shel@@ ters floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation units exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack the privacy or will men and women stay together , it may become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first of all the wash@@ rooms should be separated and for women easily accessible , is in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be seen at the rush that it gives to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since you have been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
denti@@ sts strike : demands for new work combat measures
deputy members of the Regist@@ rar have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new work campaign measures in their disputes concerning a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work campaign measures from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC testi@@ fied that ministers had s@@ worn to address the concerns about the treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assist@@ ants and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was rejected by 58 % of its members voted in favor of the elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the members who was posted on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained &quot; har@@ r@@ ingly quiet &quot; to problems , which led to the rejection of the treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and request official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC executive board today adopted a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating work campaign measures that commen@@ ce at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that Regist@@ rar fought six times this year , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of BM@@ A , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed terms of contract recommended by the BM@@ A .
he informed the BM@@ A members during the meetings , which were before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistant doctors and medical students , with the fact that the contract was advantageous and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for doctors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and pro@@ claim an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile was nar@@ ro@@ li@@ pp@@ ly and he barely exu@@ ded warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report a whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory remarks : the down@@ stream of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to that time was rage @-@ burning .
Putin announced and accused Ankara of having fallen in the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater since it was committed by a supposed friend .
re@@ building the ve@@ to is difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officers that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin obtained the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia could make a sort of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan needs primarily all the friends he can get after spending the last month with a failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat of almost his office .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also sho@@ cked him .
but there are economic motives too .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved if the flights are res@@ um@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ east@@ ward rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this week the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish ag@@ r@@ arian imports are allowed again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious on the West as it regards its response to the attempted transfer of power as a weak response .
to this end , the continued gru@@ dge on the gastro@@ ent@@ emp@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
in Ankara , the Russian head of state secured a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described to me : two countries that have been viol@@ ated and badly treated by the West and are now alli@@ ed .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents at the press conference expressed that they hadn &apos;t even understood the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to stress that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State will at least talk to each other .

according to the Bank &apos;s Head of Management , the R@@ BS brand is only to be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has since dis@@ soci@@ ated itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this time , brand strateg@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to focus more national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and stock exchange go to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for retail banking that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor stamp and the brand under which our employees will be busy as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals but local targets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will not continue its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to move to the bank of the brands , because how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the CEO .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori gains its 3,@@ 000@@ th prize at New@@ market at Pre@@ vention
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double in New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th win
Jo@@ ckey , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori , secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he placed a milestone on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second prize of the night on his local rac@@ et@@ rack .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won at G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar before , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I was here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori respon@@ ds to the che@@ er when he takes the victory on his pre@@ condition
two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in obstacle racing - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 vic@@ tories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career badge
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone , which only a few have achieved before him .
he has style and is strong , but its tac@@ tical intel@@ lect differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans have been enthusiastic about this sport for years .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and grand tournament jo@@ ckey !
in the UK , Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden almost 30 years of winner , which is great .
he has a vivid personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fig@@ ure@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of grand tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ fy his doubts and return to his best form .
and he hasn &apos;t come to the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 50 years of age .
Russia &apos;s Putin mo@@ ist Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov chief of staff
Russian President Vladimir Putin recently dism@@ issed Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov &apos;s Chief of Staff .
Ivan@@ ov was part of Putin &apos;s nar@@ ro@@ west trust group for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special commission@@ er for environmental and transport matters .
in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , Putin stated that without stating reasons &quot; the dism@@ iss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a deputy director since 2012 , was named his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo emb@@ assy .
on the Krem@@ lin website it means ( in Russian ) that he later became protocol director and head of the government son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said about his appointment to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activity as Head of State in respect of bills and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin announced on Friday the Russian TV broad@@ c@@ aster that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the sm@@ iling faces convinced ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ants for a long time and works as he was for the Soviet Intelligence Service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men asser@@ ted that the Chief of Staff resig@@ ns at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , just a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is this the consequence of a sort of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official statement - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin , which are quoted on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - I could almost say - tru@@ sting - bur@@ sting posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration since four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin served as President of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov became his deputy .
when Putin arrived at power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted the most .
it was once assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term of office , as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another , approaching ally Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president for three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after beating producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced its termination in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed before the announcement of his dism@@ iss@@ al .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character of Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , will be published according to the statement of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios at a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g was part of the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and have put my whole heart in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be part of it , but that will not be possible now .
I would like to thank the writers , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth Season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a Ban@@ ff citizen called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale could act , which were sp@@ iced out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone might shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : crossing the River with Fi@@ fe
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ bury cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four clos@@ ings to the &quot; deck blo@@ wer &quot; approaching each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 obli@@ que ropes .
the project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ bury cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
all in all , nearly 79 % of the bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete deck in Ros@@ y@@ th for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager at For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first fast@@ ener represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the North tower deck , we had to close the gap to the north or agricultural side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern tribut@@ ary bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
massive because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards with an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
as the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , they were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately , everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown out of their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station proposed an alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming as their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat rolling around and made us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of its range until we left it , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ oy without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the board@@ walk and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Jones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have happiness un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot motor had a stop@@ pl@@ ine , but it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone watches over these men today .
seriously injured - a man stab@@ bed to his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police informed yesterday , the 50 year old received the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcoholic off@@ ender cuts the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in the hands and on the body .
the police arrested the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother .
he then al@@ armed his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ life partner .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old sho@@ ok his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
who builds favourable apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be more strongly engaged in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 affordable apartments over the next few years ?
the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; living room concept for living &quot; at the next council meeting .
but quar@@ rel is programmed .
first of all , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
the leader of the SPD , Christoph Brat@@ mann , believes : &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; if you want to build on urban areas , in future 20 percent of all apartments must be dealt with as social housing . &quot;
the cheap apartments can , however , also arise in the inventory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the main point in the town hall was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but build as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing construction programme that will cost millions and is still being financed will provide incentives for incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U aims to provide investors with as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder conditions for investors .
regardless of what kind of Brat@@ mann , an intensi@@ fication of the situation on the housing market appears .
if the concept of action is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the programme is not yet entirely : because the roughly 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
how can we compare the loss of other around 1300 affordable housing units , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , according to Nicole Palm , planning policy spokesperson should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of bringing homes back into price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved at one blow .
because in the western part of the year , the end of the year runs out .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for affordable apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations .
because the number of social housing in the western part of the West is dras@@ tically increased , it is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called m@@ ashing .
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged neighbor@@ hoods in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority the CD@@ U must go with the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I have focuss@@ ed on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what doesn &apos;t mean that there is still a compromise to be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to watch the world changing .
the fact that teenagers and children are no longer going outside , but rather prefer spending their free time on screens has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about catching people from the sofa and becoming more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then vide@@ og@@ ames and last on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the publication of the game sank in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand over@@ loaded by the servers .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( using a scre@@ enshot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the j@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person puts back every day .
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which followed 3@@ 5,000 users recently , announced the Washington Post recently that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of follow @-@ up people , which train every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely looks the raw data for the increase in performance .
many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to take &quot; 30 minutes to take &quot; away from the sofa &quot; and &quot; be active every day &quot; hit de@@ af ears because many public messages are boring to health and coming from people who look mis@@ erable .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of contracting cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes , and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that is fun for them .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close friends on the hunt .
as always , there are also M@@ ür@@ rische gam@@ ers who have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what &apos;s it like ?
a breakthrough has occurred .
even if Smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be decreased with time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with assets in the real world , helping many people on the hunt to become more active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the ladies &apos; bath
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all of this .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
all along line brilliant .
and now , finally , Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast er@@ red on Thursday for the combined title and aug@@ mented the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner , Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American women Simone Bal@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish bar during the Winter Olympics in Rio de Jan@@ eiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ competition title and the fifth as she consoli@@ dates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment came to an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years her sport , 15 world championships - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said that she is the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver for women in the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as excl@@ am@@ ation mark at the f@@ arewell ceremony of the team coordin@@ ator named Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although it insi@@ sted that during its long journey to the top , never planned the future , it is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ bling passport - is tailored to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coinci@@ dence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost a competition for competition , a series of vic@@ tories that will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even if Must@@ afa was easily led by two turns , the picture was dec@@ ei@@ ving .
Swedish beams and floor gymnas@@ tics - in which Bil@@ es holds the world champion title - l@@ ur@@ ked .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when she expected her end - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flo@@ wed on bil@@ es bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke passed to Must@@ afa .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old female team , called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her exercise she threw K@@ us@@ h@@ ems to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in mass mur@@ der@@ ous music while listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ ous case of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fired fire@@ arm while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police said that the triple murder was not the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the sho@@ ot@@ ings led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
altogether , seven people were killed in His@@ panic residential areas within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; says Howard of K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS at the beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting that aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but just as the fe@@ west of his age enjoyed Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t manage it .
I don &apos;t create that .
I haven &apos;t let myself down on that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course you have embar@@ ked on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to see her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund is able to walk with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund has not been able to sit or cra@@ wl up to his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund presents for &quot; Please sing something before . &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to told C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented several characters on their own .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and predi@@ ctions can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional award of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives cause for b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and large floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday . it is expected all Saturday over with more ra@@ inf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded its banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ inf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards cons@@ ented that civil servants are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the move to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags were multi@@ plying .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ho@@ a alone demanded tens of thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Satur@@ days .
the weather service allowed an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain to fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday while it was still ra@@ ining in the Mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are all likely to reach record levels throughout the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many homes near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a down@@ stream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these flows are only slowly flowing through the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the Ti@@ ck@@ f@@ w river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level at 09.@@ 00 on Friday , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still plu@@ ck people out of the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet from his house , rose strongly overnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another step @-@ in @-@ step who lives near has warned him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are awake and the water flo@@ wed and pouring in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said that in the 48 years she lived there , she never saw such a high level of the river .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the disabled and he would be the only one to swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers would have saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were accommod@@ ated by Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread rapidly , &quot; as there were still severe ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities consider evacu@@ ation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was completely absorbed by ra@@ inf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities indicated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and tuition in five bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ s .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an app@@ or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ho@@ a floo@@ ded 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , both floo@@ ded now .
the leader of Rob@@ by Miller council said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , which were washed by the floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ated people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ho@@ a , almost two dozen roads were closed due to the floo@@ ding and provided sand bags for the residents who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to become a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ess said that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses were reported to have been reported to be floo@@ ded on Thursday , but no one reported on Friday .
Keith To@@ wn@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said To@@ wn@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; enriched from bul@@ lets , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police said that the six @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents admitted that Brown suffered multiple injuries including the leg , leg , arm , and abdom@@ en , but that he was aware of his transport to the hospital .
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was en@@ chan@@ ted by bul@@ lets , &quot; said his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ de@@ z to the transmitter .
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is expected to recover .
he would have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to the C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found at the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating if there could be one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators reported C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , tra@@ ced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ saw the crime scene .
it seems that this is definitely a continuing struggle .
on the street , on both sides of the walking path , were located h@@ ul@@ ls .
so it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active involved , &quot; said police officer Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and police are currently reporting the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a s@@ layer at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a susp@@ icious one .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympic Championship in the Tur@@ ning and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , which is A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Catholic , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts has been an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America was che@@ ering .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ time world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they expected unexpected but master@@ ful Gy@@ m@@ astic routines .
on Thursday Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual competition for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see gymn@@ asi@@ ums in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to get into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last five , &quot; because the next Olympic Championship will only have four riders in the team .
but the reality looks like gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts are primarily in private gymnas@@ tics that are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these gymn@@ asi@@ ums are located in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started practicing gymnas@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to encourage the municipalities to countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , to make a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access gymnas@@ tics workout possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I founded my turn @-@ foundation 20 years ago .
at my events we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teenagers ( mainly black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong health benefits as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to take part in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the hol@@ ing of the Olympic team gold and thank you for being motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
Regist@@ rar have to organize more strikes after having rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 assistant doctors who voted for a vote rejected him .
in July Hun@@ t &apos;s plans revealed to for@@ ci@@ bly introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS was found in a &quot; ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and that any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful .
the first assist@@ ants will receive a new contract , which includes changes to bed@@ time and weekend work to improve the care of the working hours .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the Chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Regist@@ rar , announced last night in a communication with : &quot; Regist@@ rar have had serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will heat up the current occupation crisis and it will be ab@@ used to treat all doctors . &quot;
in just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors drop under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
the BM@@ A &apos;s efforts to resolve disputes met with the government for relu@@ ct@@ ance to engage and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was one of the promises that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had just done last month that his door would be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the condition and address the concerns of the assistant doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should he fail to do so , the assistant doctors made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work campaign measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13,@@ 000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included to provide doctors on the strike post .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better weekend re@@ mun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4.000 assistant doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS staff , called on the assistant doctors to stop the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; there is nothing to do with working combat measures , but are already bur@@ dened by over@@ bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare patients , car@@ ers and their families only worries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the last two months , we spoke to the committee of the assist@@ ants and responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stri@@ es regarding the concerns of guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wing .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who come back from a professional training period , training k@@ olo@@ g , mutual recognition of cur@@ riculum , advanced training and the gender Ministry regarding compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May were .
the £ 2 @-@ per tag@@ - drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day medication after being advised by the authorities to administ@@ er this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
the regulatory authority NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authority NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
approximately 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls , which form layers .
when the surface breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that clo@@ g the blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , manufactured by British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and mark@@ eted under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots unlikely .
the preliminary draft of NI@@ CE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with an asp@@ ir@@ in twice daily intake for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of NI@@ CE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person &apos;s quality of life .
experience shows that in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who have already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rec@@ tness makes electoral fraud in Muslim areas blo@@ oming
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year for corruption from office due to corruption
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored , as a crus@@ hing government report today dis@@ closed .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to have ignored proof of electoral abuse due to &quot; over@@ sensitivity to Eth@@ nie and Religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of vot@@ ers from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers out of voting cabins to protect in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated vot@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that vot@@ ers should have a badge to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment a vot@@ er only has to name his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger when they release their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions from un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves against electoral fraud , but also aims to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ let Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ate court decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved of corrupt and illegal practices of his office after a lit@@ any .
the court found Rah@@ man per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal manner , &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis of the religious duty of Muslims to elect him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which a person cho@@ oses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud all over the country .
he expressed himself particularly al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent election - with the older members of the Muslim community putting pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including running out ID to prove the identity
in his report , it says : &quot; as evidence has been applied to pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions have kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored such behaviour because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discre@@ pan@@ cies on ethnic and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition that political activists modify correspondence documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ aping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral and social inclusion policies being used .
consider options to ask vot@@ ers before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
perform systematic reviews of the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are eligible for election purposes .
a three year limit on applications to an automatic mail selection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban that political activists edit complete mail sel@@ ections and envel@@ opes from let@@ ter@@ heads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police give the authority to set up barriers to electoral stations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change in laws facilit@@ ating an indictment for in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation pursuant to the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
prohibition of taking photographs in election stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the electoral stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training to ensure that the employees rule out the rule that vot@@ ers go to the election cabin alone .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case no criminal complaint was put .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral law has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy to corrupt and illegal practices due to a lit@@ any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on a number of reasons - in compliance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; check @-@ ups &quot; of the election registration departments of the town halls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country is a proud inheritance as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments , but the wor@@ rying and conce@@ aled spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
mad after K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are out of line with the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Fer@@ rand @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , which proved to be an impressive double @-@ enthusi@@ ast of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only ath@@ l@@ ete competing for gold which has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if you may believe the social media faith .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympics that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the Hunter and the Wolf : team member of the U.S. crew in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared to Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
besides K@@ ate &apos;s Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the wheel track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi could be Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures showing the Wolf of Wall Street star un@@ c@@ anny lik@@ ened .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not see any great simil@@ arity except the face hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good looking guy , so I hate that as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her large expressive eyes is said to be a double @-@ pl@@ ore for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
a bit higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , which has similar severe eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal winner Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points out more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory put into space : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter User@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own wonderful , wide smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympics ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers died &quot; like a pig . &quot;

Canadian broad@@ c@@ aster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers went down as low and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was switched off when he left his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200 free @-@ style float .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought on board the C@@ BS comment@@ ator team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard say : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , Baby . &quot;
to be excited , went down like M@@ ief , died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming st@@ aff@@ el 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Can@@ adi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
spectators throughout Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were sho@@ cked by sound and language .
Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ away twe@@ et , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just say that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; like a pig died ? ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot didn &apos;t get that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming aid for women in the following manner : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , Baby . &quot;
the criticism of By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter was quick and hard , in which many people talked about him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users didn &apos;t stop when they heard how sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ ow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and make all of us look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC programme , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comment and said , &quot; We ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for 90 times in the people who responded to the emer@@ gen@@ cies via Twitter
the comment@@ ator Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ olog@@ ise in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users who compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ap@@ ologi@@ zed yesterday night to our spectators on the show and our fol@@ lies in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments referring to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the broadcast and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was interpreted as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swi@@ mmer in the C@@ BC Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been referring to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was no contemp@@ t and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shop@@ pers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who sham@@ elessly under@@ takes under@@ wear in the shop
the buyers did not know where to look , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a place to try out under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she mu@@ stered the way she looked in it , pulled her out and put her back into the shelf .
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman ta@@ sted the under@@ pants before putting her back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the shop at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she moved up again and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled off her own ti@@ ghts and trousers and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat discre@@ et place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled off the under@@ pants that you obviously did not like , as they put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , moved up again and went out .
&quot; she did not seem to b@@ other that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who would possibly buy the under@@ pants he had tried . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would have under@@ pants with home that had a different person and which were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the staff tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new couple of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and with@@ drew again and they were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , August 9 in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question were pulled out of the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
the outside world is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn around the sk@@ e@@ wer for your pre@@ dat@@ or .
when you approach you from behind , you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; move out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
then grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with his knees in the bar and twist while the attack@@ er hur@@ ries before pain , the weapon from his hands . strike him with the barrel into the face and move backwards while they direct the weapon to him .
in case of attack@@ ers approaching from the front , technique is similar - move your body from the firing line , grab the gun and twist it , so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon from his grip before moving backwards and the weapon hits him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly what Miz@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
but remember that if you &apos;re not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master , it &apos;s the saf@@ est way to hand over your money .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right che@@ ers his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a travel guide
a British traveler under@@ went a serious test of his immune system and saus@@ age lex by le@@ ver@@ aging some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting locations in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ orted his train to Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a r@@ ins@@ ing knob of a ten@@ sile toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before le@@ vering any object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he will let himself be .
but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the thought of le@@ aking the r@@ ins@@ ing knob of a pull @-@ out toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right talked with doctors and medical experts about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left behind what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public ban@@ ist@@ ers to railway stations to pur@@ ge pots of toilets , the task put his immune system definitely under a test
in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud . &quot;
in the film he was definitely justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample scre@@ ed showed a lumin@@ escence value of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric value of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their lumin@@ aires were over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst I have done in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I &apos;m not going to dock here , because it &apos;s disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the fo@@ stering of gut bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ o Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended with saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide the consumer with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direc@@ ting , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had told him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick it and others where it was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associate lac@@ tic acid bacteria particularly with the well@@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing accompanying lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destro@@ ys before del@@ og@@ ation social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social flat after a del@@ og@@ ation of £ 50,000 because it had terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
having been for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , sho@@ cked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had holes , logs were opened , garbage was stre@@ wn on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls .
the family has been moved and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people do not have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said the terror that the family had added , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all sl@@ um@@ bers , in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ ams , quar@@ rels and cur@@ ses .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease agreement , was an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which can be torn down , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the property in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden boards were torn
neighbours told us that they saw them fighting on the street and had to call the police on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall Housing signed a for@@ ci@@ ble transfer from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ og@@ ation was che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were not afraid of anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived next to them 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have arranged the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the over@@ grown side of the village house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant lo@@ oses to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family , as del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step into consideration of Corn@@ wall Housing .
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horri@@ bly included for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have gra@@ c@@ efully approached us and gave us the information we have provided .
I hope that this development will offer comfort to some neighbours and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ og@@ ation on the floor .
workers in the house administration will now have to evacu@@ ate garbage mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash at £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after having found himself guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug in commercial intent .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 at a car accident .
having been without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ y@@ mouth .
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will be del@@ og@@ ged rent@@ ers who do not comply with the rules of the house
Angela C@@ row of the Devon and Corn@@ wall police informed that the del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not comply with the rules of the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without self @-@ repro@@ ach as well as to those who have been har@@ med by such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal displac@@ ed after a bus@@ hing military jet over@@ flies the beach
sun wor@@ shi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a port@@ ug@@ isi@@ es@@ ches P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of air forces put an incredible crash
the Air Force admitted that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no safety risk
this was the moment in which sc@@ ary tourists start to panic after a bus@@ hing jet cr@@ ashes over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the holi@@ day@@ makers sprang up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without first seeing what came through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
N@@ uno Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and unbeliev@@ ably deep flew .
the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so low that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that due to the poor visibility of the area around the area , the jet flew somewhat lower than usual , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety was at no time at risk .
area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where also four people on the island Madeira came to death .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly as low as possible due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke - which limits his view .
the aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona fights for the first step towards the first win in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup out against the FC Sevilla , the back @-@ game rises three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Double@@ winner has to wai@@ ve the tournament with the inferior and ruling Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reig@@ ning European League champion , among others , to Ne@@ y@@ mar , who cont@@ ests the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
in addition , there is a shortage of Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
the German suffered a change of b@@ anding in the knee in the training , which clari@@ fied the demand for Bar@@ ca at least for the benefit of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen race in Barcelona for two years now as number one .
in this respect , Coach Luis En@@ rique gave up a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the rest of the applicants .
before the first mandatory match of the new season there is doubt about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool to 0 : 4 .
also at the 3 : 2 in the rehear@@ sal session against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really convince .
Sevilla , again , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after pro@@ long@@ ation in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
Barcelona is now eleven vic@@ tories of the record winner in this competition .
mA Long in its own league of table tennis gold
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis game for table tennis .
on Thursday in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and defending champion Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) .
thus the World Cup first scored the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ als tournament and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese managed to get into the final game as expected and made the title with each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top@@ most Olympia @-@ podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
mA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sets and in time @-@ outs , they had no coaches .
they with@@ drew from the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their guns in a fair competition on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches until now I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang was logical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the match gold and silver med@@ alists with the China flag posed .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
mA had really to fight with its 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first movement .
after that , he set the pace on the plate and dropped Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma there was not the expected ro@@ using match .
but there were nevertheless enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ an had bred a rib@@ cage to the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , who was then satisfied with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) , by the way , have been in a similar high table tennis player Olympic @-@ V@@ ated .
Donald Tr@@ ump wins ″ huge problems &apos; in election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now revealed weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which a multi @-@ lane and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ lion appeared such a thing as concerns how correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own rep@@ ubli@@ can camp from the race , there are now doubts about his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians whom he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt is false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he res@@ um@@ ed his well @-@ known media shi@@ ping again .
rep@@ ubli@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ag
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ ard from June , Tr@@ ump and his coun@@ cill@@ or were con@@ vic@@ ted by the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also endangered .
in an interview with the transmitter CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t do anything else than to tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , if it is not enough for him for reasons of political correc@@ tness , it is al@@ right , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party should have threatened Tr@@ ump to cancel funds for the support of his electoral campaign , he should not present any better survey results .
instead , the candidate of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans for Congress would be stronger than the poor .
Olympia : tri@@ ght fraud on dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at Rio de Jan@@ eiro in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee admitted to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told us that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to the Team Leader Ken@@ yan &apos;s dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has requested the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own research , announced an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; according to the results of the investigation and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; said the IA@@ AF declaration .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and turned out to be F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , who gave and signed the trial , &quot; declared Ken@@ yan Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the ac@@ creditation of the ath@@ l@@ ete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics deleg@@ ate Michael Rot@@ ich was stri@@ pped off from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he is said to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
for a long time , Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C following numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Games , it was previously pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic beginning .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Ken@@ yan from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control was compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a number of TV reports the ARD has repeatedly alle@@ g@@ ated that dop@@ ing remedies are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ting .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar study in Kenya as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been proven that this kind of sport has been covered in a widespread and systematic way .
Russian athletes were excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with it , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
Salzburg enters Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; the chim@@ ney Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a night@@ mare .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music in our blood !
in this stage Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members melanch@@ oly in her love with Tony , while the younger Lady plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mari@@ as personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an enor@@ mously generous human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with it .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; highly top@@ ical : &quot; in this piece it is about pre@@ ju@@ dice and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as at the time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London School Girl Who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , IT@@ V news reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the country @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - stopping people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from east London went to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ ana &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will stay as candidate for the Supreme Court in case of election victory at Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Pres@@ idential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ can in the Senate have blocked Gary &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will ap@@ point the successor of the late Jud@@ ge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
a spokesperson from Rei@@ d said later that he would not have talked with Clinton about nomin@@ ating Gar@@ land and he was spec@@ ulating .
he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Jud@@ ge of the U.S. App@@ eals Court for the District of Columbia .
RAID said rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nomin@@ ee , be lack@@ eys and hero@@ in heroes from the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
tre@@ ats wants cervi@@ cal calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine works together with the photographer David Belle@@ ville to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked men , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es calendar in 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes us , as Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , he thinks it does the Calendar as well .
&quot; we need to return to the depic@@ tion of timeless and classical nu@@ dity in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to release the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community reck@@ ons with a mass flight
&quot; anyone who does not fit and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Pres@@ idency of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
in the short term , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of investig@@ ators who flee from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term it could even become &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; according to the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
because of the harsh criticism of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand guar@@ dians from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the Chairman of the Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday .
because the government had already moved Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds with sanctions few months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing within Turkey .
after the failed coup , there are still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
many will want to start an@@ ew in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that is taking refugees itself has produced refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the association accused the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in Ala@@ wit@@ e cities .
that is why Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the outlet pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or driven out in the last hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the association called for the government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany too , a witch @-@ hunt takes place against Erdo@@ gan critics .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; anyone who does not fit and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises , sits on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and secular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , President of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper by calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks have already placed the largest group of asylum entitled asylum rights recognized in Germany before the coup .
at the reporting date June 30 , this was 11.@@ 386 people , and thus nearly 29 per cent of all known as as@@ yl@@ ated investors ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , there is no need for war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum entitled according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia should not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 the country code will not be held right at the end of summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because stupid as far it is not : summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - that bit@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the locals , who are to be persu@@ aded by the election fighters , are on vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers travelling in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so you can &apos;t choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : in the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count on the end of the vote , only lab@@ ori@@ ously apply .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign just close to the people over themselves .
the hot phase when you can say that at all has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly lag@@ ging behind the CD@@ U .
it is exciting how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D inter@@ sec@@ ts and what remains at the end of coalition dust .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign of election , one sees from his large posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ting a bit with the people , just as it did his legendary password @-@ car@@ er predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff .
otherwise past@@ ors got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel is bl@@ aming the bl@@ os@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the interior minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced what it is like to make electoral campaigns at the right time at the wrong time .
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to open up mass demonstrations ; Angela Merkel is lying in the north @-@ east .
but the target group was not right , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Meckl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; lam@@ ented Vincent Kok@@ ert , secretary general of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
apart from that , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely elimin@@ ates the usual electoral competition on market places and in front of shopping centers with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ ert , plays only a minor role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that in the country you crum@@ ble the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are going on like the Left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly any in the expan@@ ses of the country .
but the advice of the CD@@ U vot@@ er Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD had clearly won 35.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the land day .
from holiday poverty , they make a modern virtue and expose their election campaign largely to the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign &quot; calls it the national president Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green election fighters go for search for native vot@@ ers among holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ ens with a hou@@ s@@ ebo@@ at through the lakes of Mecklenburg and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ref@@ urb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is refurb@@ ished .
for those who are in charge of the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end at 8 p.m. , there are all praise .
&quot; they made everything pretty sha@@ ky , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet petrol station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay .
the construction site could be moved to the south on a scheduled basis at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be finished .
this is also said to be the ac@@ compli@@ ce of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of in@@ sist@@ ence entran@@ ces .
since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the inter@@ ruption of the Asp@@ erg@@ asse in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg became again , the traffic situation within the town was relaxed .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the so@@ fter traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable dis@@ comfort , &quot; says the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the traffic management of the refurb@@ ishment .
the residents of Bach@@ el@@ strasse , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping trails were looking for and more tru@@ sting their nav@@ i than the signs .
what led to the fact that some trucks fit into residential areas .
since the speed limits were not met , the municipality reinforced the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable exceed@@ ances , &quot; says King , who expressed himself about the situation even on the ground .
two to three per minute have been bl@@ ot@@ ted .
the fastest was on the road with 77 hours kilometers in the tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men on the B 27 , it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg , the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to revenue dis@@ bur@@ sts lets everyone look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; , i.e. for other companies , have hardly any consequences for the refurb@@ ishment .
even at the deal@@ ership Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z talks about a &quot; most light drop , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that , of course , &quot; running documents are missing . &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the locals along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he estimates sales losses to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road @-@ landing took its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dism@@ iss the half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation with the hint that the restaurant otherwise would benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now it must also bear the dis@@ advantages that arise from the rehabilitation .
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other coun@@ ties where something more generous has been handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history .
that other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you cannot approach , it is also very different .
he has no doubts that his stem @-@ cl@@ ause comes back at the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on his client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s brutal .
all the time , under the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are bol@@ ted to laws .
after the recent attacks , Minister of the Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the owner .
all his proposals are &quot; politically acceptable &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package .
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anybody .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was on results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has left a little time before he presents his conclusions for the safety in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , filed : that a new security authority is to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU guidelines on passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second attempt for proposals that have not been done with the SPD so far : he wants to impose sympathy for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck ji@@ hadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still thinks this is reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything at all , which doesn &apos;t have any chances for the coalition partner anyway .
the Mai@@ zi@@ ère also presents a few new ideas .
they are part of it : he plans fast @-@ screening procedures for dep@@ ort@@ ations and more opportunities for det@@ aining people from dep@@ ortation .
refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones in advance and dis@@ close social media accounts for a safety check .
in Dul@@ ce for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to face some worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to mask their identity .
some of it is politically and legally un@@ cle .
some things are still un@@ balanced and open questions .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient - for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with safety and terror ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not possible to say that the amb@@ ass@@ adors of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , in the face of the high refugee figures , many people were worried about security .
and things that people deeply concerned were not allowed to cl@@ ap in election campaign times .
the inner security has moved enor@@ mously .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are election fights .
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly placing themselves in position on the subject of internal security .
in the past few days , the two parties grew up .
only a spiritual contro@@ vers@@ y about the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some of the Interior Minister , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban and a return from the dual citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling here for con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from turning away from a double pass .
we have ended the discussion in Germany .
making it new is not useful .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns .
whether his own parcel is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , has yet to show itself .
there is a lot in it , which could cause quar@@ rel .
but the SPD is also trying to pro@@ claim internal security on the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to enhancing safety further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen got off lightly .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery numbers rise worldwide .
but it does not work in all markets .
in the recall action , there is confusion about a term .
Volkswagen starts sales in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in spite of its many brands and a number of well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand , VW , was weak@@ ening primarily in Western Europe and again imp@@ acted the sale of the company as a company listed in the D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer cars than in the previous year with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars .
sales in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China , were 14 percent lower than in the previous year .
deliveries in the home market of Germany declined by almost a sixth .
sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann reduced the weaker figures from July primarily on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave a relu@@ ct@@ ance to buy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also bur@@ dened the EU &apos;s exit from the EU , explained a spokesperson .
in the USA , where the exhaust gases first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected brand of Lower Saxony got off lightly by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an extra@@ dition of 0.9 percent represents 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales president Fred Kap@@ pler continued sales plans from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen has been manipul@@ ating abor@@ tion tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars to convert into workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after changing the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
after retro@@ fitting , the toll@@ booth will provide customers with a &quot; guarantee &quot; certification , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as was the case on Friday in corporate circles .
the reason is legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now considers its German customers a guarantee of re@@ construc@@ ting diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Monday , this would have confirmed VW representative at the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully fulfilled the requirements of my investig@@ ative commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; declared Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has covered the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance cannot be wor@@ sen@@ ed after retro@@ fitting and all typical vehicle values have remained unchanged .
Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was in business circles .
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , half a year after the upgrade , customers can come into a workshop with engine damage - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in the interests of customers , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas sc@@ andal , there is to be an uncertainty about possible warranty rules as it was called .
this is why VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see in future demands pen@@ alties from rich savings - as a second institute in Germany .
Bank Director Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; it &apos;s just 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gre@@ ed or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see in it a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal pass@@ ers @-@ by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should not be afraid of paying pen@@ alties for their savings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ al rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fee is due to the Raiff@@ eisen Bank G@@ mund as of September of private and corporate customers for deposits exceeding € 100,000 in sight deposit accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost € 400 a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he be@@ ware of 40 million euros for quite some time , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; said the Head of Bank .
&quot; I cannot put up for every million Euros . &quot;
according to the poll@@ u@@ ter principle , the cost will now continue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be far too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already experienced four incidents , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the bank@@ note . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have an understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern agreed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy strategy causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you alone bear , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thur@@ ing@@ ian Volks@@ - und Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros .
Michael Kem@@ mer , head of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay widespread charges for deposits , and competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client@@ ele , which is a little more generous of wealth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is free for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
established in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
the region is home to well @-@ known actors , sport@@ s@@ men and entrepreneurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no other banks are currently known to the cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which calculate a compensation fund for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the German Federal Association of the German Volks@@ banken and Raiff@@ eisen@@ banken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ ativity is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and the immigration of investors is threatened .
the customers in Germany will not let it please in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who purchases vinyl records ?
lonely men average age love plates .
before moving to the comment section to see him under the p@@ seud@@ onym &quot; Non@@ Alle@@ ein@@ sper@@ ger &quot; age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of sound boards is not a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but rather to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ de by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are You@@ go@@ v &apos;s results correct ?
if this blog is a news report on TV , the camera would follow me as I run in the midst of a busy street in S@@ oho , wearing a modest grey suit and gra@@ ze wil@@ dly before I stand , hold my hands and say something better : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ ho@@ s is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic board specialist shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part where I stand in direct proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , from S@@ ister Ray ( data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably about the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by email , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he couldn &apos;t afford when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60 &apos;s , early 70 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; appeared when I was 11 or 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agre@@ es that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the You@@ go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pub , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are promp@@ ted to buy their old records again .
from the conversations I have conducted , people usually have been dischar@@ ged from their collection by 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like phon@@ ica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers received an imp@@ etus from the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers , from objects that ev@@ oke happy memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s like a collector so and I think it &apos;s so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fle@@ es from a deck stack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t own a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried while brow@@ sing through a stack of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone just came here recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead acoustic board so I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ grade , less musi@@ c@@ wise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly enter .
F@@ opp , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the sound board , has an entertaining audience when I enter .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ ed pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ um@@ ming from loud@@ speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity in the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ach when standing next to someone 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the shop for a few minutes and exam@@ ines the variety of plates for sale .
it &apos;s more of a window @-@ shop than a big shopping .
it does not earn much , so collecting records is not a real option , it says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives away with a loving sigh@@ s .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of turn@@ key enthusiasts : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
as I give the impression to pattern the je@@ ans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing for a moment around Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of So@@ ho@@ s for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records .
even though my research showed that the results of You@@ go@@ v vote , they , at least in Platten@@ häu@@ tigen in S@@ oho , do not take into account the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , plate stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not by st@@ rolling through plat@@ st@@ ings of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through records , while they avoid the star@@ ing gaze of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old wrong moder@@ ator who runs over the shoulders of no middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects the ban on the issu@@ ing of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of pro@@ visional businesses and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week the authorities argued in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to submit 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ visional restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and which would have a risk of fire and quality .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the government @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the pro@@ visional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who run the 72 pro@@ visional business , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely understandable . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than feed only people living in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is co @-@ operated and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &quot; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a disaster from which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

despite Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant

&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and fight further , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Jan@@ eiro on Facebook .
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the Su@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut .

he must analyze in silence the reasons for the de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin wanted to fight for the title at the October World Championship in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed over the past few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

group climb@@ s at start @-@ up for live video games
watching other people playing video games is a huge escape - Microsoft will also benefit from it .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which speci@@ alizes in this hobby .
Microsoft on Thursday didn &apos;t share how much money flo@@ wed for the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am started his offer only in January at the start and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also intervene .
for example , they can give players failures and counter@@ pose enemies , as well as provide equipment items .
the Ac@@ ti@@ vision Bli@@ zz@@ ard game team starts a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of electric sports .
on the way to global media event Facebook is supposed to help .

the employee of the start @-@ up , which has its headquarters in Seattle in the US state of Washington , moved to Microsoft &apos;s headquarters in Red@@ mond , California , as Be@@ am @-@ Co @-@ Fo@@ under and CEO Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i shared .
therefore , the tak@@ eover will not change anything for the customer .
Be@@ am is integrated in the video games department around the Xbox console according to Microsoft .
the live streaming market for video games is growing fast .
known platforms are T@@ witch and YouTube Gaming .
T@@ witch was purchased by online retail@@ er Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars .

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed sensor : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , which are intended to transfer Temp@@ os@@ ks exceptionally effectively .
the fut@@ uris@@ tic En@@ forcement Trailer for Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used in areas of accident , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to build bridges with temporary speed , there are often no infrastructure required to ensure that there is a fixed speed limit .
a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted by a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limits as well as drive @-@ through messages after time , travel stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state , the trailer can be fitted with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer .
so that it is not simply cl@@ utter@@ ed , it is lowered in the measurement mode so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also fire @-@ proof outer shell disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itz from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer for information from Vit@@ ronic has been tested in various states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also fl@@ ashes with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , following an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain gets silver in 7 @-@ Series Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gets gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ year rug@@ by in the final on Thursday evening came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji divided a master class in handling , side st@@ epp@@ ing , back , line and raw power to win Gold - its first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was swe@@ pt through the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the significant defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the fin@@ als .
but irrespective of this , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least one bre@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head trainer Ben Ryan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago , she lost every match at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
this fla@@ p will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began mar@@ vel@@ ous and ra@@ cked the G@@ Bs &apos; attacks from fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . on , as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au passed down in the corner .
with just four minutes of playing Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner , which he changed .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
a prot@@ ra@@ cted T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third gate , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a l@@ ete a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji would have been born to play 7 while GB is still to be learned .
this is how it is .
GB led fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favor of the South Korean , whose fans sang , sw@@ ung flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach to Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle rang out , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and GB ti@@ pped crus@@ hing in the grass .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a scar@@ ce half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match of the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the boats in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , Anthony of the British 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer for a rowing victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ inal gold than in these games and that will mean what is called .
from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was all present when they o@@ wed to the second Olympic champion in the second without a tax wife , the first women in the history of British Sports who laid such a benchmark .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all their 39,@@ 000 failed deployment , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lets , gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the kind of triumph .
behind each gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and there was no other assistant than the coach who did not know before 30 months whether he would survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did .
if you don &apos;t do it , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the break down to a minimum , in case that was the correct term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it starts .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but it makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a rainy morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much this means to me how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning never lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very tra@@ pped at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; remain in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we didn &apos;t look out to make any ra@@ bies .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for clarity provided for 31 years
the managing director of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
the association is considered &quot; Bavarian &quot; exemplary . &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers .
so ago it was in the original tone in an article of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
a little later , the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia Government honoured the purpose association .
the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; Bavarian &quot; is considered exemplary . &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the company of Zw@@ eck@@ verband , stands for 28 years as Managing Director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the Dr@@ inking Water Authority of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , annually supports about 15@@ 0,000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities of Kirch@@ straße , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach are members of the municipalities .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current Chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert was appointed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ ban@@ en in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work through office and organizational activities , bud@@ get@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event , she called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , real estate purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the high can@@ ister ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pi@@ pelines .
there was no stal@@ em@@ ate and I always added innovations because water is the main food and drinking water is the most important food .
in their lau@@ dation , Gö@@ ll@@ ers praised the faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he used a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he settled the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , he was a real practi@@ tioner to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe as a nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
for that he received a lot of praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller praised water wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful cra@@ p .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
the highlights from his point of view were the fountain building and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ ban@@ en .
however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were the bur@@ gl@@ ary on the high can@@ ister at church lou@@ der on a third of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
one can only maintain the supply of Neu@@ brunn , because one filled the high can@@ ister from P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot on Friday at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n district ) and injured it mort@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called on us and stated to have shot his companion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , and after him I will be publicly punished .
by now nation@@ wide , because Sven S. might be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a gloss .
meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
meanwhile , the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
whoever sees Sven S. should call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship of relationships . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
in the first place , the police in Lü@@ beck intended not to provide any information about the conduct or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a person had been killed .
&quot; it is a killing deli@@ ri@@ um . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special case command ( SE@@ K ) was the crime scene .
STAHL - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains un@@ affected by additional costs in millions of euros .
financial bur@@ dens that the industry threatened from the green electricity promotion are from the table .
in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Um@@ bearing in the existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ electricity production in the German steel industry , Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally reach that after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers that use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry was threatening additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Com@@ miss@@ ar Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent applies .
but even this is not raised in the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ electricity production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined .
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also with the reform of the emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said IG Metall @-@ chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation was further exac@@ erb@@ ated when the world &apos;s largest producer of China cast massive steel to the world market in light of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers repro@@ ach Chinese steel companies price d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel impact , on the other hand , the economic outlook in China is bri@@ ghtened .
it is un@@ clear how sustainable the price collection is .
German industry priest Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
in the end , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual plants .
around 86@@ 0,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , just as the German economic association announced on Friday .
after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the produced quantity returned to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has risen by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output .
community , spirit , health : singing good sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : she was a young girl in the school choir , in Leh@@ ra@@ mt he studied music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good with her health and spirit .
for singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of Deutsche Seni@@ or@@ en@@ liga .
most of the sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and cultivate social contacts .
often social and family structures dissolve in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has also made this experience in her choir : &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly require their lungs are not so quickly out of the box in everyday life .
even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an ideal hobby .
in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft ( Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft ) for senior citizens .
in the older generations , singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure , it explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive emotions of their adol@@ escence .
through lyrics and especially melodies themselves , people with dementia are sin@@ king back to long @-@ lying events .
in singing , the head is also demanding a special performance , L@@ enz says .
focusing on one &apos;s voice and rhythm at the same time and adap@@ ting to the other singers - that &apos;s a big cognitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone are practicing so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I do something for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
there are plenty of good reasons to start singing .
those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz recommends .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who h@@ ears when a sound goes wrong ?
on the search for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings among the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leaders .
many sen@@ iors can also be found on the Internet .
if you do not have access to the internet , your family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the Internet research .
whoever wants to sing should definitely join a choir , he advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers on the cri@@ es of the young
in Hannover , bi@@ ologists examined the effect of k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; calls for adult animals .
to their surprise , the males also did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of k@@ itt@@ ens on the face of the small ones .
they respond ten percent faster to the sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , which in great need , as scientists from the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) have found out .
han@@ go@@ vers also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ating of less and heavily excited k@@ itt@@ ens for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Con@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous examination , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ cri@@ es differ with the ur@@ gency of their need for help .
a total of nine adult males and eight que@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a call of little ones , who were taken out of the wor@@ m@@ box for three minutes and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand they were confronted with scre@@ aming of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens that were up@@ lifted .
the researchers maintain their results despite the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , responded differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said .
they turned faster to the speaker when this pack of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played off .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds in humans .
some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to inf@@ ants , no matter if they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former foot@@ b@@ aller Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match is held in Turkey .
before the Du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already in the case of the arrest of the exceptional state after the July revolution trial , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens should not be affected .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt .
at the same time , football is not stopped .
the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office issued an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
accordingly , the South @-@ West living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ver is said to be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is held responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , actually , it does not have any effects on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan an exit on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into tra@@ ilers and opponent Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the labor @-@ club Bes@@ ik@@ tas traditionally do not count among the friends of the president .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , the anger of the Turks is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at cup winner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne @-@ based Cologne proof@@ ed his athle@@ tic value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top sc@@ orer of his club .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ ATI@@ K &quot; rejo@@ iced : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record champion found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion .
after finishing in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also drift early in the Europa League .
in the South Li@@ g it was just six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski .
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th position with 26 season @-@ hits as the Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ shake @-@ King .
this is also the reason for the fans to continue hoping for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
on the occasion of the coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at of AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez had to be announced after the attempted coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after its Euro @-@ holidays .
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he has to say it , &quot; c@@ ited the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club boss F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
however , the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to for@@ go about one third of his annual mil@@ age estimated to € 7.5 million , Or@@ man said : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have even medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa must not start in Rio .
other super@@ charged athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh at it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ line at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who compl@@ ained about her start right shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was plu@@ cked out mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 metres chest ) .
it offered a sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile setting : with a put smile she was still standing in the hall and was prov@@ oked with her performance .
when it was fixed that she would not get gold , the audience burst into a storm .
but there are numerous other sport@@ s@@ men going to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 year old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been running even faster than before . he is the number one in the world for more than 100 m and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to wait for a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after you have been detected by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don pain .
after surgery she had severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion was tested positive for the banned stimul@@ ant Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic suffered the occasional intake and was locked for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great Golden fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion of 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and 21 months closed .
a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , stepped Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ throw , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ l@@ ete has been det@@ ained so many medals afterwards .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympics silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title 2006 because of testosterone deficiency .
the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was also returned due to a verdi@@ ct of the international sports court in CAS .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record holder and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championships , references to the intake of a forbidden dietary supplement were found , the barrier of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ der and was already running on 13 July .
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
I suffered from cutting bru@@ ises and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left it .
it was planned for the beginning of September .
whether other explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon , also Austrian citizens , are still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , such as waste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life two bombs .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and another man was killed according to the authorities .
a bomb explosion was also reported in the morning by Ph@@ uk@@ et .
a taxi driver was injured during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the explosive rate had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south@@ western coast and in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ eastern coast were demanding several injuries .
from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Freiburg on Friday morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to comment on possible motifs - but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that are typical for the bom@@ bing rate of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sabot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid .
in recent days the authorities would have received secret references to forth@@ coming attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed of the exact date and the places .
it is still un@@ clear which group is behind the attacks .
the police told their officials across the country to rein@@ force security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are again and again smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they are not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in lies a palace that was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the bom@@ bing explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry is recommen@@ ding to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary trips to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution dra@@ fted by the jun@@ ta .
this gives the military a great influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create may@@ hem , while the country moves towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , who had seized power after a period of bloody un@@ rest in 2014 , ad@@ heres to the kingdom of stability and order .
however , the military hasn &apos;t managed to get a grip on the revol@@ ving uprising of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
just a year ago , in Bangkok , at an attack on a popular Hin@@ du event , 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several regional offices , the Federal Constitutional Court has also set the group under observation .
&quot; in the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; we see evidence for as@@ pi@@ rations to the free democratic fundamental order , &quot; said Constitutional Protection chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
in this way , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we observe the movement now too .
the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
constitutional Protection in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely aligned with the decision makers at the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; groups like the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court .
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertising for your own thing .
propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there were reports from several federal states on the contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not know . &quot; &quot;
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant at a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - is changing its target direction by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist and so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor therefore is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with regard to the significant increase in legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and asylum seek@@ ers , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right @-@ wing terrorism in this context .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have found in recent years that there can be right @-@ wing structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
it may well be that further right @-@ wing groups or small groups are planning to plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nation@@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were developed on the regional level or in social networks .
he expressed concern that many enc@@ ro@@ achments went to the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
that is the cause of concern .
many of the susp@@ ects on asylum accommodations had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or who have chosen CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , who , however , have radic@@ alised themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mo@@ ods . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympic med@@ alli@@ sts or world records set the head@@ lines at the Olympics .
this shows the courage@@ ous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were so slow that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was not just a sporting character that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates at the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in the under@@ represented countries more famous .
since most athletes are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the round .
some media identified him as the &quot; ro@@ uble of the wh@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referring to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter fre@@ estyle , played no part .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
unforgettable was the appearance of the float of Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in an incident of over 100 meters of Freestyle .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was che@@ ered f@@ rene@@ tically at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim just eight months before the Olympic Games and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop in the New Place has been stolen .
according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in left her business on Monday at 17.@@ 30 and forgot to close a window on the ground floor .
when she came back the next morning around 8 : 15 o &apos;clock , about 250 euros had disappeared from the cas@@ hier .
traces of the perpet@@ r@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
tr@@ ump does not see the threatening electoral defeat so narrow
Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is talking about an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing with the election of the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video .
he then just goes on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses U.S. presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC .
if it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correc@@ tness , that is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
thus he described the US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist mili@@ tia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party there was more and more resistance .
post goes into trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is apparently large .
the mail is planning to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter .
shortly thereafter , the Group wants to launch trade with the transp@@ orter .
the Post will also offer its electric v@@ ans from the next year on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter third parties in the sale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they will be delivered to their own Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with the letters and par@@ c@@ els sold to other companies .
post @-@ Managing Director Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are always inquiries , such as craftsmen .
according to the news magazine Der Spiegel , the Bon@@ ner Group will shortly enter into mass production of the vehicles .
in the post @-@ production plant , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars a year and a shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the company wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and deliver a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we are changing the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter is active on German roads since 2014 .
G@@ FR@@ P lead to dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the Consumer Centre Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the re @-@ appearances occurred suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the Market Research Company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be even more uncertain , the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the resig@@ nation of the corporate management , the worldwide number five of the industry faces a new start .
G@@ FR@@ P boss wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
the management board member , Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , was appointed by the Management Board on 1 September , divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a reason for the re@@ tr@@ ations , the company called &quot; different views &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation .
a company spokes@@ man did not want to call details on Friday .
anyone who will lead the market research company in the future is still un@@ clear .
in An@@ chor circles it was said on Friday , among the shareholders , the dis@@ appointment about the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago had been great .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K peak since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , cannot be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the latest bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will some@@ time be rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this was the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company did not have to stop its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the comparable year @-@ earlier quarter .
in relation to the first half of the year , sales shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent at EUR 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million .
in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter mainly imp@@ acted the un@@ paid value of the company .
the Group &apos;s impair@@ ments of EUR 139 million , which were needed in the Consumer Experience business area , tot@@ aled EUR 14@@ 8.2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K had achieved a consolidated profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into cro@@ pping horns in tren@@ ches : eight injuries
in the event of an accident of a total of 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hearing ( district Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , condemned the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specifications , had to ev@@ ade a truck that partly ro@@ de on the other side of the road .
the bus stopped right off the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman for the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people were unable to leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ injured trav@@ eller was brought back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hearing in the district of Pe@@ w@@ sum by a bus bus .
there , they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators requested the truck driver and possible witnesses to sign up with the police .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic meter waste water amount to 2.@@ 10 Euro for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ th@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf the waste water fee will be increased by the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed .
after a per@@ tin@@ ent calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf is then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , it was noted in the approval of the budget by the administrative office Kul@@ mb@@ ach that under@@ cover for these sewage installations .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost @-@ efficient manner .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens as well as industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ th@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let .
the rate increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as administrative manager Herbert Schmidt showed up the panel , a new calculation of the fees for the waste water facilities of the market town was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ scores will be compens@@ ated from the previous calendar period .
Schmidt founded the engraving rate for fees with the fact that in all three wast@@ ewater facilities there were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water fall , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters a year .
as a result of the low distribution basis , for example expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining .
as a result of their age rehabilitation and repair expenditure , the calculations were not least due to a substantial scale in all three systems .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the plants for the world meal , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp are almost 20 years old .
Schmidt showed that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage in the wast@@ ewater system Az@@ endorf .
in the pump@@ ing mill Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be recovered from scratch and after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be cleared out , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water regulations in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued support and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period , came into consideration . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level of the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the case of a low waste water fall in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance &quot; were fully sm@@ ashed . &quot;
in addition to this , Schmidt , the market town of great entertainment costs for the sewage plant in the past 20 years , was spar@@ ed .
the situation for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned facilities will remain prec@@ ari@@ ous in view of stone houses in the long run , especially as the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wast@@ ewater association is not able to expand these facilities because it is a deficit unit .
Bulgaria marks the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first on zero since October last year , reported as a positive 0.2 % .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a rise in prices of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; free time and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in pre @-@ month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is non@@ sensi@@ cal to races .
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure coming out of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ blo@@ o@@ ded , self @-@ rotating tools generating more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day .
all mal@@ functions reach the public .
snap@@ shots have drawn criticism in the past , where they were accused of promoting either black face or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week introduced a filter to some users , who gave them mor@@ ti@@ ers , false teeth and uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ tail . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated contro@@ vers@@ y referred to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widely spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et was widely spread over the photos , said that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and emp@@ tied . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow face has been pulled to the extreme extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling ground .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more diverse in breed than their older antagon@@ ists - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things stay un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account called others to do the same .
in an ess@@ ay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that she believes that rac@@ ite contro@@ vers@@ y mirrors a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and finished their ess@@ ay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chin@@ es@@ ich @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say what to do against it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently recru@@ ited a personnel manager focusing on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership dist@@ orting IS@@ IS secret service information , establishes Committee of the Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command mean intelligence @-@ related information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual states would have allowed the site to report in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Committee , Intelligence Committee and the Army Com@@ mit@@ ee , reports from great dis@@ content among Central Command Secret Service Provi@@ ders who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state .
the Central Command , briefly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence official information , typically gen@@ dered by high @-@ level Cent@@ com Com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than the actual states would have allowed and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
the management errors in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct indications that government sp@@ ik@@ es under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how anal@@ ysts exposed the pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ s@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ sul , the second @-@ largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement .
from mid @-@ 2014 to mid @-@ 2015 , Central Command has changed intelligence reports to reduce the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after it was played to allow anal@@ ysts to worry about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be comple@@ mented by more detailed findings as the investigations continue .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are under way by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com has created a moder@@ ately restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; stated the highest @-@ level Democ@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement known .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated no evidence of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ com anal@@ ysts regarding a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor who was taken up for complaints by Cent@@ com anal@@ ysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still underway .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the issue of a successful aerial campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , last year accus@@ ations have raised the question that President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush looked at only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker &apos;s team stated that , contrary to government declar@@ ations , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these pro@@ visional refin@@ eries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s then commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Leg@@ is@@ l@@ ative for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel in Central Command .
the US is winning a fourth match in the women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey , show@@ down with Great Britain
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember ever having done that .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not one of the people who keep their gates in memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know , however , that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ches on the first place , who after their 2 @-@ 0 victory remain un@@ defeated .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first @-@ placed one will take a little longer from the strong Dutch , who lead the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vort@@ ex through their success story , four years after they ended up in the last London games on the last of 12 seats .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time with three years she had a Ho@@ ckey club in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , as she did not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
during the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work set in London that we have now .
we have completely ro@@ cked the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a return stroke from the local area .
India had gone into the game without any win in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Jan@@ eiro feel permanent and in@@ escap@@ able , a rapid relay between competition and as@@ piration .
it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning stick , which is handed down from the w@@ rist@@ guard to the swi@@ mmer to the gymn@@ asi@@ um .
you can &apos;t turn on the television , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s chat in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ verk@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock with dimples , could have been among those familiar names that are sent to Prime Time , created by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertis@@ ements , if he were a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast or even f@@ rank .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the center , some in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ols , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may rule for a long time .
but if I would like to make arguments for my particular favourite , let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the trampoline .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ sely perceived the last 16 years that many of those who had asked me did not know that it is a Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the US sent athletes to compete , there has never been a medal in the trampoline jumping competition and until 2012 had an ath@@ l@@ ete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider character , partly because it sounds more fitting for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a clo@@ wn school than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a given enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ or@@ istic potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ ical trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending boun@@ ce - but also the gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that it essentially combines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means &quot; jumping board &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up @-@ and @-@ coming vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling moti@@ ons ( turning , hat@@ ching and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
according to the official Olympi@@ apro@@ gram you will be judged according to design , difficulty and flight time .
twenty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must go further in their quest to gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes back and back , up and down on the playground .
they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall , but also another highlight in television broadcast : the world or the Olympic host .
the pur@@ pos@@ eful as@@ piration is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed while watching these games .
of this , the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less as an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then down@@ ward , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be .
the women &apos;s qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time , the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will ex@@ ude the final round as part of a afternoon blo@@ c on both days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the ang@@ ular@@ ity and the objective ti@@ ghtening of male athletes - as the male U.S. gymn@@ asts have recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one generation protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the USA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that tens of thousands of prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia just about to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government sho@@ ok the country and spread to more and more territories .
last week , thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the response of the government was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses alleged that polic@@ emen were shooting and killing dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circul@@ ating videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , how security officers beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN agency for human rights now demands a detailed investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads tend to be quiet , safe and clean .
even if e@@ thiop@@ ia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the suppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the v@@ ast@@ ings of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have other options except prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lectur@@ er in Central Ethiopia .
the whole youth protests .
a generation protests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
anal@@ ysts are worried that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been forced more or less in recent years , exploit the turbul@@ ence and can arm themselves again .
several factors explain why , after years of bitter@@ ness , feelings of bitter@@ ness under the surface are now explo@@ ding .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies who hide where they are .
several young e@@ thiop@@ ians stated that they were so prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ h@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons of e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian high countries , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are under a screen to coordinate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ h@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , the intelligence services , commerce and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years .
he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
anal@@ ysts say he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special mand@@ ates to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime l@@ acks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ clear reasons in order to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
anal@@ ysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 after thousands were prot@@ esting against elections , which , according to information by anal@@ ysts , were apparently fu@@ cked by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the ra@@ ids that followed , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the past few months and this time of tur@@ mo@@ il went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , and their measur@@ able progress in comb@@ ating poverty .
but evi@@ dently this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ norm@@ ality of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes on a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ inous town , managed by Tig@@ ray , and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more usual in the social media .
anal@@ ysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the US government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ Tours to neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his asser@@ tion Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday which res@@ um@@ ed his campaign by att@@ acking that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were not meant seriously by the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State .
this clari@@ fication gave rise to new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and coher@@ ently with the American public .
it also brings together his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position of declar@@ ing statements that he could not have meant .
having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump res@@ igned in relation to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not want to point out that the president and Mrs. Clinton have created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et Mr Tr@@ ump stated that he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump stated in a number of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know about it .
the last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has tried to direct his campaign &apos;s focus on the economic situation due to decl@@ ining demand .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton were talking to Mich@@ ig@@ an &apos;s economic situation this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he raised strong criticism when he said the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s emails , but later he said &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to rowing back as needed .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in a different way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more corro@@ sive tone as his survey values have gone further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leading lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently bl@@ ames his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humor .
but while he is increasingly focusing on attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ unk &apos;s j@@ okes have brought his loyal co @-@ workers to the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent leaders of Tr@@ ump , gave his candidate a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was asked about the correc@@ tness of Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown small organization , he called it but@@ chers , completely false , and so it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstream rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , Clinton &apos;s Secretary of State served as the Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to expand by taking control of the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump res@@ um@@ ed his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on each of his words and being bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s excuse as a further proof that he was un@@ fit for the presidential office .
once driven over the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back
ver@@ b Cafe was a not@@ arized café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , in which one could pay only cash which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were displac@@ ed .
the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie shop , which sold ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people committed it as the last loss in a thri@@ ving city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ B@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and ver@@ b is now a soap market . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it is also a re @-@ invention .
a revi@@ ved club Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north from its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a client offered to provide money for a new outside table , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps of the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ nish as cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural tears .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displac@@ ed by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliv@@ eira was such a client .
Oliv@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg before and regularly visited the ver@@ b .
even after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
after the ver@@ b closed , she gave up the coffee t@@ ines for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture in the club I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addi@@ tive .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went to work there , and inevitably always ordered the same thing .
&quot; I came to a quarter to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no anger about the fact that the hop business took the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new client translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he preferred to leave her soon , so that his new neighbors would feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee in the bottle .
there is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and the bur@@ ial felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plenti@@ ful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the Oval Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for sophisticated delic@@ acies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Tur@@ tle Sou@@ p .
his menu on this day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um cake .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband , Andrew Co@@ e , added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
the last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was the Chinese kitchen in the United States , while Zi@@ egel@@ man tells about life in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a rep@@ orter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , straightforward I@@ mb@@ iss at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the crash crash in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the rep@@ orter ordered min@@ ced beef , this was the pair for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver lo@@ af and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You Can E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male rock bite and it was served freshly baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; draws the roads with which the country went about to no longer be the land of Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food was a central , ten@@ se topic for the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : secret dishes such as bre@@ ads and br@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole was a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ dues , &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man noted , as chefs could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which was the central point of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
strange mix@@ tures were tried out , because a cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even wholes@@ ome cuisine .
while resear@@ ching the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from that era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it wasn &apos;t a popular addi@@ tive on lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions don &apos;t fit together .
it was typical for many of the domestic business recipes .
as never before or since , bud@@ get@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keeping politicians &quot; and the challenge to transform p@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical delic@@ acies .
in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ mich @-@ pie @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the millions @-@ million man from the world to whom he became .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cooking like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was a wonderful reality .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to take an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the hi@@ ring of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt suggested that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was disc@@ arded once the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to foods .
the couple gave in writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law better understood - for example how she could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wast@@ ing food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag @-@ incident .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , which President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt ate for lunch .
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a usual trick to miss a nice name for modest recipes .
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone turned a bit relu@@ ct@@ antly into the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly , it was not bad .
Co@@ E stri@@ pped three times a night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do bud@@ get@@ er he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died in a bom@@ bing attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence group who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 6@@ 0,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 volunteers are putting their own lives to play in order to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the Ci@@ tizen of Ci@@ vi@@ li@@ zation , showing him a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans the glo@@ wing symbolic figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the recent bom@@ bing attacks in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrels above the Alz@@ adia district , one filled with chlor@@ ine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that not children play with it , &quot; quoted the image of his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to make terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks usually only come to the surface in winter .
after an investigation , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea aboard the research vessel S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks only get offspring with 150 years .
the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes to it , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal reaches a deep 2,6 km / h - and with this top speed it is half as fast as a seal .
this lifestyle , characterized by lon@@ el@@ iness , seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case from a Gr@@ ön@@ land shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland shar@@ ks become stone @-@ old .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks are difficult to observe , after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland .
her slow @-@ motion pent@@ agra@@ ph@@ s measured six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
prey make this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice sea and seek cad@@ a@@ vers tor@@ ped@@ ating from higher water layers down .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland shar@@ ks , who brought fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centi@@ meters long , while the greatest 502 meters measure .
to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens nucle@@ us of shar@@ ks using the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly high carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s as nuclear weapons search for larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centi@@ metres , the lens nucle@@ us contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons tests , which is likely to celebrate its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
in the lens nucle@@ us all larger Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , that result from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 watch for a 4@@ 93 centi@@ meter long Greenland hai showed an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k with 502 centi@@ metres was even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
the researchers were now able to assign an age to the researchers .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters was probably on the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks with the multip@@ lication obviously have at least one and a half centuries time .
this should also be the world record for verteb@@ rates presently .
the fact that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coinci@@ dence .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland w@@ al , in whose bacon on the neck stuck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon point , was caught before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs into flame @-@ flame .
so they mature - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal leaves heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than in one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as soon as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very large animal , on the other hand , should rather invest its resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
in the recent meeting , the municipal council has focused on issues related to building construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the panel highlighted the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently reported housing surfaces can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the sale of land in the residential areas of &quot; road @-@ road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße - expansion section 1 ) , there is nothing more in the way of the sale of the plots in the residential areas of &quot; road @-@ road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the bro@@ oks in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au appeal to young families and former senior citizens alike .
as it was said , Bau@@ wil@@ liger will be able to report to the town hall immediately , about the allocation of the plots , the municipal council is expected to advise in its September session .
in order to be able to fulfil requests to settle other industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipality decided to change the land usage plan newly created in sub @-@ sections only in the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area , which has already been designated there , is extended by two plots in the direction of the state road 21@@ 12 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main , therefore , has the best opportunities to attract more jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very prob@@ able that Frankfurt profits most of the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the competence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether banks should continue to operate from London financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is sufficient for them to be approved in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why they are using large US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; comp@@ utes 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which un@@ ites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities , such as the European Insurance Authority EI@@ O@@ PA and the Risk Council ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its head office , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , but also cuts off the infrastructure as well as Dublin .
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
in addition , the city has an easy @-@ to @-@ reach commercial property .
&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
on the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial properties are 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt bi@@ ds a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the Mer@@ cer management consultancy , the city is ranked seventh , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place .
even if quality of life is a matter of predi@@ ction : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W conclu@@ des .
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my business researchers .
in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead gains legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. attorney decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of the legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was released from a claim for damages amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the inf@@ rin@@ gement of two patents owned by Mer@@ ck , who were in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs called so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after an American judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including his opinion and other un@@ ethical actions .
in the case of a complaint filed on Thursday , U.S. Secretary of Defense Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the reduction of the costs incurred during the defense of the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mer@@ ck tries to balance with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medication which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck def@@ ected mut@@ ually and claimed property on laboratory work containing the bas@@ eline , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have reg@@ ained full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left in the city , said a spokes@@ man for the group on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) go through the city after the ex@@ odus of the still remaining group of fighters that have buried themselves within the city .
they have freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held by the fighters as host@@ ages , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out clean @-@ up operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn $ 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34,@@ 2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the Democrats &apos; candidate for the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former president Bill Clinton saved almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ ars ; former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster &apos;s book on their term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim KA@@ INE in Virginia , published his tax declar@@ ations over the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim KA@@ INE continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign hero Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hid behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ treats in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not obliged by law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business man , and his lawyers have stated as the reason for his refusal to tax audit by tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hero Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter in regards to the publication of the Pres@@ idential candidate of the Democrats .
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump &apos;s special advis@@ er said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before the tax inspec@@ tions are not completed .
m@@ umps critics , among other things the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organizations , his business partners and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the subject and released a video on the internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump calls to publish his tax return .
on Thursday , she addressed the subject also during a speech on the economy of Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s , and a business journalist from the New York Times c@@ ited a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure that people pay the more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka demanded buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had been subjected to a tax audit of the IR@@ S and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fe@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the elec@@ tors and not from tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has been releasing tax return until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons that are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax declaration of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that these were only USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike most Americans .
their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9,@@ 000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ powder , fire@@ works support Tanz@@ anian Ele@@ ph@@ ant prot@@ ector
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from walking in inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ powder .
the method proved to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ Guide Foundation , which had already had the idea for years , has strengthened its promotion along with the U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in Northern Tanzania , to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is the Day of the Day dedicated to the Protection of Animals .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in attitude within these communities , although they are more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ Guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the illumin@@ ating of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown .
ch@@ ili@@ powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition switch .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom cl@@ umps up with a knob and spra@@ ys fine dust at ch@@ ili@@ powder in the air .
a touch is usually already sufficient to chase the elephant .
one last possibility is a thro@@ wer that sho@@ ots a gold fire@@ work in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .
city council unanim@@ ously decides : no g@@ ag @-@ bon@@ ing at St. Go@@ ar Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the St. Go@@ ar investment projects of commercial companies with K@@ us@@ sh@@ land assume - the retail trade in the core capital is considered to be significantly exp@@ ended .
the city council , however , now unanim@@ ously rejected the motion for the new construction of a sales sky on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ k on the Rhine .
&quot; as a matter of principle , we welcome new tra@@ des@@ men , but at this location in exposed position on the banks of the Rhine does not fit this ki@@ osk , &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction .
Jewish director sm@@ ashed Berlin hotel , because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; so@@ lic@@ itation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media clock after he had revealed that the Kemp@@ inski Bri@@ stol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pres@@ election since it had claimed Arabic guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Docum@@ entation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bri@@ stol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last visit Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country code list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ si Bri@@ stol offers an option to select Israel through its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ oked it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said the measure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision from the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large response in the internet where people called it a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel to have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indul@@ ged in the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; shame on you , &quot; it was said in another post in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located in the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dism@@ issed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order to &quot; take Israel into the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung c@@ ited a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotels .
it adds that the country code is now added .
police use tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students joined the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to diver@@ t the students , causing the police to introduce rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the State State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the protest participants were seen by Gra@@ ff@@ iti@@ ts against the preliminary President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the latest protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went into the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dism@@ issed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year .
since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted , the interest on Russian companies in the country grew strongly , divided the amb@@ ass@@ adors .
Russian companies are adop@@ ting existing links with Iran while new firms are willing to get access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trading income between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade swing was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian emb@@ assy issued approximately 3@@ 5,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran has reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something of which the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d that have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses wanted : drink market in Wald@@ br@@ öl to fall
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack has been carried out on Thursday evening on the drink market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
a fire@@ arm contained three dark @-@ dressed people who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , from the employee of the drink market the issu@@ ing of cash and then fled at first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money was captured does the police not share .
the perpet@@ rators are said to have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , which is relatively small .
the drink market is directly accessible and poor@@ ly visible from the park deck of the Re@@ we Market .
after the raid , the perpet@@ rators must be run in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg , and from the gravel car@@ park in front of the park entrance , be pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations for the crime time ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , are urgently required to report to the police .
Nag@@ old : games and fun during summer break
eight beautiful and mer@@ ry days spent the children and youth of the social group / social group work of the child protection federation Nag@@ old with their car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers at their summer release in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quietly situated Frei@@ zei@@ theim Hard@@ t@@ wal@@ del , the life @-@ joyful group was quar@@ rel@@ ed during the first school holiday week .
several full @-@ day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to Bret@@ ten with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo .
on the other way to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group experienced a lot about the daily life and food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group was enjoying the deep lake in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swim and sp@@ lash .
children and car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers with their own prepared dishes such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spoiled .
in workshops , it was possible to create beautiful pieces of jewelry made of beads and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot;
on the day of the journey home , the sun was laugh@@ ing and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : Pil@@ gri@@ m to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the past@@ oral care unit of the E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were handled .
in order to bridge the time to the next roman@@ ian journey of all the mini@@ stri@@ es in the fores@@ ee@@ able two years , the Chief of the Ministers of the Sec@@ ession of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgri@@ ma@@ ges were being tested and one decided finally for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where this year , during the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgri@@ m &apos;s destination was offered at the opening of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Got@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the rooms of the saints , went their way .
in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small ceremony at St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and shared the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing .
from Hor@@ b he was driven by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Mu@@ en@@ ster of Our Lady stood and so the pilgrimage was started from Münster .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short imp@@ etus with various prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is played on field cross@@ ings , chap@@ els or churches every time to sing together a song from specially arranged pilgri@@ m songs .
for the nights , the par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were available .
at the stages Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller supplied a tasty as well as star@@ chy evening meal and breakfast .
on the second day we went on Fur@@ t@@ wan@@ gen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
after that , one stepped on stage to St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous route , but had to desc@@ end at an altitude of about 500 metres in high heat and then climbed again .
the deser@@ ved reward was a bar@@ be@@ que on the bathing pond in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the 4th pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went to Freiburg on the closing stage .
the Min@@ is was visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy later in the afternoon at the Freiburg Mu@@ en@@ ster and went through the door of mercy .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the Men &apos;s Sprint in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British Team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow embar@@ ked on the anch@@ or@@ age that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his own .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after taking a modest sixth place , despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys in March , despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as Hin@@ des .
Ho@@ ys retirement produced a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner were competing in the qualifying rounds , but the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round in the standard rounds .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ des dropped slightly after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hin@@ du drove in a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and to make a name for me .
we set up an Olympic team in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des admitted that he fell on track after a weak start .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no appeal of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we did so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is possible to repeatedly win Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly sacred date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - an output of six gold medals and a silver medal .
that would be the same to Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be ro@@ uted to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the Four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record that won Gold in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he had argued with officials before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and completed tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team is rel@@ ying on its strong train bike team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a host of medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations were shut down for Rio .
Dra@@ mas played in the background , with the resig@@ nation of Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton technical director in April in the middle of S@@ exis@@ mus@@ - und M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ kap@@ fen as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of melt processing of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy yield question@@ able
the future of the aluminium melt of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby elev@@ ates all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company communicated .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a 20 @-@ year subsi@@ dy exp@@ ires in November .
up to 2000 work@@ places in the installation of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to domin@@ oes , since the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total power generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa included the Point Henry M@@ elt , which led to closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows years of spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar , and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ ter with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three more owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Corp. keep smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt mill , &quot; announced the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L also stated that the contracts were called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backup operations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have come into effect from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year will contribute to revenues &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of contracts in its annual closing in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
Al@@ coa declared that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; Al@@ co@@ as &quot; ability to operate the melt or to ensure the electricity supply to the melt &quot; did not imp@@ air .
the US company said it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which should have come into effect from November this year , even if there is still an explanation why it with@@ drew from the contract .
anal@@ ysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt mill in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of the anal@@ ysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts each year and consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner C@@ lans , Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran to the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this verse made me cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans something similar ? ) , sp@@ her@@ ed reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( except for Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n , and in the presence of the most popular show biz @-@ un@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é action of almost every birthday party of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on@@ ess on a TV station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this public@@ ity somehow .
with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began with certainty .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes it , as far as the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most popular edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( According Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the roller 6@@ 15 pp . advertisement ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were still appearing before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
in recent years there were definitely more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; model@@ ed as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover .
Oscar winner and brand ambassador , Jennifer La@@ wr@@ ence , was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the little chance that Ms. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of its generation - falls under the previous category , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everybody .
with their reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers was always a little ten@@ se in the world of fashion .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Sey@@ m@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed them and called them &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ oes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were high again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the mis@@ mo@@ il seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she is selling her made pictures of Cin@@ dy C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is watching reality TV . presum@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
congreg@@ ational centres annually point to 16@@ 0,000 people
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary figures are reported annually by the municipal council centres , while the sector faces the impact of further medium @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no funds for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and similar - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the community , which are already over@@ grown , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
the Director of the City of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Auth@@ orities resulted in thousands of people being rejected each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ aling the government &apos;s decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people from important services you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and overwhelming debt , families who have been dism@@ issed through divisions , workers who have been dism@@ issed un@@ ju@@ stly - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
the German government will cut the funding by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of hel@@ pless people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General and the Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need to get legal problems .
last year , the Land government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of community centers and their communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump Ele@@ ction Camp@@ aig@@ n accused after Emplo@@ ye@@ es allegedly drew weapons
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ action after having been informed that her campaign manager for North Carolina put a fire@@ arm on an employee in February , while they were in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment alleged on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software progra@@ mmer for the campaign in this federal state .
Bord@@ ini admitted to have waited for months that the matter would be internally regulated before he realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot;
the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right index finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the course in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; handed down Bord@@ ini in his indictment .
after compl@@ aining to the local and regional campaign leadership , Bord@@ ini found that at least four other persons had already had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to make harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bord@@ ini admitted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate dis@@ b@@ anded an uph@@ e@@ av@@ al when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment People were to take action if his rival would be elected H@@ illary Clinton and ap@@ point judge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pumps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign clearly showed that the media had torn down his words from the context and that he would not act as violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due di@@ ligence and Philip on bodily injury and permanent psychological harm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ umps press spokes@@ woman hope Hi@@ cks wasn &apos;t available for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
respon@@ ding to calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , was not respon@@ sive .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has previously conducted a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : poll@@ s before State Ele@@ ctions : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) substantial losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U are notable .
this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could rule slightly in the north , this is not possible according to survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to remain the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD collap@@ sed from 35.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party sounded just under the CD@@ U , which could come again to 23 percent .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time on the country &apos;s day .
despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were relu@@ ct@@ ant to return to the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag in spite of slight losses at 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent respectively .
according to the survey in Berlin , according to the survey , the SPD in the survey was only 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it still lies behind the Green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would represent 14 percent for the first time in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would not miss the entrance in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator entered the market .
the success@@ ors are domin@@ ating the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good at hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight Meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would today suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipping with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to the stores exactly 20 years ago - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euros lovers can still purchase the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer trade fair in Hanover as an &quot; office in the western pocket format . &quot;
indeed , the new mobile phone could receive a lot for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to websites was possible via HTML browsers , al@@ beit slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be opened like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was pretty proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. 1400 euro .
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could sense in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything has changed since then .
smart phones are a success story although not for Nokia .
the mobile phone division of Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold and handled by Microsoft .
today , the market is dominated by providers who all came a lot later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is everyday life for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphones in the world .
about 1.4 billion units sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide sales are about 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came in early 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all with touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march began , and today the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ Berry , who dominated the market , had the look .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the legends now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after his invention .
on average every German watches his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to put the Smartphone away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for staff in the Siemens board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to make sure all of our nations and regions were benef@@ iting from the games .
the Olympics brought great advantages to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local congreg@@ ations we will already create 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces alone , create 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the two @-@ fl@@ ers were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers each asked question .
like the Olympics , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , to create £ 211 bn for social growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport and in the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , who has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequent cat@@ walks in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block displays on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ g@@ post where users could update their filters in the program to restart advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop side would change the en@@ coding regarding its advertis@@ ements to make it difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the site is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blo@@ gger , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ forth struggle between the flag@@ rant open source community and the re@@ actors has been in progress since the invention of ad lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators for the industry have become . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use indicators ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users access@@ ing their mobile devices on Facebook , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue tops .
the company adverti@@ ses it on desktop PCs because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertising on desktop PCs is a sufficient amount of revenues , so that Facebook will see the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; Display Award Tool &quot; to give people more control over it .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that adding blocks would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we are planning to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man on Facebook in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a silent means , which is why we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people .
to transfer a woman to the Swiss motorway with presum@@ ed suicide
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police inv@@ oke witnesses after a woman was transferred to a motorway in the early morning hours on Thursday when a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles was committed .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman lay down in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 , who was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police told them as well as every witness of the incident to report .
an investigation was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared with Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a coll@@ ision avoi@@ dable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not being held ac@@ coun@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - where a person ran on the highway in the dark - was decided that drivers must not assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of neg@@ ligence after having passed and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became un@@ conscious on the street , took the court .
the court found that the polic@@ e@@ woman -- respon@@ ding to a distress call -- drove in a justified way -- and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police on 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NA@@ SA Climate model : Venus once hab@@ itable
according to projections of a new NA@@ SA climate model , Venus was probably once inhabit@@ able .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NA@@ SA developed a model to explore the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have recorded similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and yet turned slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to host life and protected from fast ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus show@@ cases its day @-@ side of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; said scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that cooler a few degrees than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , which is similar to evolution previously thought by planetary researchers .
although it was suppos@@ edly inhabit@@ able , Venus -- in the course of several billions years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
her oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and her water vap@@ or was burnt out of ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide came back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy returns as coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as a trainer and vice president of ho@@ ckey operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to a low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; commented the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
during the summer , I &apos;ve been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth that it needs and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not met at the moment .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and we wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the Best Train@@ ers of the League during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as winner of the Jack Adams Award .
he led the club on 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches scored a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell into five points behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two tracks with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ el@@ ink@@ ers res@@ ume negotiations , strike out strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles with regard to the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the armed parties sit down at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the petro@@ leum field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions , can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the present strike , &quot; stated in a joint statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will keep a few full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , starting next year to restart the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has short@@ ened the rates to its counter@@ parts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s advice follows a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts to the company give the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has fired many thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ re@@ unification with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure because of the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which had intensi@@ fied by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 fewer than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend more than $ 1.4 billion in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars rot@@ ates in the star cluster to different rates , and in which context the rot@@ ational periods are related to planetary formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star cluster , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infrar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the earth .
many stars in this cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
to top rot@@ ational rates , these ri@@ pen@@ ing stars exc@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the stars of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is aged , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star , recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars are more slowly turning slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , whereby bigger stars turn slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older ones , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is still a lot ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how the how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational marri@@ ages and so to speak their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eb@@ all star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eb@@ all star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will wear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has given him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid back for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he made some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall of F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two additional bas@@ eb@@ all players have similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 year old should not be included in the bas@@ eb@@ all &apos;s hall of fame .
because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was in the field so controversial its appearance outside the square .
in 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was blocked for 211 games due to involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the prime suspect to have received funding from an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for years .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could have done a favour for 2014 , as I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his f@@ arewell @-@ days do not run no@@ is@@ elessly .
while many bas@@ eb@@ all legends in their last games get the big stage , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; et@@ ched Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson said , sympathy and sympathy of fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ ale Boston red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; the supporters of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ eko@@ wa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
wi@@ pes : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland may not start in Rio .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official dop@@ ing cas@@ u@@ alties .
an athle@@ tic ath@@ l@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing attacks have become known for the Rio de Jan@@ eiro 2016 Olympic Games .
Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacle course in Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ovi@@ wa from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately prior to the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions these news came to the fore .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de di@@ ure@@ tic has been demonstrated last Sunday that is used as a m@@ asked agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the CAS confirmed its exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had reserved the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en should have been able to take part in more than 50 metres of Freestyle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing has applied for the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national association took the matter &quot; very seriously and demands fruitful cooperation with the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work together with the International Sport Court in CAS and will accept the verdi@@ ct . &quot;
for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for sanc@@ tioning athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news about the positive test at Dan@@ eko@@ wa passed , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive himself .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the bi@@ dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O should act in the forbidden substance .
Dan@@ ovi@@ wa has been suspended pro@@ vision@@ ally , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ specimen should have already been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boy@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately contacted the ath@@ l@@ ete with criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nations may not participate in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ on three days earlier .
both disp@@ el the intake , however , both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , especially the case Dan@@ ovi@@ wa is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Federation IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian squ@@ ad to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , also the nation of Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the former off@@ ences in China had also taken care of violent confron@@ tations between the athletes .
Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ ed purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun also focused on a confron@@ tation with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 Sun had been positively tested by the Chinese nationals for the stimul@@ ant of the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ dine , but only a three month lock was needed .
data cl@@ aw : h@@ ack@@ ers black@@ mail their ran@@ som
programm@@ ers of black@@ mail malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey conducted by the malware Ab@@ wehr specialists , Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , sometimes several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany nearly 20 per cent of the companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims were willing to use the solutions required by the offen@@ ders to re@@ use the systems and data challenged .
the offen@@ ders speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations by Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes in particular on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially high @-@ resolution ran@@ som will be considerably higher than for private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling fast evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes leader Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ utilities were still designed to send advertis@@ ements .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks resulted in a start@@ ling fast in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware uses a simple pattern : once active on the computer of an victim , it searches for recently changed files , such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as for archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where private users are using the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without the production still being shut down .
correspon@@ d@@ ingly higher the damage is caused by a ran@@ som@@ ware .
22 per cent of the German companies reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to inter@@ rupt their business activities , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks which may be threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators in the wake of stand@@ still in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a type of customer service in order to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files .
and if private persons are released after payment of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit amounts in order to retri@@ eve their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potential high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and share their work , explains Security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within one week . &quot;
however , it is more prob@@ able that it is three or four persons .
the programm@@ ers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular box to the actual black@@ mail@@ ers .
the malware kit so far originated by buying malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price of $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
the black@@ mail@@ ers are looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per computer@@ ised computer .
&quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust that ran@@ som@@ ware can be aver@@ ted by file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful shooting , the offen@@ ders face the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes leader Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the potential for damage depends on the type of data to be much higher than before .
in future , the perpet@@ rators will also be able to take completely new targets on the net of things in the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get under their control a thermo@@ stat connected with the Internet .
in the middle of winter , the release of such blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rators then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1,60 m high HR @-@ V looks rather small , the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it does not work in any place .
the interior materials are well finished and pleasant , only the upper side of the cockpit is a bit different .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage space .
there is not only a luggage compartment of 45@@ 3 l with high @-@ quality and 10@@ 26 l with revers@@ ed back rests , but there is the Magic Se@@ ats .
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like a n@@ ettle and thus offer storage space , which is high from the ground up to ceiling 1,@@ 24 m .
the boot can be loaded easily , but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates HR @-@ V with torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he is likely to do a bit qui@@ eter for his job .
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gra@@ ti@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; driving is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City Emer@@ gency Brake Ass@@ ist ( operates to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
the coll@@ ision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the remote assistant is very reliable .
and the intelligent speed controller respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if necessary .
but the full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device integration and more .
two US@@ B- and one HDMI @-@ jack are underneath the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel is fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines meet the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not responsible for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) ar@@ gues that any liability is conceivable only in case of risks that are typical of air traffic .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee cap when falling .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
illness : when pays the organiz@@ er
after their trip , people with ill vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back when the cause of the disease is indisp@@ ut@@ ably found in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the case of the case , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their Turks .
she spent most of the vacation in the room .
their illness brought the holi@@ day@@ makers back to a defective wast@@ ewater treatment that suppos@@ edly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family thought that the trip was lacking - and compl@@ ained to the organis@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
indeed , the wast@@ ewater treatment plant was in fact defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it just before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then , he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duties of information , so the judgment .
especially since no contamination was found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to react to terror threats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
if criminals would have to leave the country more quickly , it would increase the security and also the approval of the people for refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to implement the proposals to the 2017 Parliament election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over several years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be under punishment again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance aims to improve the state of arms in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the internet is particularly difficult .
the last much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors should remain after the Mai@@ zi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the doctors , how the danger of citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister considers better social care necessary .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of conce@@ aled investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Gabriel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister has clearly expressed himself against action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double citizenship .
he considers a general ban on fully @-@ conce@@ al@@ ment in constitutional law .
you can &apos;t ban everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
one could talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
the minister of green , Simone Peter , accused the minister that he wanted to simul@@ ate energy and action with new anti @-@ terrorist acts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ fle@@ inger said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fle@@ et pro@@ verb@@ s and a sharpen@@ ing of the right to stay do not bring people in this country any more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic on the motorway
it regularly takes a look at the b@@ ypass road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
but that is to change : the right @-@ to @-@ right balance should be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic on the ambient street every night in traffic jams if they drive via the motorway ( A 43 ) .
the road construction will be extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 @-@ 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Road and exit Wes@@ eler Straße at 700 meters .
drivers can then cycle directly from the Hammer Road to the right .
the major advantage : the traffic is sharing early on , whereby the overall process is improved on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district representing Münster @-@ West .
the train ride on the fe@@ eder gets nervous the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days the back @-@ traffic reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h way and sometimes beyond .
the reason for this is the needle eye on B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic is only lowered single @-@ lane over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back more than three quarters of years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity to record the heavy load traffic two @-@ lane .
the competent regional company cannot say how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated lab@@ orious con@@ ges@@ tion will last .
however , with years to reck@@ on , the bridge has an official remain@@ der of use until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal department , the state company deliberately chose the busi@@ est time during the school holidays because of disability to be reck@@ oned with .
traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association supports young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Mu@@ en@@ ster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the young theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s Association , 19 students visited the st@@ aging of the Small House between eleven and 15 years .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most of the young people of the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , such as the press release of the young theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will receive the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical language transmission are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
given the rise in refugee numbers , the association counts with many classes that want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather changed the star @-@ sni@@ ff @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany on Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was badly suitable for clouds and rain to watch the sky spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky .
the star @-@ scales are Pers@@ ei@@ ds , which with 216@@ ,000 kilometers per hour belong to the quick@@ est shooting stars .
they have their name because they apparently come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces
in the evening , one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep well before the wake @-@ up ring@@ ing .
it is all other than relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how can sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there can be many causes to them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , member of the board of the German Society of Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what one inevitably understands , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , that is , a sleep @-@ in and through @-@ sleep disorder .
especially the sleeping feel many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the board of the German House physician association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
this can lead to organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
in@@ frequently , sleeping disorder is an expression of another condition .
&quot; very early awakening is especially frequent in depression , &quot; says We@@ eks .
and it can be that different factors op@@ press each other .
anyone who has a disk failure , for example , can lie badly , wo@@ ke up every two to three hours , and possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces become a doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , says We@@ eks .
the impair@@ ment may look very different : one is tired , tired , un@@ rested , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or even medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
there is barely conce@@ aled sleep medi@@ ator in Germany , says Professor Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Sle@@ eping Medicine Centre at the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin .
for this reason , when sleeping problems , one should first turn to the primary doctor , says Weber .
this can be clari@@ fied by exam@@ ining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should come to sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for exam@@ ining in the sleep laboratory , doctors , for example , advise in snor@@ ing with respiratory stimul@@ ators , in case of sick day fatigue , in sleeping trans@@ duc@@ ers , or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder , Fi@@ etze explains .
it is actually not necessary to prepare for the study .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the c@@ abling you go to bed at the normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger .
in addition , a camera draws the sleeping bag on the ceiling .
how can people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few screws on which one can set for a better sleep .
we@@ aving counts : regular sleeping and sleeping hours , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and don &apos;t watch out at night at night - then you start to count at once , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to offer
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ ap@@ point the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he made gold for the first time at the short track championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V ath@@ l@@ ete Markus Dei@@ bler has released himself in front of his ex @-@ team mates who stood in the cri@@ tique .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 Euros and a jungle King 15@@ 0,000 € no one should be surprised about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page during the night .
the transport system in the swimming sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls , on the other hand , are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see or even operate dop@@ ing so closely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be registered for nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; if you are not able to control a certain amount of time before WM / OS by independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you must not take part , &quot; the election ham@@ burger , who now operates an ice cream shop .
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage Speci@@ es arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , the police arrested two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years of age .
as a gang of susp@@ ects , the susp@@ ects committed several pocket and baggage ste@@ els .
at 9 : 30 pm civilian officials in the area of the airport Dus@@ sel@@ dorf recognised a gang that was known to the police officers from past th@@ ef@@ acts .
the two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid @-@ July and were in a community , social and professional manner .
the Speci@@ alists of the Cri@@ min@@ ative Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can prove four acts to the thi@@ eves who had been en@@ rolled for off@@ ences to Germany .
in the process , they had captured over 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , some lime trees , in between still a rest cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the R@@ ī@@ ga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem so at first sight , but the police counts it to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one walks along the road from the east to the west , one passes at play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house .
opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is also soon to be dem@@ ol@@ ished , it is already built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be created here .
articles about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate agency Friedrichsha@@ in calls , are however preferred in recent weeks with burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , now the inhabitants have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Henkel has expressed itself several times for a hard action of the police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after the police pat@@ rol the rooms on the ground floor , the Ka@@ det for@@ ge , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ ro@@ wed three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 police officers and three crew members on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers were commissioned by the unknown owner to the premises .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers with@@ drew from the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street looks peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about late .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who trains three children here , are mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house @-@ projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , which mostly wanted police protection against v@@ andal@@ ous lef@@ ti@@ sts .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin internal organiz@@ er and the police make up between occup@@ ants and their neighbors , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; quarter , which today also has a low average income in comparison to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty .
house occupied and the resulting residential projects have long been part of the neighborhood : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire Main Street very close to Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under high police regulations in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world in recent years : residents of East Germany and former home occup@@ iers share their neighbourhood with them .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them on the disc@@ arded disks or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were disc@@ arded with paint @-@ bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year as often as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lef@@ tist violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as bodily injury are according to statistics almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
most of the off@@ ences make property damage , which tend to meet the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94 , there can be no question of in@@ security .
as for acts of violence , it is weigh@@ ty : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , they are certainly not .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er region any longer .
for the studied architect her street is not a criminal &quot; focal point , &quot; on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately drawn into the Riga @-@ Strasse - and has remained .
that &apos;s why it was so important for her to get back to her streets : from the police , the politics and the media , all of a sudden the interpretation of the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new buildings in former mos@@ quit@@ oes that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well affected are living here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should we do if someone never stops ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those tra@@ iled by color @-@ bombs . the house @-@ projects and the left @-@ scene belonged to the neighbourhood .
those who come from should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub area , who can &apos;t complain about noise .
all persons presented with first names have asked to not be named with their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees himself as a contact person for all players : refugees , refugee aid workers , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine Customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ins@@ ul@@ ting Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which has a problem above all .
thus some - less mo@@ cking but rather focused on the multitude of desired areas of task - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
we were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just an urgent Woll@@ sm@@ sau .
but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent place for three years limited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
soon new containers stand in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
you will have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises .
the municipalities themselves must bear the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations .
the responsibility shifts from the administrative office to the municipality and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de fac@@ to the administration does not find private apartments .
so far it doesn &apos;t work , so it is necessary to rely on private flats , according to Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , community apartments need to be re@@ designed as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are set up in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a solid lead , there are intern@@ ship plac@@ ements , training places , scho@@ oling , one @-@ Euro @-@ jobs and remedi@@ al activities for refugees and migrants who have to be gro@@ unded or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
that is not employment therapy . &quot;
but activity doesn &apos;t just mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , says Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need special offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here , too , administration and volunteers are jumping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain to the refugees that it takes a long time and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
anyone who will develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there are problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing works &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : are the two following the latest events fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer clearly , &quot; what some na@@ ï@@ ve name might be . &quot; however , a residual risk could and would not exclude them .
but the hel@@ pers are sensi@@ ti@@ zed already .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins would call them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with that , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and hon@@ orary members must look for activities on the spot and in the region .
they are always in the background that soon a new push to refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid .
actually it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way .
currently there are around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there is no simple answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chim@@ ney : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicopter looked for
the police helicopter flew in different areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were forced into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in Lin@@ den@@ weg on Friday morning .
the inhabitants surprised the two and beat the monsters in their escape .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably m@@ asked , both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black ho@@ o@@ ded pul@@ ls were wearing .
they fled to the city centre .
at the same time , the police set up several squ@@ ad cre@@ ws as well as a police helicopter .
the search went without success .
perhaps the unknown ones did not fall close to the apartment or in their flight .
