<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer visited with some colleagues a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their work, they hunted back home to the feed in a quick gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">A kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the riding career finished already again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself lead with his family about the system of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even swell for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed over the gold sports pyramid to the man from Anhausen in the course of a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">League Cross, Silver Laurel leaf, Champions Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "" "" "says Langer," "" "" "" "it is not only awarded for sporting successes but also for social commitment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he also received the prize money of 25,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the Hall of Fame of German Sports.</seg>
<seg id="24">The winners include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the real Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, the boar rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum the handball Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of those sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrious company migrated to the jumping arena where the Lavazza price was running.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade deal - both Clinton and Trump want to.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are not one in the tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a more basic philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep this in doubt rather small and warns of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be completely different, claims trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will massively repel regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks; it has disadvantaged chances to open up and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would increase, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In which must be invested, Trump and Clinton almost say word-synchronized.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the democratic candidate is even announcing the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are rejected by the state-critical teapy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on trump there could still be party-internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Distinctions are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production is also to be possible in previously protected areas, it wants to announce the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "with its investment programme, Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energies and demand:" "" "" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, do not want to sign both." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the United States from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid better, Clinton says.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says he cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the one hand stands Trump who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics suggest that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton, who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is an area manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are chicken.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralised accommodations for fully-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs has set up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Assistance.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently, it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not as a visitor either.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>

<seg id="26">This drives them away.</seg>

<seg id="36">Since they often don't know how to help, they need more accommodation just for them, ask Bahr.</seg>

<seg id="39">In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia there is no such thing in accommodations of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabia, refugees alone are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia, there are in some common shelters floors or own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputy members of the Registrar have called upon their union to approve new work campaign measures in their disputes concerning a new contract.</seg>

<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg's Palace, I can't resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was narrolipply and he barely exuded warmth, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" "" "" "" "dear friend" "" "" "" "Putin - according to a report a whole five times." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the downstream of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to that time was rage-burning.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin announced and accused Ankara of having fallen in the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the veto is difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of senior officers that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin obtained the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs primarily all the friends he can get after spending the last month with a failed coup d'état of almost his office.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are economic motives too.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia tour operators and charter companies will be relieved if the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-eastward rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this week the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed again." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious on the West as it regards its response to the attempted transfer of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the continued grudge on the gastroentempo of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian head of state secured a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray an "alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once described to me: two countries that have been violated and badly treated by the West and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference expressed that they hadn't even understood the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to stress that." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State will at least talk to each other.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia's Putin moist Sergei Ivanov chief of staff</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin recently dismissed Sergei Ivanov's Chief of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was part of Putin's narrowest trust group for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed special commissioner for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement of the Kremlin, Putin stated that without stating reasons "the dismissal Ivanovs ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy director since 2012, was named his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website it means (in Russian) that he later became protocol director and head of the government son.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he said about his appointment to Putin:" "" "" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think it is the government's most important task to support your activity as Head of State in respect of bills and controls to implement your instructions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin announced on Friday the Russian TV broadcaster that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convinced?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants for a long time and works as he was for the Soviet Intelligence Service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men asserted that the Chief of Staff resigns at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, just a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the consequence of a sort of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who was once touted as a potential president at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said it is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - I could almost say - trusting - bursting posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration since four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin served as President of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov became his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin arrived at power he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term of office, as a third term of Putin had violated the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, approaching ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president for three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensbury crossings with the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four closings to the "deck blower" approaching each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 oblique ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensbury crossings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, nearly 79% of the bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete deck in Rosyth for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first fastener represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the North tower deck, we had to close the gap to the north or agricultural side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern tributary bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards with an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">As the tolerances on which the team worked, they were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres.</seg>

<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1,300 affordable apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD is proposing a "living room concept for living" at the next council meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But quarrel is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">The leader of the SPD, Christoph Bratmann, believes: "we agree with the Greens:" if you want to build on urban areas, in future 20 percent of all apartments must be dealt with as social housing. "</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can, however, also arise in the inventory.</seg>

<seg id="14">The CDU aims to provide investors with as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of what kind of Bratmann, an intensification of the situation on the housing market appears.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not yet entirely: because the roughly 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">How can we compare the loss of other around 1300 affordable housing units, whose funding will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, according to Nicole Palm, planning policy spokesperson should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought of bringing homes back into price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved at one blow.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western part of the year, the end of the year runs out.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for affordable apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western part of the West is drastically increased, it is removed from the goal of the so-called mashing.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged neighborhoods in just a few districts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch the world changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children are no longer going outside, but rather prefer spending their free time on screens has been lamented by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about catching people from the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then videogames and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the publication of the game sank in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand overloaded by the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (using a screenshot on the mobile) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the jahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person puts back every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which followed 35,000 users recently, announced the Washington Post recently that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of follow-up people, which train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely looks the raw data for the increase in performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to take "30 minutes to take" away from the sofa "and" be active every day "hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and coming from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of contracting cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that is fun for them.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also Mürrische gamers who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it like?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be decreased with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with assets in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to become more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and Final Five "team mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner, Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Bales turnt on the Swedish bar during the Winter Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years her sport, 15 world championships - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said that she is the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>

<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has not lost a competition for competition, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafa was easily led by two turns, the picture was deceiving.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish beams and floor gymnastics - in which Biles holds the world champion title - lurked.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and on the floor with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently when she expected her end - a pure formality - and tears flowed on biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake passed to Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old female team, called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her exercise she threw Kushems to the public, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the Women's Olympic Championship in the Turning and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, which is Aly Raisman, the Jew and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts has been an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America was cheering.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they expected unexpected but masterful Gymastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual competition for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we don't see gymnasiums in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to get into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last five," because the next Olympic Championship will only have four riders in the team.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnasiums are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started practicing gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have to encourage the municipalities to countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to make a more affordable and easy-to-access gymnastics workout possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my turn-foundation 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable Turns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teenagers (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to take part in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" through the holing of the Olympic team gold and thank you for being motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way, to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted for a vote rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July Hunt's plans revealed to forcibly introduce the treaty and said that the NHS was found in a "niemandsland" and that any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the Chairman of the BMA Committee for Registrar, announced last night in a communication with: "Registrar have had serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will heat up the current occupation crisis and it will be abused to treat all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">In just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors drop under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes met with the government for reluctance to engage and sometimes deafening silence.</seg>

<seg id="17">Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those who come back from a professional training period, training kolog, mutual recognition of curriculum, advanced training and the gender Ministry regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May were.</seg>

<seg id="3">The anti-inflammatory drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="7">Approximately 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls, which form layers.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the surface breaks apart, it can cause a blood clots that clog the blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots dissolve, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The preliminary draft of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with an aspirin twice daily intake for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of NICE Health Technology Assessment Center said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this.</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness makes electoral fraud in Muslim areas blooming</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year for corruption from office due to corruption</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored, as a crushing government report today disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles attacks the police, election observers and town halls to have ignored proof of electoral abuse due to "oversensitivity to Ethnie and Religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an anti-corruption, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers out of voting cabins to protect intimidated voters.</seg>

<seg id="7">At the moment a voter only has to name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to apply non-removable ink to a person's finger when they release their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">He demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions from unofficial committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this not only serves against electoral fraud, but also aims to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet Wahlskandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special indiscriminate court decided that the incumbent mayor Luton Rahman should be relieved of corrupt and illegal practices of his office after a litany.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found Rahman perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical manner," and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "Rahman is said to have led" "" "" "" "his campaign on the basis of the religious duty of Muslims to elect him." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of imitation in which a person chooses to be someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed himself particularly alarming to the fraudulent election - with the older members of the Muslim community putting pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including running out ID to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report, it says: "as evidence has been applied to pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people to choose according to the will of elders, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.</seg>

<seg id="2">The outside world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn around the skewer for your predator.</seg>
<seg id="5">When you approach you from behind, you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and "move out of the line," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then hit him with his knees in the bar and twist while the attacker hurries before pain, the weapon from his hands. strike him with the barrel into the face and move backwards while they direct the weapon to him.</seg>
<seg id="8">In case of attackers approaching from the front, technique is similar - move your body from the firing line, grab the gun and twist it, so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon from his grip before moving backwards and the weapon hits him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly what Mizrachi is doing.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler underwent a serious test of his immune system and sausage lex by leveraging some of the dirtiest and most disgusting locations in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk aborted his train to Piccadilly Circus, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing knob of a tensile toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before levering any object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will let himself be.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of leaking the rinsing knob of a pull-out toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical experts about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left behind what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestines by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public banisters to railway stations to purge pots of toilets, the task put his immune system definitely under a test</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was definitely justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample screed showed a luminescence value of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometric value of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their luminaires were over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "in the film he says:" "" "" "" "that comes close to the worst I have done in a toilet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to dock here, because it's disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the fostering of gut bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valio Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended with saying" "" "" "" "Let's call Ian." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide the consumer with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film directing, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick it and others where it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015 84 percent of all respondents associate lactic acid bacteria particularly with the wellbeing of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing accompanying lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social flat after a delogation of £50,000 because it had terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">Having been forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had holes, logs were opened, garbage was strewn on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been moved and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people do not have to live in this way." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said the terror that the family had added, street fights with baseball slumbers, intimidated residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, quarrels and curses.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the lease agreement, was an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which can be torn down, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the property in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden boards were torn</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours told us that they saw them fighting on the street and had to call the police on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing signed a forcible transfer from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogation was cheered by lightened neighbours who said that their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "one of them said," "" "" "" "They were not afraid of anyone." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived next to them 20 years and it was always bad.</seg>

<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now, where they are finally gone, it will become beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have arranged the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, 20 years long.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the village house, rubbish and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the tenant looses to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family, as delogation is always the last step into consideration of Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horribly included for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have gracefully approached us and gave us the information we have provided.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will offer comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress, which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogation on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers in the house administration will now have to evacuate garbage mountains surrounding the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash at £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine after having found himself guilty of owning a class B drug in commercial intent.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 at a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="37">Having been without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police says that they will be delogged renters who do not comply with the rules of the house</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police informed that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not comply with the rules of the house.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this goes to those who think they can act without self-reproach as well as to those who have been harmed by such behavior," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="4">The Air Force admitted that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk</seg>
<seg id="5">This was the moment in which scary tourists start to panic after a bushing jet crashes over a full beach.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost close to the beach in Aveiro in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="7">The holidaymakers sprang up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what came through the clouds.</seg>
<seg id="8">The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.</seg>
<seg id="9">Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said: "it flew very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."</seg>
<seg id="10">Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me."</seg>
<seg id="11">Tourists at the beach of Aveiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and unbelievably deep flew.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so low that this was the only way to recognize them.</seg>
<seg id="13">The spokesman said that due to the poor visibility of the area around the area, the jet flew somewhat lower than usual, but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time at risk.</seg>
<seg id="14">Area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where also four people on the island Madeira came to death.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly as low as possible due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke - which limits his view.</seg>

<seg id="15">According to media reports, he is said to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">For a long time, Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC following numerous doping offences.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls submitted by the IOC in front of the Rio Games, it was previously pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic beginning.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, the WADA Kenyan from the list of countries whose doping control was compliant with the rules of WADA.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is considered a great runner-nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a number of TV reports the ARD has repeatedly allegated that doping remedies are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant mentality of sports betting.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar study in Kenya as he had employed in Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has been proven that this kind of sport has been covered in a widespread and systematic way.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia should not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the country code will not be held right at the end of summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because stupid as far it is not: summer holidays, heat and land election campaign - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the locals, who are to be persuaded by the election fighters, are on vacation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers travelling in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so you can't choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: in the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count on the end of the vote, only laboriously apply.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign just close to the people over themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase when you can say that at all has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly lagging behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is exciting how strongly Neuling AfD intersects and what remains at the end of coalition dust.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost unobtrusive campaign of election, one sees from his large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and chatting a bit with the people, just as it did his legendary password-carer predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise pastors got cold feet and chancellor Merkel is blaming the blossoming of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "her refugee policy, her" "" "" "" "We create that" "" "" "" "accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the interior minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make electoral campaigns at the right time at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to open up mass demonstrations; Angela Merkel is lying in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group was not right, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "" "", "lamented Vincent Kokert, secretary general of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Northeast CDU largely eliminates the usual electoral competition on market places and in front of shopping centers with parasols and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "that," "" "" "" "Kokert, plays only a minor role." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Union also noted that in the country you crumble the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">You are going on like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly any in the expanses of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">But the advice of the CDU voter Kokert to his comrades is also self-revealing: "you have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, the small party with seven percent in polls, are likely to make the leap into the land day.</seg>
<seg id="32">From holiday poverty, they make a modern virtue and expose their election campaign largely to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign" calls it the national president Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green election fighters go for search for native voters among holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curvens with a houseboat through the lakes of Mecklenburg and finds it even beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="1">B27-Refurbishment: restaurants suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is refurbished.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those who are in charge of the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end at 8 p.m., there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything pretty shaky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet petrol station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be moved to the south on a scheduled basis at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be finished.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is also said to be the accomplice of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of insistence entrances.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and also the interruption of the Aspergasse in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg became again, the traffic situation within the town was relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The softer traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable discomfort," says the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachelstrasse, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping trails were looking for and more trusting their navi than the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks fit into residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were not met, the municipality reinforced the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable exceedances," says King, who expressed himself about the situation even on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been blotted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the road with 77 hours kilometers in the tempo-30-zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen on the B 27, it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg, the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to revenue disbursts lets everyone look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. for other companies, have hardly any consequences for the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even at the dealership Maier Thomas Sulz talks about a "most light drop," but also admits that, of course, "running documents are missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the locals along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it" "" "" "" "hard." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "he estimates sales losses to" "" "" "" "far above 50 percent" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "the road-landing took its operation" "" "" "" "back for two years." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to dismiss the half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation with the hint that the restaurant otherwise would benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages that arise from the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">GÖHNER knows from other counties where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715, and refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complicated traffic management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot approach, it is also very different.</seg>
<seg id="42">He has no doubts that his stem-clause comes back at the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, that's brutal.</seg>

<seg id="19">The Maizière also presents a few new ideas.</seg>
<seg id="20">They are part of it: he plans fast-screening procedures for deportations and more opportunities for detaining people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a safety check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Dulce for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to face some worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to mask their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of it is politically and legally uncle.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some things are still unbalanced and open questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the unequal treatment of patient - for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics refugees and terror." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to say that the ambassadors of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, in the face of the high refugee figures, many people were worried about security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people deeply concerned were not allowed to clap in election campaign times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security has moved enormously.</seg>

<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen has been manipulating abortion tests with a software.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million cars to convert into workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of the retrofitting, VW reaffirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After changing the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.</seg>
<seg id="23">After retrofitting, the tollbooth will provide customers with a "guarantee" certification, but do not speak of a "guarantee" as was the case on Friday in corporate circles.</seg>

<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was in business circles.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "guarantee" Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example, half a year after the upgrade, customers can come into a workshop with engine damage - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Also in the interests of customers, it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, there is to be an uncertainty about possible warranty rules as it was called.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is why VW does not use the term "guarantee."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who purchases vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men average age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before moving to the comment section to see him under the pseudonym "NonAlleeinsperger" age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the reemergence of sound boards is not a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but rather to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are Yougov's results correct?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I run in the midst of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and graze wildly before I stand, hold my hands and say something better: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic board specialist shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part where I stand in direct proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, from Sister Ray (data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably about the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60's, early 70" "" "" "", "appeared when I was 11 or 12." "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the Yougov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pub, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people usually have been discharged from their collection by 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers received an impetus from the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that evoke happy memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "" "" "says WEZ." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">It's like a collector so and I think it's so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "" "" "an employee flees from a deck stack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried while browsing through a stack of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead acoustic board so I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-grade, less musicwise.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "we have people who say:" "" "" "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly enter.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the sound board, has an entertaining audience when I enter.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sexed pop instead of experimental jazz drumming from loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity in the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but nagging psychic traumas are hard to detach when standing next to someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around the shop for a few minutes and examines the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more of a window-shop than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not earn much, so collecting records is not a real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives away with a loving sighs.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of turnkey enthusiasts: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">As I give the impression to pattern the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research showed that the results of Yougov vote, they, at least in Plattenhäutigen in Soho, do not take into account the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, plate stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with certainty not by strolling through platstings of Berwick Street and the leaves through records, while they avoid the staring gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old wrong moderator who runs over the shoulders of no middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional businesses and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week the authorities argued in Calais that the state should be authorised to submit 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hair services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and which would have a risk of fire and quality.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the government-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than feed only people living in extremely precarious conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the tearing was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the camp, which is co-operated and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-year rugby in the final on Thursday evening came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a master class in handling, side stepping, back, line and raw power to win Gold - its first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was swept through the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth on that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The significant defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of this, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one breite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck: Fijis head trainer Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost every match at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This flap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began marvelous and racked the GBs' attacks from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. on, as if you were running in driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to top, as Osea Kolinisau passed down in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes of playing Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner, which he changed.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A protracted Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, jasa Veremalua lete a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided weak Tacklings of the UK team and stormed to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji would have been born to play 7 while GB is still to be learned.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favor of the South Korean, whose fans sang, swung flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach to Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle rang out, the Fijis embraced and GB tipped crushing in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan had defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a scarce half-finalmatch of the race - Great Britain's conversion of difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the boats in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, Anthony of the British 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all their 39,000 failed deployment, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlets, gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental advances that make the difference and there was no other assistant than the coach who did not know before 30 months whether he would survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that's what they did.</seg>

<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the break down to a minimum, in case that was the correct term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but it makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a rainy morning doing something more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I was an emotional wreck this week, but it means so much." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeats how much this means to me how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning never lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very trapped at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "remain in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we didn't look out to make any rabies.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want a firework today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic champion.</seg>

<seg id="2">The managing director of the Veitensteingruppe "Veitensteingruppe," Ruppert Göller, is retiring.</seg>
<seg id="3">The association is considered "Bavarian" exemplary. "</seg>
<seg id="4">A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">So ago it was in the original tone in an article of the Bayerischer Rundfunk.</seg>
<seg id="6">A little later, the water forum of the Lower Franconia Government honoured the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="7">The work of the Veitensteingruppe "Bavarian" is considered exemplary. "</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the company of Zweckverband, stands for 28 years as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Drinking Water Authority of the Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, annually supports about 150,000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities of Kirchstraße, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach are members of the municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current Chairman, Breitbrunner Bürgermeisterin Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert was appointed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckbanen in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work through office and organizational activities, budgetary planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), real estate purchases in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high canister (1999), the acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was no stalemate and I always added innovations because water is the main food and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In their laudation, Göllers praised the faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He used a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he settled the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, he was a real practitioner to present the success concept of the Veitensteingruppe as a nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of Lower Franconia.</seg>
<seg id="20">For that he received a lot of praise and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller praised water wart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water wart and he was a faithful crap.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">The highlights from his point of view were the fountain building and the restructuring of the Zweckbanen.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were the burglary on the high canister at church louder on a third of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">One can only maintain the supply of Neubrunn, because one filled the high canister from Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">STAHL - Lichtblick for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions of euros.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from the green electricity promotion are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the release of the Renewable Energy Umbearing in the existing plants for so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry, Federal Minister of Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), said the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am really glad that we could finally reach that after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers that use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry was threatening additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ, now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissar Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy of 20 percent applies.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on self-electricity production." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In this way, the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined.</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in view of our campaign" "" "" "" "steel is the future" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"more must follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "also with the reform of the emissions legislation, climate and employment targets are to be weighed," "" "" "", "said IG Metall-chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and a considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation was further exacerbated when the world's largest producer of China cast massive steel to the world market in light of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers reproach Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel impact, on the other hand, the economic outlook in China is brightened.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">German industry priest Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the end, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual plants.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 860,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July German steel producers are cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, just as the German economic association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short upliftment in May, the produced quantity returned to the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has risen by two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing good seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has accompanied Ursel Kipp for her whole life: she was a young girl in the school choir, in Lehramt he studied music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physical," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good with her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler of Deutsche Seniorenliga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and cultivate social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Often social and family structures dissolve in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ursel Kipp has also made this experience in her choir: "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly require their lungs are not so quickly out of the box in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft (Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft) for senior citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, it explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive emotions of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies themselves, people with dementia are sinking back to long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head is also demanding a special performance, Lenz says.</seg>
<seg id="20">Focusing on one's voice and rhythm at the same time and adapting to the other singers - that's a big cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone are practicing so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I do something for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are plenty of good reasons to start singing.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz recommends.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">On the search for the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings among the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the internet, your family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with the Internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Whoever wants to sing should definitely join a choir, he advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="3">To their surprise, the males also did not leave the males cold - however, they always behaved the same in contrast to the females.</seg>

<seg id="8">She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous examination, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens-cries differ with the urgency of their need for help.</seg>

<seg id="4">It was planned for the beginning of September.</seg>

<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities, such as waste." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">At 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin was first exploded on Thursday evening in a Nightlife two bombs.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning two explosives went up again, and another man was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb explosion was also reported in the morning by Phuket.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured during the detonation near the popular seaside resort Patong.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive rate had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwestern coast and in Chumphon on the south-eastern coast were demanding several injuries.</seg>
<seg id="15">From a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript," said army general Danai Kritmethavee Freiburg on Friday morning.</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is too early to comment on possible motifs - but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that are typical for the bombing rate of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist insurgency movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is only local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "" "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days the authorities would have received secret references to forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed of the exact date and the places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police told their officials across the country to reinforce security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are again and again smaller bombings, but mostly they are not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin lies a palace that was used over the years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>

<seg id="33">This gives the military a great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create mayhem, while the country moves towards stability, improvement of economic situation and tourism.</seg>

<seg id="36">However, the military hasn't managed to get a grip on the revolving uprising of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympic medallists or world records set the headlines at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>

<seg id="1">As of October 1, 2016, the fees per cubic meter waste water amount to 2.10 Euro for the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welthahl 3,44 Euro; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3,36 Euro (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euro (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the facility in Azendorf the waste water fee will be increased by the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a pertinent calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf is then at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, it was noted in the approval of the budget by the administrative office Kulmbach that undercover for these sewage installations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost-efficient manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, citizens as well as industrial and industrial companies from Welthahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rate increases between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As administrative manager Herbert Schmidt showed up the panel, a new calculation of the fees for the waste water facilities of the market town was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or underscores will be compensated from the previous calendar period.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt founded the engraving rate for fees with the fact that in all three wastewater facilities there were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water fall, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters a year.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of the low distribution basis, for example expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">As a result of their age rehabilitation and repair expenditure, the calculations were not least due to a substantial scale in all three systems.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for the world meal, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt showed that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage in the wastewater system Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping mill Welschahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be recovered from scratch and after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage sludge had to be cleared out, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water regulations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "for these extraordinary expenses, the continued support and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period, came into consideration."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still considerably below the current level of the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of a low waste water fall in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance "were fully smashed."</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition to this, Schmidt, the market town of great entertainment costs for the sewage plant in the past 20 years, was spared.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the aforementioned facilities will remain precarious in view of stone houses in the long run, especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater association is not able to expand these facilities because it is a deficit unit.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is nonsensical to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure coming out of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unblooded, self-rotating tools generating more than 30 million selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All malfunctions reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapshots have drawn criticism in the past, where they were accused of promoting either black face or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week introduced a filter to some users, who gave them mortiers, false teeth and unsuspected cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowtail."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversy referred to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely spread over the photos, said that the filter was "vulnerable and emptied."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership distorting ISIS secret service information, establishes Committee of the Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command mean intelligence-related information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when the actual states would have allowed the site to report in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Committee, Intelligence Committee and the Army Commitee, reports from great discontent among Central Command Secret Service Providers who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, briefly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence official information, typically gendered by high-level Centcom Commanders, regularly recorded a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than the actual states would have allowed and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services," quoted a newspaper article.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the Centcom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there are no direct indications that government spikes under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts exposed the pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts" "" "" "" "stated the report." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mosssuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, the second-largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command has changed intelligence reports to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after it was played to allow analysts to worry about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed findings as the investigations continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are under way by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom has created a moderately restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," stated the highest-level Democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement known.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this process," "" "" "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "" "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated no evidence of a White House intervention in the Centcom analysts regarding a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector who was taken up for complaints by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector are still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have diverging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful aerial campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, last year accusations have raised the question that President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush looked at only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Mr. Hooker's team stated that, contrary to government declarations, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the Legislative for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel permanent and inescapable, a rapid relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick, which is handed down from the wristguard to the swimmer to the gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's chat in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Leverky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's flock with dimples, could have been among those familiar names that are sent to Prime Time, created by sponsors and well-being TV advertisements, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even frank.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, some in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistols, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would like to make arguments for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it was so sparsely perceived the last 16 years that many of those who had asked me did not know that it is a Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US sent athletes to compete, there has never been a medal in the trampoline jumping competition and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider character, partly because it sounds more fitting for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a given enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonical trembling of its never-ending bounce - but also the grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "the word" "" "" "" "Trampoline" "" "" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means" jumping board "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="22">Up-and-coming victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling motions (turning, hatching and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympiaprogram you will be judged according to design, difficulty and flight time.</seg>
<seg id="24">Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must go further in their quest to gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and back, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the output wall, but also another highlight in television broadcast: the world or the Olympic host.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel fatigued while watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of this, the trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless as an astronaut, goes upwards, then downward, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time, the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will exude the final round as part of a afternoon bloc on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the angularity and the objective tightening of male athletes - as the male U.S. gymnasts have recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>

<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads tend to be quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the suppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted whereby dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the vastings of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have other options except protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.</seg>

<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are worried that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, exploit the turbulence and can arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why, after years of bitterness, feelings of bitterness under the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies who hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young ethiopians stated that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amhas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons of eons, the Amharas, which come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian high countries, prospered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are under a screen to coordinate," "" "" "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amhas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was in Ethiopia's prime minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special mandates to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "" "", "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unclear reasons in order to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil in 2005 after thousands were protesting against elections, which, according to information by analysts, were apparently fucked by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the raids that followed, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the past few months and this time of turmoil went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and their measurable progress in combating poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But evidently this has not prevented the intensification of the internal abnormality of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an aminous town, managed by Tigray, and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more usual in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The US government used Ethiopia as the basis for DronenTours to neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his assertion Obama had founded ISIS "Sarkasmus"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy on Friday which resumed his campaign by attacking that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were not meant seriously by the "Founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification gave rise to new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and coherently with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings together his fellow combatants who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of declaring statements that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump resigned in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not want to point out that the president and Mrs. Clinton have created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet Mr Trump stated that he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day, where Mr. Trump stated in a number of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct his campaign's focus on the economic situation due to declining demand.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking to Michigan's economic situation this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he raised strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clintons's emails, but later he said "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to rowing back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more corrosive tone as his survey values have gone further." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leading lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries to apologize for his provocative statements, he frequently blames his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing on attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trunk's jokes have brought his loyal co-workers to the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent leaders of Trump, gave his candidate a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" "" "" "" "Mr. Giuliani said he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, Clinton's Secretary of State served as the Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to expand by taking control of the situation in the Middle East aggressively.</seg>

<seg id="8">A revived club Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north from its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing staff of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a client offered to provide money for a new outside table, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps of the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnish as capers and sautéed onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural tears.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said that he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Williamsburg," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a client.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg before and regularly visited the verb.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb closed, she gave up the coffee tines for a while, she said.</seg>

<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been a long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went to work there, and inevitably always ordered the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I came to a quarter to seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything Bagel with butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said he had no anger about the fact that the hop business took the old business space.</seg>

<seg id="40">The location also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee in the bottle.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favourites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and the burial felt a new coffee like a homecoming.</seg>

<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the central point of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures were tried out, because a calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even wholesome cuisine.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an investigation, this shark was allowed to return to the sea aboard the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks only get offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland shark swims at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal reaches a deep 2,6 km / h - and with this top speed it is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle, characterized by loneliness, seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" in any case from a Grönland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland sharks become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her slow-motion pentagraphs measured six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt dormant animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice sea and seek cadavers torpedating from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland sharks, who brought fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the greatest 502 meters measure.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens nucleus of sharks using the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly high carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s as nuclear weapons search for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimetres, the lens nucleus contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, which is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the lens nucleus all larger Greenland-sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts, that result from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 watch for a 493 centimeter long Greenland hai showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres was even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">The researchers were now able to assign an age to the researchers.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably on the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-sharks with the multiplication obviously have at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates presently.</seg>
<seg id="33">The fact that such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland wal, in whose bacon on the neck stuck a 120-year-old harpoon point, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs into flame-flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal leaves heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than in one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as soon as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from walking in inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipowder.</seg>
<seg id="3">The method proved to be effective and the HoneyGuide Foundation, which had already had the idea for years, has strengthened its promotion along with the U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in Northern Tanzania, to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without hurting animals.</seg>
<seg id="4">Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friday is the Day of the Day dedicated to the Protection of Animals.</seg>
<seg id="6">"since we have developed the... Toolkit, we were able to observe a change in attitude within these communities, although they are more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant," said the Managing Director of HoneyGuide Damian Bell in a message.</seg>
<seg id="7">The first two steps include the illuminating of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles into a horn.</seg>
<seg id="8">If it is not deterred, a so-called "Chiliwolke" is thrown.</seg>
<seg id="9">Chilipowder mixed with earth is packed together with a firework body into a condom, whose end is turned to the ignition switch.</seg>
<seg id="10">When it is lit, the condom clumps up with a knob and sprays fine dust at chilipowder in the air.</seg>
<seg id="11">A touch is usually already sufficient to chase the elephant.</seg>
<seg id="12">One last possibility is a thrower that shoots a gold firework in the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit of the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were handled.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next romanian journey of all the ministries in the foreseeable two years, the Chief of the Ministers of the Secession of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimages were being tested and one decided finally for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where this year, during the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrim's destination was offered at the opening of the Holy Year of Mercy.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, and Gotol, and Haigerloch, and the rooms of the saints, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, pastor Storost sent pilgrims in a small ceremony at St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims and shared the pilgrim's blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb he was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Muenster of Our Lady stood and so the pilgrimage was started from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impetus with various prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis played on field crossings, chapels or churches every time to sing together a song from specially arranged pilgrim songs.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the nights, the parishes of the local parishes were available.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stages Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller supplied a tasty as well as starchy evening meal and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">After that, one stepped on stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, but had to descend at an altitude of about 500 metres in high heat and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a barbeque on the bathing pond in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning pulse on the 4th pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, it went to Freiburg on the closing stage.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Minis was visibly relieved and happy later in the afternoon at the Freiburg Muenster and went through the door of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse God was thanked here.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert was welcomed at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day there was still time for the Breisgaumetropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the Men's Sprint in Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British Team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow embarked on the anchorage that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after taking a modest sixth place, despite the withdrawal of Hoys in March, despite the withdrawal of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as Hindes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in which they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner were competing in the qualifying rounds, but the New Zealanders won the first round in the standard rounds.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes dropped slightly after his lap, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hindu drove in a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and to make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic team in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he fell on track after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no appeal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "It feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune like London." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We did so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is possible to repeatedly win Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for the British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - an output of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same to Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "" "" "I only enjoy this for the moment." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="36">"" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be routed to the knight." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the Four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record that won Gold in 2012 was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he had argued with officials before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the appropriate women's competition, which will be continued and completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team is relying on its strong train bike team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a host of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations were shut down for Rio.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background, with the resignation of Shane Sutton technical director in April in the middle of Sexismus- und Mobbingvorkapfen as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks quite like the legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A 20-year subsidy expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workplaces in the installation of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs -direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to dominoes, since the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa included the Point Henry Melt, which led to closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar, and last due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp. keep smaller shares.</seg>

<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written the value of contracts in its annual closing in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa declared that the decision to book the contracts, the "Alcoas" ability to operate the melt or to ensure the electricity supply to the melt "did not impair.</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into effect from November this year, even if there is still an explanation why it withdrew from the contract.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans, Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran to the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this verse made me cry," "" "" "" "Kendall wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians something similar?), sphered reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (except for Rob and Caitlyn, and in the presence of the most popular show biz-uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest): they all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the cliché action of almost every birthday party of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartooness on a TV station at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians began with certainty.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim likes it, as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most popular edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that rather resembles an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the issue draws a large number of advertisers (According Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the roller 615 pp. advertisement).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were still appearing before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years there were definitely more "celebrities," modeled as "models that are celebrities" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and brand ambassador, Jennifer Lawrence, was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the little chance that Ms. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of its generation - falls under the previous category, it is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if it applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners's success doesn't like everybody.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality TV story, Jenners was always a little tense in the world of fashion.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized them and called them "the mistletoes of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were high again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have recorded similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet turned slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to host life and protected from fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus showcases its day-side of the Sun for almost two months," said scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that cooler a few degrees than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, which is similar to evolution previously thought by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was supposedly inhabitable, Venus -- in the course of several billions years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was burnt out of ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide came back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of rotational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers understand why stars rotates in the star cluster to different rates, and in which context the rotational periods are related to planetary formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star cluster, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades is located 445 light-years from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">To top rotational rates, these ripening stars excel large amounts of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the stars of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is aged, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star, recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars are more slowly turning slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, whereby bigger stars turn slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the star cluster of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older ones," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is still a lot ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how the how, when and why stars slow down their rotational marriages and so to speak their "dancing shoes."</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and her colleagues reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotational rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="2">The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in the best days from Base to Base.</seg>
<seg id="3">After his emotional withdrawal announcement, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on 12 August against the Tampa Bay Rays.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I say goodbye," explained the 14-time all-star game participants of the Major League Baseball (MLB).</seg>
<seg id="6">Three times Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.</seg>
<seg id="7">His signature under a ten-year contract has given him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.</seg>
<seg id="9">As a player, Rodriguez paid back for a long time with performance.</seg>
<seg id="10">With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he made some milestones.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two additional baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the 41 year old should not be included in the baseball's hall of fame.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was in the field so controversial its appearance outside the square.</seg>
<seg id="14">In 2009, the superstar was admitted to "ESPN," between 2001 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="15">In August 2013, he was blocked for 211 games due to involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rodriguez is considered the prime suspect to have received funding from an anti-aging clinic in South Florida for years.</seg>
<seg id="17">After a lawsuit, the lock was reduced to 162 meetings.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the league could have done a favour for 2014, as I played 20 years without a break," "" "" "" "Rodriguez said at that time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Also his farewell-days do not run noiselessly.</seg>
<seg id="20">While many baseball legends in their last games get the big stage, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.</seg>
<seg id="21">"my job does not include a farewell tour."</seg>
<seg id="22">"my job entails trying to win any game," etched Yankees coach Joe Girardi.</seg>
<seg id="23">After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and the relations with Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson said, sympathy and sympathy of fans of Yankee-Erzrivale Boston red Sox.</seg>
<seg id="24">"we want A-Rod," the supporters of the 4: 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.</seg>

<seg id="2">Wipes: because of a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland may not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping casualties.</seg>
<seg id="4">An athletic athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping attacks have become known for the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter-obstacle course in Silvia Danoviwa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately prior to the start of the already critical athletics competitions these news came to the fore.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide diuretic has been demonstrated last Sunday that is used as a masked agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old had reserved the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, just around 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>

<seg id="12">The national association took the matter "very seriously and demands fruitful cooperation with the investigations," quoted Xinhua from a message: "we will work together with the International Sport Court in CAS and will accept the verdict."</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news about the positive test at Danekowa passed, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," said the Bulgarian TV channel BNT.</seg>

<seg id="17">According to the report, the bidoping agent EPO should act in the forbidden substance.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danoviwa has been suspended provisionally, according to BNT, the B-specimen should have already been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately contacted the athlete with criticism.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't understand why the sportsmen don't draw the right conclusions," "" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="24">Before the start of the athletes, especially the case Danoviwa is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Federation IAAF had prohibited the entire Russian squad to an exception because of systematic doping, also the nation of Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data claw: hackers blackmail their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by the malware Abwehr specialists, Malwarebytes of 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, sometimes several times victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany nearly 20 per cent of the companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims were willing to use the solutions required by the offenders to reuse the systems and data challenged.</seg>
<seg id="6">The offenders specialize their blackmail software according to the observations by Malwarebytes in particular on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially high-resolution ransom will be considerably higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a startling fast evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes leader Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the Malwareutilities were still designed to send advertisements.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks resulted in a startling fast in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware uses a simple pattern: once active on the computer of an victim, it searches for recently changed files, such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as for archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users are using the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without the production still being shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Correspondingly higher the damage is caused by a ransomware.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 per cent even had to interrupt their business activities, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks which may be threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we always say to the victims" "" "" "" "does not pay, you only support the problem," "" "" "" "explains Kleczynski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the wake of standstill in operation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with blackmail and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a type of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set free accessible support sites, or decrypt for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private persons are released after payment of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit amounts in order to retrieve their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potential high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more and more professional and share their work, explains Security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within one week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more probable that it is three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular box to the actual blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware kit so far originated by buying malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price of $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers are looking for further hackers to spread the purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set from a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per computerised computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals employ spammers with the spread," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known for many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust that ransomware can be averted by file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful shooting, the offenders face the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "" "" "explains Malwarebytes leader Marcin Kleczynski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus, the potential for damage depends on the type of data to be much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators will also be able to take completely new targets on the net of things in the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz Defcon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get under their control a thermostat connected with the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the release of such blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V looks rather small, the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it does not work in any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well finished and pleasant, only the upper side of the cockpit is a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is not only a luggage compartment of 453 l with high-quality and 1026 l with reversed back rests, but there is the Magic Seats.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like a nettle and thus offer storage space, which is high from the ground up to ceiling 1,24 m.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot can be loaded easily, but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates HR-V with torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is likely to do a bit quieter for his job.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "driving is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="19">The security systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (operates to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warner sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote assistant is very reliable.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI-jack are underneath the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines meet the Euro 6 emission standard.</seg>

<seg id="2">It regularly takes a look at the bypass road - here's a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But that is to change: the right-to-right balance should be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic on the ambient street every night in traffic jams if they drive via the motorway (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">The road construction will be extended on Tuesday and Wednesday (16-17 August) in the area between Hammer Road and exit Weseler Straße at 700 meters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then cycle directly from the Hammer Road to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The major advantage: the traffic is sharing early on, whereby the overall process is improved on the busy section of the federal road 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representing Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The train ride on the feeder gets nervous the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays the back-traffic reaches the bridge over the Albersloh way and sometimes beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason for this is the needle eye on B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here, traffic is only lowered single-lane over the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be built back more than three quarters of years ago.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around eternally, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep well before the wake-up ringing.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep problems or sleep disturbances manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there can be many causes to them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeks, member of the board of the German Society of Sleeping and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one inevitably understands, however, is the Insomnia, that is, a sleep-in and through-sleep disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially the sleeping feel many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German House physician association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">This can lead to organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, sleeping disorder is an expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is especially frequent in depression," says Weeks.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors oppress each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Anyone who has a disk failure, for example, can lie badly, woke up every two to three hours, and possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disturbances become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor, says Weeks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look very different: one is tired, tired, unrested, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or even medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is barely concealed sleep mediator in Germany, says Professor Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleeping Medicine Centre at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, when sleeping problems, one should first turn to the primary doctor, says Weber.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should come to sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examining in the sleep laboratory, doctors, for example, advise in snoring with respiratory stimulators, in case of sick day fatigue, in sleeping transducers, or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is actually not necessary to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "" "" "says Fietze." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cabling you go to bed at the normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera draws the sleeping bag on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few screws on which one can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weaving counts: regular sleeping and sleeping hours, not too long in bed, don't sleep on the day, don't watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and don't watch out at night at night - then you start to count at once, and that is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimmers Markus Deibler has expressed himself on Facebook to disappoint the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014 he made gold for the first time at the short track championships in Doha and at the same time set up his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has released himself in front of his ex-team mates who stood in the critique.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 Euros and a jungle King 150,000 €no one should be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page during the night.</seg>
<seg id="6">The transport system in the swimming sport is bad, the doping controls, on the other hand, are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see or even operate doping so closely.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't say that controls should be set here," "" "" "" "he continued." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler would have to be registered for nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">That's exactly how you should keep it with countries.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some lime trees, in between still a rest cobblestone pavement: the Rīga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem so at first sight, but the police counts it to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one walks along the road from the east to the west, one passes at playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly!" sprayed on the facade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which is also soon to be demolished, it is already built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be created here.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trendy district," as the responsible real estate agency Friedrichshain calls, are however preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the inhabitants have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin Innensenator Henkel has expressed itself several times for a hard action of the police against the project, the area called "no-go-zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the police patrol the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadet forge, with 300 police officers, the police patrowed three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 police officers and three crew members on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers were commissioned by the unknown owner to the premises.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew from the jubilation of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street looks peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who trains three children here, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house-projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, which mostly wanted police protection against vandalous leftists.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin internal organizer and the police make up between occupants and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "quarter, which today also has a low average income in comparison to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">House occupied and the resulting residential projects have long been part of the neighborhood: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Main Street very close to Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been evacuated under high police regulations in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world in recent years: residents of East Germany and former home occupiers share their neighbourhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on the discarded disks or freshly painted facades, which were discarded with paint-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "no other street was mentioned this year as often as" "" "" "" "Leftist violence" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury are according to statistics almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences make property damage, which tend to meet the newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94, there can be no question of insecurity.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for acts of violence, it is weighty: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they are certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer region any longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect her street is not a criminal "focal point," on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately drawn into the Riga-Strasse - and has remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was so important for her to get back to her streets: from the police, the politics and the media, all of a sudden the interpretation of the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer the road continues to be taken away: by faceless new buildings in former mosquitoes that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these are ultimately condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well affected are living here," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I absolutely cannot approve violence and destruction." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should we do if someone never stops?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those trailed by color-bombs. the house-projects and the left-scene belonged to the neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come from should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub area, who can't complain about noise.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of management around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees himself as a contact person for all players: refugees, refugee aid workers, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the insulting Wollmilchsau, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - less mocking but rather focused on the multitude of desired areas of task - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-term experience in the field of social work, just an urgent Wollsmsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent place for three years limited.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was high time," "" "" "" "says Regine's customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers stand in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">You will have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The municipalities themselves must bear the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility shifts from the administrative office to the municipality and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it doesn't work, so it is necessary to rely on private flats, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, community apartments need to be redesigned as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are set up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a solid lead, there are internship placements, training places, schooling, one-Euro-jobs and remedial activities for refugees and migrants who have to be grounded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is not employment therapy. "</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity doesn't just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, says Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need special offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here, too, administration and volunteers are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain to the refugees that it takes a long time and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Anyone who will develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach can't work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "but there are problems," "" "" "" "people with whom nothing works" "" "" "". "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "" "" "all this is already a" "" "" "" "mammoth task." "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: are the two following the latest events fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine Customer clearly, "what some naïve name might be." however, a residual risk could and would not exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are sensitized already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins would call them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with that," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary members must look for activities on the spot and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that soon a new push to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics is afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">Currently there are around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
