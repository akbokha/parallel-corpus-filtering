Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about T@@ eher@@ an dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meeting , however , it should also go to the conflict with Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ states solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been curious for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu lack of will in the peace process .
due to the deal of the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continued to deteri@@ or@@ ate .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech before the US Congress , which was part of an affair against Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the forth@@ coming election in Israel .
in a emergency call Professor , shot his girl@@ friend
in a emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb with a somewhat tender voice of the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family contact of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
within the house , the officials found the bodies of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written not@@ iz , which was sc@@ oring onto a white block , I loved it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this stood according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb built in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , where he had already shot 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot at the door to his office and killed him .
Delta State University Poli@@ sig@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Lamb has made the promised emergency call at some point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police took him .
a day after shooting in the university , students and lectur@@ ers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motiv@@ ates .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state published details , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to record a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said that they were happy with his teaching .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he didn &apos;t have history of violence or a criminal history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a written book in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both signed in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose apprenti@@ ces comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time , there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb praised , he seemed too little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something is wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that he told him that he had told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
in this year , he built only two online courses .
the latest changes in the employment policy of the University is significant that the promotion , for the Lamb had worked so hard for him , no guarantee for an automatic path to a position as a Assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he knows nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are questions that cannot answer Lamb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trail when he drove back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he was arrested , with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house , about a mile south of his parent house at the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car was still in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and under@@ developed ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in ped@@ agog@@ y in the spring of education .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs recorded him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met with common friends .
she and her friends were in the High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach the guitar game .
he was at the time of the Women &apos;s Black m .
all the girls were mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the back@@ stone house that is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were killed 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter that was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een over his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een , he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up both on a summer @-@ year market .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night September 5th for the last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and mou@@ th@@ harmon@@ ic pi@@ el .
there was no sign that anything did not .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were on the premises and sh@@ attered each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of sciss@@ ors .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous people and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , a English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
at the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and took about 900 people , including lectur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the church at a candle light commemor@@ ative ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the M@@ ahn@@ wache , while the Univers@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be recorded on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is above .
this is a day of healing .

Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to contradi@@ ct that the police had shot the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb had been shot in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two ever married .

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theater next to me , and it will gradually be clear that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for a forth@@ coming documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ Moon says his response to Russia strengthened military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of continuous conflict , and more weapons are affected by violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN boss again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integ@@ rative negotiations for finding a political solution .
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the Foreign Minister of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the orders in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this situation is un@@ sol@@ uble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ban demanded five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which they have proved to achieve a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 surveys that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper edges when asking , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit area , and some begin to ask seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the rep@@ ubli@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys guided tour to the rising Her@@ man Cain , not only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise tr@@ umps and begin to flow their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current surveys that suggest that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
tr@@ umps Pop@@ ular values have been rot@@ ated by 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa has noticed that 60 percent of rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P vot@@ ers GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump is nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent which say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers say that they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ ying &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , the candidate would be .
a majority of Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans sees Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and bel@@ lied statements , 52 percent of the Republi@@ can vot@@ ers believe that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first preliminary state of the nation , the state of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent that he did not have the personality to execute effectively his office , and almost six of 10 ounce say that his temper@@ ament does not go into the White House , so ABC / Post .
rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers get accustomed to the idea .
if they set up their joints , rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers hold Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the last week four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten end of July took their money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle four of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , there is a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers Tr@@ umps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes almost every one .
some experts suggest that the shred@@ ded field probably contributes to tr@@ umps leadership while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed over a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head races between Tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump the multiple support .
before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points in front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ herself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say that they have formed their opinion .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the vot@@ ers who support Tr@@ ump say they have for@@ given their voices .
of course it can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never to change the opinion .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is the strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their opinion , are twice as frequent for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign against two months of immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; was the immigration and fishing point in the public discourse on 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump decisive His@@ p@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damage the new @-@ oriented efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post survey , six of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as the immigration remains in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do .
fru@@ stration on the government climb@@ s on new highest levels .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , half of the support of rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers , especially by their out@@ sider status .
six of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new assembly survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in Io@@ wa shows that three of four Io@@ wa rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ strated about the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive residential areas of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg , the most expensive residential community - overlooking the North Sea .
in the road a square meter of a re@@ hom@@ eless building costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects are naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means it is in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows where special layers cost a square meter most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residence , one of the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a leader@@ board of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in sw@@ inging heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro to nothing - per square meters , well known .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not far from the top here .
champ@@ ions League : Bavaria @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ f@@ acher Tor@@ shake in Pira@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a happy showing of Thomas Müller took the way to a earned 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pira@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign opening of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Göt@@ zes Results ( 8@@ 9 ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth success in series is to be the first step towards the finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to pick up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received his 28 hits in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s leadership in the Bavaria leadership of the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who left one as a flan@@ k of the World Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without shine .
Pira@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the Royal Class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 proud here Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , in seven European teams with Greek teams did not want to be the next sacrifice .
they went courage@@ ous , but often in their open efforts , but often too .
the attacks were often used by playing at the left side of Douglas Costa , who was rarely passed against the former Yugosla@@ v O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck of right than his flange made out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ th minute , the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first , as a Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown the head ball of Poland struck by the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct withdrawal , the Tor@@ wart Roberto is par@@ ked with the knee ( 35@@ th ) .
although the Bavaria were accustomed to dominate the dominant game , Pira@@ eus was able to sit down .
but on Tor@@ hil@@ ter Manuel New was off@@ ence .
as he had a shot of ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te steering ( 5@@ 6. ) .
with David Al@@ aba , Guardi@@ ola left a four chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ ader , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the open Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller still sat one .
in front of the game it was come to Kra@@ w@@ allen &apos;s stadium .
after a smaller group of some m@@ um@@ med Bavaria fans in their audience blo@@ c , the followers of hosts Pira@@ eus had been prov@@ oked with words and gest@@ ures , attacks the security forces and went with stro@@ kes against the Munich pendant .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this puts a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study .
the good news : at Ver@@ zi@@ cht , the risk decreases quickly .
smo@@ kers have significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this goes out of the long @-@ term study of an international team of research , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ F@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers lay the risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2,5@@ - to 3.6 feet higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes for tooth loss may be c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for this peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss may therefore go back to frequent g@@ ums in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear that smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who heard with smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the haz@@ ard back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , the du@@ sty writer Thomas Dietrich declared from the English University of Birmingham .
one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , declared study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking short@@ ens the life time . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and leads to good dental health to high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population is affected by the age of 65 to 74 years of in@@ som@@ nia , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking will increase the risk of early teeth .

in the third construction section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards the archae@@ ologists were now fifth .
text documents have already been known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to the remain@@ der of the fortress and the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ ms , a cemetery with some 350 graves have been discovered that belonged to the church .
young woman from freight train
after a young woman at the train station in the goat @-@ wing lin@@ ders , the Federal Police asks the population to help people .
at the early Wednesday morning , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the railway station and was captured by a freight train which came from the direction of Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
due to the capture of the access , it was borne by the federal police of heavy injuries .
she was treated in a hospital on site and brought to a hospital in a hospital .
over the reason of the noc@@ tur@@ nal track crossing the young woman there are no findings in the Middle East .
the incident was possibly observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
there are residents or pass@@ ers of Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , brick @-@ pool , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .
indications that provide information about the cause of the accident , can be given by the public police under telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system on the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement T@@ TIP .
the controversial private lighting equipment for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system that corresponds to much more traditional dishes in its functional manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ din has to bring the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
by T@@ TIP , the largest free trade zone of the world is to arise with 800 million people .
the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings see that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new investment Tribunal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come to the same parts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time a second instance is planned .
it would allow it to rise against judg@@ ments .
so far , the process involved in the arbit@@ rators agreed on arbit@@ rators , a possibility against whose judg@@ ments did not exist .
in the discussion of recent months it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström .
in the long term , she wants to work according to an international investment court .
for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) is considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , about the company damages the tax@@ pay@@ ers to negotiate national laws or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organizations such as Camp@@ act did not act as inadequate as the proposals of the European Commission .
it has been critici@@ zed above all that it is not intended for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) signed the plans on the other hand as a major progress .
the Commission took part in the reform of significant points , the Federal Minister of Finance Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked in spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration was from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Business Association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the Free Trade Agreement T@@ TIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) will be completed on Wednesday .
the negotiations run since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investment protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
originally a framework for the agreement was already at the end of this year .
this date is considered no longer durable .

since then St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be wonderful creative Ir@@ rer .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister
since its election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut is expected in the questionn@@ aire of prime minister with tension
the new Labour chair@@ woman Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to give his debut at the ceremony of the prime minister and put himself to David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to the first of his six questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be checked by the media and the Labour MEPs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , because it comes after his appointment to a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech on the TU@@ C @-@ Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour chairman , on Tuesday during the singing of the national hy@@ m@@ ne at a commemor@@ ative celebration of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , cri@@ es criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands in the centre of several titles stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne , has taken attention to himself
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the air battle around England &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he told the Labour chairman to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne , &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called upon differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be stack@@ ed within Labour &quot; and in accordance with Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements to the European Union and limitation .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes to remove all the idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and police ministers said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23.@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour chair@@ woman , the David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory boss , over the last decade of the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the questionn@@ aire of the Prime Minister is to con@@ front and that he has under@@ gone both &quot; perc@@ ei@@ ty &quot; and the stri@@ fe with re@@ hook , and instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic ministers , is represented by him , if he does not participate - for example when Mr. Cameron is abroad abroad .
he also taught the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and he said John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the under@@ house , addressed to discuss the problem .
when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he is linked to the policy in style of a &quot; hom@@ le theatre &quot; that is often linked to the questionn@@ aire of the prime minister . but some years later he had to have failed in it .
since they were sent in television in 1990 , the questionn@@ aire was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the Ur@@ part of a leader and his leadership in the Unter@@ haus and its position under his parliamentary elections , although critics argue that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound went to data that show a rise in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel with the FT@@ SE 100 , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the goal of SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same year @-@ earlier period .
this percentage has been the fastest and generated assessments over the time of a interest rate .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was raised up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to EUR 1,@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the Riv@@ alen AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and bring brands like Bud@@ wis@@ s , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were in encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts will propose all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry and again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boss of JD Sports says that higher wages are dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Managing Director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the bags of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power would be the higher labour costs in his company , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs could be the expansion plans of JD Sports , added and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese to potato d@@ öner idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
it goes both - and in the potato bass driver , which has developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
inspired by the &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
the idea brought him a poster at a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the wording &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had seen random@@ ly in television .
since then , in his shop a barbecue sp@@ ears , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is multic@@ ultural for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has changed the Leban@@ ese in the meantime at the patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has been protected as a utility model according to the authority .
as much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ e@@ wer contains , Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y Al@@ hay .
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds .
also with its customers the culinary international understanding come well .
Met@@ cash launches ground @-@ duty campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - Immig@@ ration
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of a Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
in order to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
during Al@@ di , the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia have prepared their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream media and marketing on social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA shops and shop owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash releases further details of his defence strategy on 29 September , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices leads to its annual investors strategy .
there is much on the game because South Australia and Western Australia are almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ically provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to approximately 14 percent in Eastern states .
however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di will take some five percent of the food market in these two states and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to the report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley , that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million revenue per year and Met@@ cash 250 million to the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di is opened in the next year 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and generate a turnover of 500 million $ and 600 million dollars in each market .
the loss in food and food business and the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed costs could cost Met@@ cash around 13 million $ gain before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in Eastern states , mainly on Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley accepts that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 to increase 4.@@ 1 percent in 2017 and 2.@@ 1 percent in 2018 and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business meeting in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to respond publicly to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week has taken contact .
since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS market share has declined by 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which is about 1,@@ 200 percent in 2012 , which reflects the operating debt reduction in sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler we@@ eds and invested more than 150 million $ to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths with hundreds of products each week to improve their shops through faster growing fresh foods and deliver a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that prices and shop san@@ itation programs will be set to Elan and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in 2017 .

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves the view of the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly more praise than criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always called &quot; Special Ks &quot; was caused by the not@@ orious confron@@ tation of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka with the Montreal Masters into the spot@@ light .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ rators , where Har@@ rison had called , &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Cy@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a Kra@@ mp@@ f failed a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup half @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I &apos;m pretty busy , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was a little in the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost a ra@@ cket in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat from Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has in the US Open extremely well , even among the pretty prov@@ ok@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard , and he has never been a problem with the other players , he is working hard , it is good in form , he is a very stable and sophisticated young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Cy@@ gios at the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as long @-@ term solid part to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not on all the contro@@ vers@@ ed around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick was very quickly informed about what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he asc@@ ends in the eyes of the public , but we try to support him , but we try to understand him the consequences of his actions . some time outside the ra@@ mp where he can only think about it , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains not@@ with@@ standing , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the not@@ with@@ standing and ri@@ pen@@ ed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the firm who tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the goal to stop the current of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted with indig@@ nation .
the people who fled before violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but fru@@ strations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter over them , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some reported from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ens Foreign Minister declared , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would return from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came to a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a strong meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were transferred to Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be achieved that the EU states would have further 1@@ 20.000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
however , Hungary did not put his hopes on an immediate action of Brussels or from his neighbours .
in two southern regions , authorities in two southern regions reported more powers to tackle the crisis , so that they could accelerate roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country is also planning a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the current of migrants through the country - after having finished a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison interest in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in recent months , Hungary has become a considerable bott@@ len@@ eck in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and has become a significant increase in the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic volati@@ lity are based on the search for a better life , and not prisoners who claim to protect themselves - a view that is strongly in contradiction to other EU states , among them Germany .
the new laws , which stood at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) tall Za@@ uns to build the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime .
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the emergency state , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military service , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orter of Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come up by damage the fence , they are now accused of police force and are accused of being accused of crimes according to the new laws .
the authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials joined two of the seven border transi@@ tions with Serbia after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surro@@ unds the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and pressed a crowd to push down there .
about 20 did it to come to come , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are travelling to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clin@@ t &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former US Foreign Minister H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit leap in the democratic race to nom@@ inate the nom@@ ination on national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who hasn &apos;t announced whether he is responsible for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the pre @-@ elections , most democratic vot@@ ers say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined that candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ tons supports supporters in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News @-@ Survey Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders generated some gains .
Clinton holds a great advantage in women and mix@@ es , but these projections have decreased .
your support in men is significantly reduced , and S@@ anders are only back with 5 points .
Clin@@ t &apos;s advantage of democratic vot@@ ers under 50 years has fled , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same height .
however Clinton still has a great advantage for older vot@@ ers .
last month Clinton was before S@@ anders with two dig@@ its in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pre @-@ elections say that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some precau@@ tions and more 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ t &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while 48 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their nick@@ andi@@ st Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ t supports supporters in an open question , why they want them to be the candidate , is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time to be a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clin@@ tons supports also their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval for dealing with problems and vot@@ ability are also c@@ ited .
since the Vice President thro@@ ws a potential for the pres@@ idency of the Wa@@ ag@@ shell , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pre @-@ elections see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic vot@@ ers are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , is Bi@@ den at the top .
Clin@@ t &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be the second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if bi@@ ds do not decide for the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clin@@ tons will increase in front of S@@ anders , 20 points with bi@@ ds in race on 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of the democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the choice ; however , this number of 78 percent decreased in the last month .
bi@@ ds is a second at this measurement , but the percentage of which he sees him as the &quot; sel@@ bar@@ est . &quot;
nevertheless , at the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call questions about vot@@ ability .
similar to the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this vot@@ ers are not acceptable for these vot@@ ers .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics in vot@@ ers of the elections of their party .
gener@@ als consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts the three candidates best at hon@@ esty while Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of the democratic vot@@ ers do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
democratic vot@@ ers of the pre @-@ elections in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , approximately one quarter of the democratic vot@@ ers do not think of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clin@@ tons are used to use a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as a foreign minister , most Democratic vot@@ ers are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of Americans is un@@ happy with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her still deteri@@ or@@ ated .
it mainly rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the vot@@ ers of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered vot@@ ers : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the voting rights also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good notes at leadership .
from the six tested candidates cut Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best at hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ anders more than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many do not think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves close to Donald Tr@@ ump near nation@@ wide .
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times close to Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the vot@@ ers ent@@ ails in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers support nation@@ wide still Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted by Fox News debate last month , around 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son sch@@ oss in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also showed that Car@@ son arrives well in demographic groups and sur@@ passes tr@@ ump under rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ therine , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is at the lowest rate , and of 10 % support last month at now 2 % .
the former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located 6 % on the third place .
the error mar@@ ge at the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son asc@@ ends in the surveys - it lan@@ ts 19 % support for rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view of one in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some sides for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question tr@@ umps faith in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign appearances in Io@@ wa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bath temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , it is enough to find a trip to the Mediterranean in order to offer warm water .
a bathroom in North or Baltic is likely to be a short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people do not go to the sea : maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) shares .
on the other hand , the Mediterranean is still the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student during a schi@@ kan@@ ous ritual as a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ ank@@ ings are filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory issue in September 2013 , and delayed its transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police shared with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 at , after Den@@ g was killed and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s dress , to contact his symptoms to goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the National President of the Brotherhood to take counsel , said polic@@ eman Chris Wagner on a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the members began to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said polic@@ eman Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with st@@ ump@@ et@@ le force injury to head , hull and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the Sch@@ ik@@ anen , &quot; Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family , in a declaration .
breaking and their members must be drawn to account , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge for the first five members for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are charged with criminal attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has contradi@@ cted its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest
a interest rate comes , and the house will get into the wound , ren@@ di@@ fied for bonds , and the economy will gli@@ de in a recession .
we know that .
what we do not know how long it will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history for the economy is only a small guide to the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when lifting the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor of how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the US central bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when they begin to increase the interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , market participants could notice that the whole excitement was exagger@@ ated due to a interest increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at low level to cause sei@@ sm@@ ic shock that seem to fear many .
this does not mean that there is no effect .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the prevention of interest rates can be volati@@ le for a while .
once the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past 35 years , the market is mostly in the heat increase - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to the normal condition after 500 days , with an average return of 14.@@ 4 percent according to current analysis , Bob D@@ oll , Chef facility Str@@ ate@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the cycle cycle and the return will begin to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed was confronted with some conditions that could not exist before and that could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point at a interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , Deutsche Bank was only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent twice .
although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , only a few that this will continue and expect for the third quarter of the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
interest rates in such a question@@ able economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; whether it is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have made the whole year on an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could raise an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all increases cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists are very quickly placed after the beginning of recovery in the shadow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession was observed in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting for the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le since the market takes a interest increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle is done .
at the end of the hei@@ ghtening cycle , the bond was immediately falling , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to ren@@ di@@ tions between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a down@@ turn of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
it is interesting that Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation forecast , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the income curve is flat , lending have expanded and the volati@@ lity has risen - all features of the market if the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied its strategy .
in large and throughout , companies that will take advantage of the larger part of their business in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt are worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react very positively to three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 average of 5 percentage points exceeded .
companies with high capital yields as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ ants with low quality at average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will become a big problem .
companies with a high percentage of flexible interest will lose most of most , Gold@@ man said .
consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar outside of the pure stock of stock .
savings could see profits by higher income , even if experts are different , how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter because of its &quot; distortion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading parliamentary member and increases new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does not do something that does not do the private sender .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen said that the public @-@ legal radio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he went to the BBC Music Awards who started in the last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , The Br@@ its seem to be only under another name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontane@@ ously mentioned examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
what I do from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn more about classical music anywhere else .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the dedication of radio 3 , new music and to give new works in order , I really think it is important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he must work harder to get the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , while hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media , and sports under fire to enter the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins handle The Voice to - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for estimated costs of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall was that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judges - &quot; was produced on special BBC ways . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a hit from our own barn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to conclude the order of further rows of The Voice in the future or to give money to the pay@@ roll pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at the slo@@ west and the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased from three years ago by using mobile phones to buy seeds
experts believe that the Black Friday has slo@@ wed the expenditure in November .
for more than a decade , the virtual entry was dr@@ illed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have changed in spirit cities .
however , experts say that there are signs that the online sales are stag@@ nating after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared with the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales are stag@@ nating after new figures only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the years and up to 2000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ selling de@@ xes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained that online sales increased from three years ago when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile purchases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is , and we will possibly experience that growth decreases .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is quoted as a reason for subsequent sales .
experts believe that buyers will take their purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some merchants @-@ sites were going down .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyer could fight for bar@@ gain , buyers of which could stop purchases .
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that of 5 £ spending a bit more than 1 £ online .
with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now performed via web shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of men &apos;s clothing and shoes are bought online instead of fashion chains in the inner cities .

British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry

this leads to 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that aim to focus on tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q Sales represent nation@@ wide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you are sent to a hammer or a brush to avoid walls , you seem to be a minority today .
for Britain increasingly employ arti@@ sans to carry out DIY jobs in their houses , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who has the tree @-@ driven chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services to low prices is now over@@ hau@@ led .
for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are set to work on arti@@ sans and 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions are hit by women .
at the moment the men over@@ weigh the men .
she said it is necessary to represent the growing demographic trends that have more female single households who make more renovation than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to move this stronger to a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our customers from women with 80 percent of decisions about the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also changed its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial management .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher took a drop in half @-@ year profit and the surveys after the group was the cost of the closing of the shops .
because of the trends King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , 200 new branches will open .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of un@@ faithful before judgment
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball Vice @-@ Vice President A@@ ich / D@@ ob must be responsible for un@@ faithful and dep@@ ortation .
the accused were not guilty .
one of them was accused of mis@@ use .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the chief attorney Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ end@@ ants had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the pre @-@ examination that the def@@ end@@ ants were used in the years 2006 to 2011 Gel@@ der &apos;s accounts , which they were used in their functions , used for private purposes .
the damage caused by approximately 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ ens@@ en@@ ats , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence concluded that the association was not an asset in any time .
the sports work had only been charged and invested in the sports club for which they had been working from 1982 to 2011 , and invested in the debt of the debt - the liabilities in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( rd . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then we stood in front of the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we run the club further or lock we too ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused he decided to take this task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can manage the money freely , it may only be made for debt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of the financial - success , the pay@@ out of the compensation damage was decided until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the initial damage was only years later , namely from 2003 as a plus on the account has been paid .
for this reason , package and non @-@ detailed bookings seemed to be explained , the former Ob@@ man explained the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accounts and austerity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the second accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the pay@@ out of the association was not detailed , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the financial statements , it is important to have been the debt freedom , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , a total amount of 1@@ 20.000 Euros were transferred to the association account .
these were the def@@ end@@ ants , declared the def@@ end@@ ants .
this securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a long time , the respon@@ dents knew no answer .
then he finally said he had believed that this is the best for the association .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known anything from this money , the prosec@@ utor presented in the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , the functioning of the function@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why damages ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first def@@ end@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association has never been a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the function@@ ary said he never had a c@@ ents of salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
at Di@@ et , he made the association 1,000 euros per month , the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the def@@ end@@ ants .
these are according to an operating test , in which everything has been judged correctly , no longer declared , they declared .
mil@@ eage money had also been related to the second def@@ end@@ ants .
all Beh@@ eb@@ ungen are in cash , and he had to drive from his dwelling place of international international market to lead to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main trial will continue on September 23 , with the survey of witnesses .

it is a historical event because it has seven years since the F@@ ed interest in NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ sage , Lei@@ feld Staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is based on a relatively good performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb said the staff of the emergency call to send police officers to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is unlikely to interfere &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police asked the bond to his name , but he didn &apos;t have him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no explanation for his shots .
when the police took the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I am sorry I could reverse it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the not@@ iz Lamb 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he took E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday evening , when polic@@ emen killed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he knows nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there will be no information , no evidence for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said that she was married about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced from 15 years ago , but friends remained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help others , &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doc@@ torate in spring 2015 by the Delta State University , such as his life @-@ blue on the website of the university .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play Mon@@ el@@ ang because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven a double frac@@ ture of his right B@@ one .
while this is the left @-@ left outer defense , Louis van Ga@@ al won the hope to play Sha@@ w again in this season .
the injury was caused by a decl@@ ining attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 years old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the game field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg correction and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United comes , it is very difficult and then fantastic , and then this happens .
in the dressing room he had a oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red map and the suspension of a El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ rators had to worry about .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card was due .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
a book on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more again . &quot;
related to Manchester United States suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of PS@@ V
the United Kingdom def@@ enders has an additional incentive to recover until next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad violation . &quot;
if a player leaves the place of injury the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our player to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break , as Mexico against Van Ga@@ als Holland team played at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad violation , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction was so that it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad here . I &apos;m sorry for me .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a F@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unless you are David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book was asked to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I would like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or message we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron suppos@@ edly describes the action of the book , instead of adding a content of the film version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to expand the pretty short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the surrounding town of Th@@ anks @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , met her dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel was silent and the 1991 died , but completely unknown .
as if this was not susp@@ icious enough : the text of the Lor@@ ax film which is presented on the website of the Lor@@ ax film , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , is hoping to win a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is there to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is the action of the book so little familiar . here is a un@@ named boy , like the local environment by the gre@@ edy Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , schn@@ ur@@ red Bein@@ gs , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated .
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times a child .
a Down@@ ing Street Spe@@ aker said that the text had probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s election office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text by Cam@@ er@@ ons was delivered , but there was no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you have selected the K@@ ader , the England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not carry sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
the ball develops Mo@@ een Ali as Sp@@ in @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , an option for the attack .
please note : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the UK test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that critics are focused on results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said that - players are their own best choice .
long ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny .
if he is hoping for further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t work as good achievements , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question how much time a test stroke receives to put his sign is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
only comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ ward .
the only accus@@ ation that you can lift was that England first started Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer that I high .
he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket@@ Player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he met 236 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave Mo@@ een in addition to Cook , which would provide an extra @-@ sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , I thought , and I don &apos;t have anything .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed left has already shown that he is a devil @-@ sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een may not be done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no major difference .
my former team mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he entered in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he immediately managed and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s at an average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a Pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inn@@ ers who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a few clever supplements during the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ es , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece .
he is one of the most important guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experiences , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as players or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dressing room , even if the messages are in harmony with the previously singing .
Coll@@ ys team@@ mates at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part .
some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and team members do not determine the schedule .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you have to think about how players depend on their jobs from the results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Ex@@ hau@@ st of Britain from the EU ) could win on Zul@@ u when the economy is up to 2017 in a Fl@@ au@@ te unit
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ wi@@ ped new negoti@@ ating strategy to keep Britain in the EU , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ates Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ ats said that some member states , so deeply rooted in different crises , as the EU is now and not always of their own guilt , Britain himself created agenda with pal@@ p@@ ated conc@@ essions and interference changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it may not like the social protection of the social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Self@@ ie Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit meeting or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass is not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and can see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where there is no matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been left in power for 10 years before it looks bad for them , as it looks bad for them , like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
France François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or its creation in 2017 .
it is also a bl@@ ending force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they are going to break a leg in order to prevent the Self@@ ie @-@ British to prevent their energy from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ cal tendencies have .
for this reason , some such ministers may even have not seen helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend is suspected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how common the Fle@@ et Street can be on their costs and which EU scep@@ tics can be the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as it was inspired by Tony Ben@@ n inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , who supported our entrance 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 years .
with all his contemp@@ t , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
the Med@@ ley belonged to the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sh@@ ur@@ ks , telephone h@@ ack@@ ering foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners who possess most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you get better ban@@ anas in order to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans as Bla@@ ir himself , when he had refused Cam@@ er@@ ons referendum , for Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the not adopted Constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , who opened him a rear door .
the press has never lost him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on the back in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any time for me - seems in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ k@@ ott Mur@@ ten &apos;s strategy of 80 years to repeat , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position to Europe is - I think it is friendly - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar @-@ tendency and the wil@@ dest of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can be said to say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and television this week said , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 years , when his old father tried to be on television , to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet without losing too far and to lose its cab@@ inet@@ ts@@ job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow @-@ leaders and MPs after all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the touching Bot@@ tom @-@ Up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to communicate - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a brood @-@ area of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a self @-@ understanding as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite si@@ ege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left Dis@@ si@@ dents , which is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to NATO - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign to the exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have mis@@ str@@ au@@ tic vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this can be meaning@@ less ?
the United States are already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government at the power that I was reminded of something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was called .
experts critici@@ ze report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing public health of England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have provided the load capacity of the data en@@ quiries and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month grip the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptionally tiny foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the P@@ he &apos;s most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public is expected that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision @-@ making analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose CEO previously received British American Tob@@ acco Medium ( BAT ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BAT for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he should receive reports before the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for the selection of members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also specify a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco direction of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that on the asser@@ tions of BM@@ J already re@@ acts before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ kers dies at his addi@@ ction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e cigar@@ ettes compared to this are low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty of the information of the public about what the proof of proof and what does not , especially if there are so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die every year on a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion £ per year .
through the clear demonstration of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without any risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ calendar , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chair@@ woman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop programs such as East@@ calendar and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they will be public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen from a smaller audience to place in tough controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ is@@ sions like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success , with the BBC in contact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs have been commissioned or sent to be clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Johnson said the Ober@@ haus communications committee in the framework of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I do not want to keep the medium or long term , you should at least put his production at least on programs that do not make or put on behalf .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a wide support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it is ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ calendar is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm .
I would like to see how this is public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC blame on the hunt for reviews was &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the popular broad@@ casts of the BBC give again what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ calendar .
Johnson said that the rather public law programs &quot; to BB@@ C4 should go to BB@@ C4 , but they are able to argue that they can &apos;t measure their tasks , and they can argue when they are based on their apparent missions for the justification of 4 billion £ Radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ servers that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window where no one wanted to see her ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you think all that one receives a great value for 150 £ per year here , but for people who is a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , said that the BBC should review their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to inform and enter@@ tain them . &quot;
he said , only little of the BBC production would be officially classified as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and they should change in the public @-@ legal television stations in Australia and Canada .
the question of the partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broadcasting alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction in the moment where it is radi@@ ated with sound pulse .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by fl@@ ashing of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction in the moment when they have sound impul@@ ses that have a high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
the pul@@ ses work through the switch @-@ up of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to enable a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses into the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
F@@ aden@@ worms do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did so when they were surrounded by a fluid with microsc@@ opic air bub@@ bles .
the bladder , he found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penetrate the worms .
the reinforced ultrasound waves affect structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and be found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
the sound waves make the opening of this ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels bear .
when it turns ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro@@ bl@@ acks and transferred into the worms , where they turn off the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch neur@@ ons with impulses of light on and off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that must be sent to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asonic waves tissue can happen and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which are on bus stops and in subway trains and require a second glance .

in September there will be a s@@ warm of arms ste@@ ers with the DL@@ R ... customers are asked to assist in the stop of the arms trade fair .
the 300 posters are of artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum for cruel designs in Bank@@ sys Dis@@ mal@@ and .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped in the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ -@@ pack of in@@ bus@@ hings that claims &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet . &quot;

after G@@ avin Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lectur@@ er at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries .
many artists join activists within protest movements to work and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms posters greet the budget in the subway .
the Am@@ ne@@ sty video has been viewed over 100,000 times more than 100,000 times in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over @-@ artist who also works free of charge .
V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was aston@@ ished about the silence , which ruled around the advertising for the weapons fair - by a lease of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign to avoid them . &quot;
they played with the invention of a realistic tender company advertising , but &quot; through the pet@@ als with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they made a fantastic job by helping us to shar@@ pen awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices on the trade fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is an intru@@ sion of the British government and the guarantee that Fol@@ ders are not illegal in front of our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the arms show comes from the area within Excel where exhibitors have fantastic eu@@ ph@@ atic products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a press release , Sa@@ ab reveals an order of the US army on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the AT@@ 4@@ CS RS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student residence
eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the sm@@ iled smile of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the retreat in student dwell@@ ings ranges from slightly ner@@ ven@@ ous to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you are coming from where you are coming to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you do not love Mar@@ m@@ ite , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it &apos;s the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your las@@ hes would be in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave people .
the rooms of people often turn into beverage recipes , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract themselves and their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start at the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert received a gross treatment at the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many student dwell@@ ers form a space @-@ to @-@ room bo@@ mel culture that can lead friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you have to go away so that I have to return the energy I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ milit@@ ant is exhausted from your speed - and send him a SMS instead .
speaking pos : do you do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a non @-@ sealed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
since you start the Uni at the climax of back @-@ man@@ ia , the clo@@ ak on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now I smile if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mate feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and will be able to associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep sleeping when you ank@@ ind .
to steal food is a common crime in student dwell@@ ings .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chi@@ ckens is a theft , but is it a drop of a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to operate themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ es your stuff , it is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with more balanced than my room@@ mates who added their milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise , who keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the sphere to the people who are sitting in the glass house .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbors whether it makes them a little bit gentle , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even loud music .
when they stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they left their neighbours to sleep two hours before they left their own music , shut off their door and went to her three @-@ hour examination .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally go into the same student residence ?
vice versa it would not be very deep embarrass@@ ing if you hold a co @-@ mate for your future spouse , to separate themselves and see them every day , and perhaps to experience how they get all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to speak a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its key in his un@@ locked room , the border between a Ul@@ k and M@@ ob@@ bing is more fine than it seems .
a good thing is funny , but it takes only moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
share a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but don &apos;t miss one of the rooms with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys into a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but t@@ ack their pos@@ sessions at the ceiling no longer than twice .
semi @-@ detached houses for refugees , single @-@ pull @-@ out , Ger@@ ing@@ deser@@ ted
the real estate contractor Markus Gil@@ dner builds in the middle @-@ restricted Eck@@ ental town@@ houses for people who do not have a lot of money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the only attractive mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ earned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build even more and well today &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push on the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how swi@@ ft@@ ly favourable living space can be created : it builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push on the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay at a big part here .
in view of the refugee stream , we also need enough living space in the next few decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a semi @-@ detached house needs the least place .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different when people spend the people in residential blocks .
each of the six houses built straight in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square metres of living space per house is worth 184 000 euros , without land .
that is exagger@@ ated .
the construction lasts six months .
that is appropriate .
do the construction rules have been complicated by their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I used my project correctly .
especially complicated , it is always the dro@@ wning dam value of special construction and the parking space .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still subject to anyone who creates three apartments in a semi @-@ detached house , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities there is no place in the cities .
no cars and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their semi @-@ detached house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who have been accused of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not true .
but do not ti@@ ghten the competition for affordable apartments ?
Gil@@ dner : true : we had a construction boom in Germany for the last five years , but built in luxury apartments that can hardly afford a more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the only attractive mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ earned .
I show how you can still build and build up today .
this is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system if Apple Update is published
the new operating system can be requested by clicking on &quot; General , &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install Inst@@ all .
some have come to problems after installing problems , as they receive an error message that means that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to handle the problem , users are advised to wait either until the storm goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may possibly mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made it easier to do so when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it as soon as the process is completed .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is up@@ loaded during the update or is located near a charging device , so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may turn off on half way and could lead to a break of the updates .

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the Social Foundation and opened at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consult@@ ations , one can also participate in courses .
the social Foundation draws it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely in the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
there was recently a new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office recently opened .
here , right next to the shopping market , you will receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of health and nursing staff .
for years , we have been fixed with our out@@ patient care service , that often they can be used alone .
there are infinite number of questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consult@@ ations , the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherap@@ ist treatment .
the offers of the senior center and Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Eh@@ ep@@ aar Müller liked the idea to operate in As@@ endorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to know and accompany families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the garbage dump bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed the stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .

after the conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long @-@ term and stress EK@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
net income from a total of 500@@ 00 Euro will get the garbage dump within the scope of a funding programme from the local district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .

about 2000 patients come according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l every quarter in the field of Fel@@ ic@@ ausen , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another home practice practice .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steal in As@@ endorf .
if no followers were found , she would also have gone .
if you visit Müll@@ ers speaking lesson , the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the rim are still in familiar faces .
with their good@@ bye ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the medicine has been practi@@ sed for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ standing breaks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the long time she felt a little bit of sorrow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will often see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds la@@ stly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and travels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to how it is clear that everyone who wants to establish a asylum will also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and security of the people stand in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that it needs significant signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia ref@@ uses &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to travel to Austria and Germany in direction of Austria and Germany , and also to establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
however , this was the inner minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - mainly to Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strong .
as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants its borders for refugees but not to be abri@@ dged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried in the night @-@ hours to Tuesday , in Ost@@ croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles have constantly meet new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Sy@@ rer and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with around 4000 refugees , Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , led to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
however , the government in Belgrade suffered , however , that it is that people are wise to propose certain routes : &quot; neither can we do , nor do we want to do this . &quot;
according to the media reports , at least 50 refugees in the Serbian border town Si@@ d arrived , the course of the day would be expected further buses expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were the whole night from around 500 kilometres away from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made us , so the police said that we should go here &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
in this way , it could indeed be already predicted by observation of the previous Balkans route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatian Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphasized that his country for the fall of a strong immigration of refugees prepared appropriate plans for possible exclusion situations .
details did not call it , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member &quot; have comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
to qualify strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the space @-@ room .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have a good witness to the country since 2007 .
on ser@@ b@@ ish side behind the Hungarian border fence continues about 300 refugees .
according to Belgian media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wedn@@ es@@ days at a local sight in Hor@@ gos : he hold the debates about alternative routes from refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be able to act very high refugee numbers .
one could not say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
volunteers rates migrants to - dangerous - Alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee camps have already begun to distribute maps of maps on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian region , there is still not a large min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ers were sent in the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are captured in the end , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the S@@ EC message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes against 32 other accus@@ ations in the case lasted .
most of the def@@ end@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ er helped with this action on her 20 @-@ year anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we went with the action in the midst of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ er aid is also available for questions and conversations as well as the volunteers .
while man@@ ch moves spontane@@ ously to the chal@@ k and the set around &quot; my life be@@ j@@ ah@@ en , &quot; can read &quot; the war , &quot; or &quot; not long suffer , &quot; continue to read , say phrases like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go further .
always again , on the edge of small discussions about the action , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is just on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I am clear that for me at the end of this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic plant Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carriers of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ er .
this is why this public @-@ effective action is good for 20 @-@ year @-@ olds .
that doesn &apos;t everyone to tell anyone on the tables , however , be understandable , but finally , it is a very personal thing .
the theme of death and dying be hair@@ y according to tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , especially the hos@@ pi@@ ous movement in recent years have contributed much to the people to open .

the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in the next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous predi@@ ction .
anal@@ ysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
in spite of the price increases , the average amount of 4,@@ 9 percent will be effective and will be effective on 4 January and in spite of higher supplements for bo@@ ilers of heavy and large packages that will be raised from November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that it is expected to increase the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online trading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company produces &quot; solid income when the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than the rival U@@ PS announced that 9@@ 0,000 up to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research asked anal@@ ysts predicted .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks asked anal@@ ysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
Fed@@ Ex has posted a drop in international priority shipping , which brought revenues in its unit Express @-@ shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result was reduced due to higher labour costs in cargo business .
in pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares around 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , on 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
on their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ ag@@ oni table sitting in order to decide whether it is time for the first time for almost a decade .
dro@@ pping over them at an end of the twi@@ sted , two @-@ storey seating area is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from the Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices are stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ ri@@ dden third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to escape from the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ ods in the global financial markets have been anxi@@ ous to strengthen these volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is just about a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief economic in the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text , the interest rate was not increased , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do what to do with the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who recently asked Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a interest rate this week .
however , the financial markets expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance to increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed has increased the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists increase the blow by making it promise that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value for 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or around 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the set in this week , John Lon@@ ski said , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at this point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far to calm the financial markets so that they do not get into panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argue that a interest of interest would be cal@@ ming the financial markets because they are the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
even before a month the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set of 0.25 percentage points in this month , the first little step in a slow mer@@ ging of monetary conditions that would test the strength of rest in the United States .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , that in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence expected .
although the creation of jobs in August slo@@ wed down , the improvement on the labour market was solid .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of a recovery .
and although inflation constantly went under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Repres@@ entative said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world looked at the end of the last month after China had deduc@@ ted his currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value fell in May by more than 16 % under its highest level as investors feared that a slo@@ wing of the Chinese economy would be the global growth .
the market has taken something in this month , where the D@@ ow is now around 10 % below the h@@ och of May .
for the F@@ ed Repres@@ entative the market turbul@@ ences affect complex calculation when you should increase the interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low am U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the U.S. staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now he says that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is none of the main ones of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the final effect , the F@@ ed Monetary Fund has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of the former Lei@@ ters Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could reduce its monetary expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ woven with each other , they can not only monitor the developments at another point , but also with other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your decision @-@ making is &quot; more art &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ re@@ actions on financial market movements that seems to be linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
pain@@ er , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , used for a interest increase , made decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its conduc@@ tivity to 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recogni@@ zable effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed Repres@@ entative made these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only set aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the market collapse in 2008 , Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the interest of the Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to go into the situation where they are afraid of an interest rate because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t believe that they should fores@@ ee the time .

Brasili@@ a Pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric organization Spr@@ S tries to clarify women about how important good food during the down@@ time is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake around 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that should make mothers .
a recent study under the management of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can influence the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der sports hall
the Municip@@ ality Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euros in sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat for solar system .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ out building on the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports grounds come forward to step forward : in the recent community meeting , the construction application has been en@@ forced without great discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of planning is the use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; in this way , we get a wonderful large southern roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Klinik Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital of Pei@@ ßen@@ berg is expected to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new director at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the employees draw from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this will see the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the Land@@ circle , the farmer Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed .
however , a decision about the Supervisory Board , and the Prosecutor on the upcoming Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans are implemented , all of the almost 50 employees would continue to continue at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should be moved by fishermen and the further existing inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the staff who cannot be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered in Wei@@ l@@ heim a workplace , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed about the plans .
the bill triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only a medical director of Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik , and now has a private practice near the hospital .
the question , who should start the succession , came according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; in the game that declared ready to take over the direction of October 1 , and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

for the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board agree , both houses run until then next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ement , which is still more than 35 beds , has to be concluded in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the local district had planned this for 2018 when the current renovation is completed at Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

there are currently a short @-@ time maintenance of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what could not happen to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with unanim@@ ous citizens around the last affordable apartments .
in order to cover the demand for affordable apartments , 400@@ ,000 new units must be built up to 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this result is a study on behalf of the &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : in this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
in this way 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer required after the first three months of their stay as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation .
many then hit the apartment market and rows into the long queu@@ es in front of the rental apartments .
according to Statisti@@ cal Federal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only in the rising refugee numbers .
the study also makes considerable constitu@@ tions in the housing policy of the last few years .
Germany is going to be a housing deficit prior to year , which will be bigger from year to year .
currently , Matthias Günther , author of the study were currently missing in the ball@@ ast areas .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities not@@ hing@@ ed in WG rooms .
young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama because of the fleet on the housing market .
in the large cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a in recent years has declined again for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; proposes a new start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives for the social housing should be restored again .
in this way , it could be wai@@ ved to the atro@@ phy tax and will be exposed to the property for subsidi@@ zed apartments .
according to the alliance , an attractive tax @-@ tax depreci@@ ation is necessary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a good week after the start was launched on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros .
now the project could even be sto@@ cked .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia are cor@@ ridor
Hungary is practically no longer available , since then more refugees choose the way over Croatia .
Zagreb announces the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian Interior Minister , and when it is necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already one of the Schengen zone .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after the depreci@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees were broken down to Croatia to get to Western Europe .
500 people were come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television ens@@ ender was reported .
Hungary had sealed his border for refugees before the day .
new laws , which were in force on the same day , are virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic declared : &quot; you can travel through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , people who don &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police had opened the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbourhood of Croatia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of these came media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they came with the bus as well as with Ta@@ xes in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
in the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees are not far from the border @-@ f@@ enced .
the border strips of other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 90@@ s .
min@@ ers should now create a safe passage .
after the closing of the border there was hardly any more refugees after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday the police counted 36@@ 6 people .
shortly before the gate on Monday there were still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws are overcoming overcoming and damage the border z@@ a@@ us as a criminal .
in the south Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
the Sent@@ enced prison sentences up to five years and the dep@@ ortation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were taken on Tuesday , of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
there are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stopped .
however , no one has a view to receive asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ex@@ chan@@ ted asylum seek@@ ers should be cut down there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to wake up .
they collected the garbage , which had left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks .
pl@@ ywood were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps was rebuilt in the border place .
to the aim of this building , no one wanted to express himself .
after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees reach .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants were still in the country , but still in the country .
in Salzburg , approximately 1400 people are waiting for Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the assignment of German authorities .
in Frei@@ ght , smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
mayor drove &quot; ge@@ str@@ and@@ ete &quot; about the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to pass by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany on Sunday , however , because of the refugee stream of the railway station with Austria it was surprising for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the bases together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before we visited the un@@ hoped guests first , with J@@ ause and drinks .
we have said that we will bring them to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t take it to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tra@@ vers@@ ed train pass@@ ers had risen on Sunday evening in W@@ els from an ICE into a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to try it after the short @-@ term pro@@ clam@@ ation that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still trying to try over the border .
but the regional train was placed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein on the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ party association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday closed , on the day before a branch @-@ run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather than in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately help to help the establishment of structures that guarantee human@@ eness , our Chancellor has officially officially declared the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of the National Soci@@ alism .
suffering from these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic states now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poultry will also have to find that the &quot; praised country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the praised country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which she invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will become a great challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the near winter , to establish decent conditions for protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad on the search for 3@@ 5,000 winter solid quartz
Konrad has fully equi@@ ped all hands with the refugees .
Christian Konrad is it used to be his word weight .
the government has used the former mighty Raiff@@ eisen Ban@@ ker to set up qu@@ arti@@ ere for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the First Trial Centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already received Konrad already in the grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria had come to Austria without a large host , Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Interior spoke about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a need of 8@@ 5,000 quar@@ es in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already led talks with the regional representatives .
they would have secured him to create qu@@ arti@@ ere even for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it is good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born to help the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordin@@ ator also relies on the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , private individuals can easily offer accommodations .
in addition , you are hoping for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in emergency times it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ator must hold a certain height of the towel holder or size of the surface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards need to apply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , Konrad was founded with his experience in contrast to the Interior Ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older Lord , which one does not say without further into the face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power of persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er does not cause any costs as they declared themselves .
their number of employees want to increase them on three to four .
the own quantum search was not yet successful yet .
Konrad wanted to put a container on Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there is obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
not only the opening of urban sports hall and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design Center for the accommodation of refugees plans the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the people who are currently taking place without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
but for an emergency , other locations should be checked for their exchange .
criticism of the city leader in the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) announced the further action in the refugee question .
Seeh@@ o@@ fer has assured me that the German limits will not be sealed .
the transfer of refugees into the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer give it any more .
however , the protection seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , the wise heads of our raw material - and we must try to work for us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine to invest in start @-@ up companies of the New Wer@@ ft , and later to acc@@ use them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Land Ober@@ österreich and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is seen from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual surface in the building are already rented , for more 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the Arctic
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are located in the new shop .
Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to set up a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally , it now has an increase in the form of another business calendar .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop compared to the business , in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and a wall of different manufacturers , everything about women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , monetary exchange rates are from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday , the new shop is in operation .
previously several weeks was rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was among other things that the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna are at home from the idea of an own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the One who sell this brand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has put Br@@ eit of her mother into the cra@@ dle .
I &apos;m interested in most when something developed and I can show new trends at competitive prices .
why so some woman at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in ornam@@ ents can also be answered with the final safety .
perhaps it is because a nice bag is used every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came out of a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property combines some people with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good .
whether he expresses foreign language , journalists or knowledge of knowledge in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. pres@@ idency of the election campaign is strongly encouraged to the election campaign .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property have come from the real estate .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ hair@@ ur is a concept of many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf at the Wein@@ straße .
some people in the 1200 inhabitants place is related over -@@ zig corners with him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that is somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter species &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spr@@ inkl@@ es , beside Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for circumc@@ ision , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of the heart .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is a bit a big mau@@ l , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
acci@@ dentally loud the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - too high @-@ German : the An@@ ders says it .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold graves .
foundations of the real estate company were first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of sight : their desire to return to home , failed at the Bavarian State , which belonged to the Pal@@ at@@ inate at that time .
he did not receive Tr@@ ump , because he was once without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , was explained to the film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ ration . &quot;
this stands in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the night .

&quot; as the pol@@ ite , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative tr@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Win@@ zer sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

they were better when he did not know the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;

today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who dis@@ closes with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spectators .
critics had asked if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and struck slightly The block ( 83@@ 8,@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half an hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e resulted in average 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half an hour ( 17 : 30 a.m. to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped up to 6@@ 23.@@ 000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13.@@ 000 ) .
at the Monday evening the first half an hour from The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour attracted 7@@ 20.000 .
hot @-@ seat average 6@@ 20.000 .
the drop in the quotes of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that hot @-@ seat will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollar minute that did not manage the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret un@@ veiled ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may possibly have been ignor@@ ant who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , with Sam Wood in The bach@@ elor &apos;s degree , was covered in the greatest secret places .
and no one of the three remaining girls will certainly not give price if it is the one that has received the last Rose .
but when we with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before three two will be checked , you may possibly acci@@ dentally be given a hint that he will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed up to the final on Thursday .
all three women have left in ly@@ rical ways why Wood is the perfect man and knew his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as the reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last Rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki knew both quickly - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on the earth , it makes so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood as a pair would be well suited .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house@@ visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; of the One could be .
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now subject to it now , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked to choose wen Wood , if not she , she was r@@ ät@@ sel@@ ess .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girl alike - it &apos;s an un@@ decided between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the bach@@ elor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 o &apos;clock .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in the United States - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers had to verb@@ ose Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a triangle as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ vert at his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t return and also into the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues his true face in the dressing cabin after the game .
instead of grinding his R@@ ook@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged by special teams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who has been encouraged to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ ched at a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first game of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings .
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian battle for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the game field and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne ple@@ aded the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut at that time in 2007 when a passport led to a t@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in 2007 .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ olds .

Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it gave them during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .

asylum seek@@ ers want to push the free vot@@ ers as quickly as possible .
therefore Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more personnel for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum systems : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we br@@ anded nation@@ wide standards of the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot at the prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke in the district of Rup@@ an@@ expands , about 175 miles west from the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Lei@@ feld District Apostle , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside a police station , some of you threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said , the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot into the air before they returned to rubber .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber slip from which it is known that they can kill them , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently a high death rate produced .
the confron@@ tation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ as southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ ati@@ i say that new provinces will be formed as part of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the Western Nepal of the ethnic group of Th@@ arus , who want to have a own state .
at least 40 people , among them 11 police officers , were in violent disputes since 10 .
August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal that has been centrally governed by centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way , but the legislature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legislature announced this week about certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kath@@ mandu , and officials told that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .

Google launches Ver@@ dou@@ bt@@ ful Don@@ ations campaign to collect € 11 million for refugees

Google has an unusual personal approach at the announcement of the donations call on his blog .
rather than a manager to leave the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about their personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey belonged to many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and anxiety , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had luck .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately seek help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

reporting of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; processing by Christian Pl@@ umb
for easy over@@ weight diab@@ etics can be helpful for weight loss surgery .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly over@@ weight people live with diabetes after the weight loss surgery longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery .
weight loss surgery or Adi@@ posit@@ as surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies have been carried out with people who are infected with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered as obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of Adi@@ posit@@ as surgery - Mag@@ enb@@ ypass and Mag@@ en@@ coder formation - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I under those who were subjected to this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained at those who have not received surgical diabetes treatments approximately at the same time at 29 .
among those who subjected to a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease dissolved in total and at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , in comparison with the diabetes , the diabetes only dissolved in one percent and partly only about two percent .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; found the authors .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels in the course of time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is kept best under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mort@@ ality in five years , thus the researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also includes average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , higher returns in the BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.@@ 1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study has no survival advantage of surgery after five years , there are evidence of a study of serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who were subjected to obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 which are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation in this lower BM@@ I group is lower , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have been linked to their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love history plays in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is currently taking attention in the Bell@@ et@@ ris@@ tik : a young woman , at school times un@@ popular and un@@ expect@@ edly , meets the warm of her youth , and he loves her in her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot record all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the real solution of refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders urged to end violence in the refugees of refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke to the issue of ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries will be admi@@ red to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts are praised by the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , like a true peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence never solved these problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke to the problem of violence and commented on George Bus@@ hs &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack from September 11 , and presented that the US @-@ violent reaction of the United States moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my confes@@ sion in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
toxins in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swal@@ low the strong alcoholic hand inf@@ ect@@ ants , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues generated by hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the poison control centres report , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 on 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant , while some are doing to impress their friends , or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have suppos@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with non @-@ alcoholic oral water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be embroi@@ dered by attractive no@@ zzles of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ ted .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange du@@ ft which are very appealing for children .
ham@@ de@@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol .
a few sprit@@ zer can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ ck whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ringe from after earthquake frag@@ ran@@ ces in school was brought into a emergency stop for the treatment .
your blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally valid for adults , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ebook doctor who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was not able to go when they arrived in the emergency room .
doctors supervised them overnight in a separate child &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very anxi@@ ous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
for alcohol pois@@ oning , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of Hän@@ de@@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product meth@@ anol contained a fatal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students planned the fourth class in New York , their &quot; gem@@ s &quot; teacher by pois@@ oning anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says it a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to ham@@ let inf@@ ect@@ ants and verb@@ ose them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected discipl@@ ined measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show highlights of Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here are not only talking about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .

after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the following exp@@ iry of the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , which now stand on the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had already had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly - but we must continue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really need the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the player better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it is important to stand together .

as the security personnel could not be able to peace , the workers called the police .
only with the use of pep@@ per@@ spray , the officials could take the stor@@ er in awareness .
a breath of breathing resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0,@@ 89 Pro@@ mil@@ le .
the approach was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 Pro@@ mil@@ le and remained first in the awareness .
why I will be witness of an ex@@ ec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
something later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p will be executed by the toxic injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day was near@@ er , I began to fear me .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications than places available , a ma@@ cable lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites of 12 to five .
who will be selected , who will observe it too .
I cannot do this .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ ps close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship in the course of months with telephone and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants , and you will receive access .
I compl@@ ained to you .
she said that she would have been able to form@@ ulate it , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do .
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told him that he can remove from his list of witnesses at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot tell you that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of deed .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
I think it is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters that you can turn for .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man to die un@@ necessary death .
man after hum@@ idi@@ fied police persec@@ utor hun@@ ted out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he over@@ spoke the man from the C@@ anning River .
a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in the sil@@ ky and sum@@ p@@ tuous water , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the bank . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house @-@ peaceful incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ icious , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; a good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
master football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 C@@ ous@@ ins drove to the tren@@ ch to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish the race sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he joined the Ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for the racing sport and he has found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobal@@ t test sample at Li@@ dar@@ i which he cannot explain .
he had returned to 18 months because of the spi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to see how too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but sometimes you are so fru@@ strated that everything comes out once &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live what I said .
I &apos;m going to go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to walk around , and I want my owners think I try my best for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they start thinking , I do not do this , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had left the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integr@@ ity department had tried to spy his stable .
&quot; ten months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - I will be asked if I &apos;ll be asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a subject .
if this is the case , they should certainly take care of their nos@@ es because they have failed to write me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , official President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should I think that it will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave in fei@@ ting , and perhaps people outside of trainers are responsible for what is happening in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people think out that I am .
perhaps they have to take me my license , and I have no doubt that what I say to think about it now .
but I have arrived at the point where the matter is , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will exercise the pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ stration level of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to him that he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ open master Black Vodka , recorded the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or sound was applied to the horse @-@ deb@@ tor , which was opposed to the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take over the full responsibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been so last night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have been so far as it was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it was so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month discount for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who put these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules but here is too far &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man to driver cur@@ sed
the police arrested a man after a cl@@ ash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley motorway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said the car driver continued to stop without stopping the last driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Monday , a 50 @-@ year old man made from Nath@@ alia of the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be charged with the driver &apos;s cur@@ sed and subordin@@ ate assistance and because of other traffic del@@ ights .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals due to asser@@ tions to Ring@@ fight
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised criticism of his player as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring@@ ing &quot; with his team during the high Storm winner in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a scar@@ ed note to the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers at his team was confident that they were worried about being defeated by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring events when she said to us 24 : 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing at our def@@ ensive system or the techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tics for a real focus , and that has been the trend turn for us .
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . it is therefore probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is already funny as this happens again to this season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Prime Minister League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
he took his play on Saturday evening with our Sunday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they play .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they did not think of us when it went to Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the play Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not have any points of tension@@ ing ?
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Storm team will be free at this weekend as they have the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit to drug situation
a man who might have a lifel@@ ong punishment threat@@ ens to come to the possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were mu@@ ff@@ led to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the German police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America over Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ accused during the morning and later in the café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly viable punishment for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the Jud@@ ge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the threat of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday .
in the case of the criminal case , he lied the police over his residence .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach his release .
&quot; after reading the dis@@ appearance of the two people , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Jud@@ ge Flan@@ ag@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that alone will not be sufficient to hold it from it , he warned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against the deposit , under the conditions that he reports his austr@@ alian and its Serbian pass , and at the police daily reports on a daily starting point of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driving licence apart
on the evening , a truck driver had been severely injured at the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe .
two of the three participating trucks had stopped in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left to the left as the police hur@@ ried .
the licence from the accident caused by accident .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely locked over six hours to 2 pm .
there was a damage in height of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to attract P@@ hil@@ oph@@ ile to the end of images
a P@@ hil@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to challenge images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl when this slept , log@@ ically placed in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of unnecessary pictures of children who were sent to him from another user .
the girl awak@@ ened later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it by , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ arm@@ ated immediately her mother .
the police took care of this and saw the five images , analysed then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , the terms for searching for un@@ touched pictures of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g claimed that he had done it because it would lead to &quot; pon@@ oph@@ ile &quot; on the internet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he then gave &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addi@@ ction that he is ad@@ dic@@ tive to fri@@ ghten people .
he gave him that the search was carried out on the computer of him , but said that it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten punishment .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he did to attract them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and the wines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also looked at the un@@ touched pictures on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ end@@ ants .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused Computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation was used to speak with girls who saw much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , explained in the sense of the indictment , un@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , and not before judgment to a hearing on 24 March this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g appears not in the Registry of Sex@@ ual Stra@@ ft@@ ä@@ ter because one could argue that &quot; there is no considerable sexual element in his understanding .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael lost the verdi@@ ct until October to obtain background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case , but was held in case of hearing on other cases in case of hearing .
he was still recorded before the date of the urine into the directory of sexual criminal off@@ ences .
Schle@@ user soft to small border transi@@ tions to Germany
more and more refugees are taken away from the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks made from fear of discovery and arrest the people increasingly increase in smaller border transi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the German police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
along the border flow Inn , Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn have been accessed over 1000 refugees since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and reser@@ vo@@ irs to the German side .
they will be taken from the German police in reception and for@@ warded to registration .
on the Munich main station , the Federal Police Department met again in comparison to the beginning of the weekend on Wednesday .
at 8 : 00 AM , around 700 people arrived in the capital of the capital , a speaker said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border had reached the city on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees .
Stuttgart : extinction of the Trop@@ ical Tower &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against Stur@@ mb@@ ö@@ en in the Sou@@ thwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm marine air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
the powerful t@@ ief was the prec@@ urs@@ or of the drop@@ let of the &quot; Henry , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic over the past few days .
severe storms and thunder@@ storms are expected to be expected in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , it is also early in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ seek@@ reis with goats from 60 to 90 hours miles .
on Friday , there is no longer a look at the sun again .
the mass makes it : all two years show the cars on the I@@ AA their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , this is particularly well @-@ selling movement in the compact car , which is currently particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : about 28,@@ 1 per cent of the new approvals , according to power station Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment .
this is reflected in the I@@ AA ( publication days 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept vehicles and new Ober@@ kl@@ as@@ se@@ - and luxury cars , many new compact models are presented in this year .
one of the largest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , who will stand in autumn during the dealers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
so that the volume model also sells well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Opel introduces an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view that starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only one fifth .
the second variant will be followed in the spring of the com@@ bi that is already seen on the I@@ AA .
and what will be done next to the Astra at the I@@ AA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively seen as a fifth part in a conventional and a stressed sporty GT version .
in the trade he is coming next year , then as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan boom wants to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti fits perfectly into the design line of the brand .
the base model will get a gasoline engine with a performance of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , among them a newly developed 1.0 liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is equivalent to 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact small dell DS 4 , which is seen on the I@@ AA .
the designer of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid hand in front of all hand at the front end : here the radiator grill was newly drawn and equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch@@ screen and integrated the Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play for the first time .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are decent
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the judicial system Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners have fundamentally claim financial compensation when they are housed in small cells .
this decision adopted the Federal Constitutional Court in one on Wednesday .
the affected persons may even hope to hope for money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the narrow spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters floor space ; the toilet was not separate .
after that , the man who moved to his lawyer was now on free foot in a larger cell .
due to the un@@ worthy arrest conditions against the country of Berlin , he failed .
but the Constitutional Court took up the verdi@@ ct of the Chamber of Kammer@@ geri@@ es Berlin and returns the case to renewed testing .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity hurt .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even though from legal reasons of the question@@ able period only a few days of detention for compensation was decisive , an equ@@ ation was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of money compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of criminal prisoners in the past .
thus they spoke only in April to a prisoner of damages because he was imprisoned in a cell in a cell .
human @-@ un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 as well as the multiple occupancy of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to a decent lodging in November 2009 in a parallel accident in November 2009 .
the former pl@@ ain@@ ees was accommod@@ ated over three months between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to the head@@ lines in recent weeks .
prisoners will therefore be returned to 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to pun@@ ish it , because of the alleged situation .
according to the information of the judicial system , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the young people , 19 shall fall away from 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor decided to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Interior in this year to Germany , according to Viz@@ ek@@ anz@@ ler Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated its extraordinary challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create this , and we can create that . &quot;
what is coming to Germany is the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 35@@ 0,000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space but especially for affordable rental objects : annually , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments are coming out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments , refugees will also apply .
the Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments have to be created every year and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
in addition , scientists and federal ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in the housing construction .
according to estimates of the Institute for Labour Market and Professional Research , the long @-@ term 55 percent of the poultry can be employed in Germany .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically for their qualifications to help them at the entrance , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Mig@@ ration@@ alist Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , a political turn was given : the ban on refugees for the recognition of work .
while there was a job ban for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residen@@ cy light , the asylum seek@@ ers limited to a residence .
in society - also because of the skilled labour - a majority of view that refugees should be able to allow refugees to be able to access the labour market faster .
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German knowledge .
so far , there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most common through personal contacts .
the development of networks is therefore according to the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt of the Königs@@ weg to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents put their children into the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the horri@@ ble parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , Spe@@ aker for Youth and Family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family from the benefits of K@@ ita , the administration is distributed in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators are strongly rising by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more professional schools .
students are prepared for students without German knowledge in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ amp from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
Studi@@ er@@ wil@@ ful refugees could be facilit@@ ated to the university .
for refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ ce do not receive services according to the asylum seek@@ er law , if they begin studying .
the latter is basically not a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , because they don &apos;t fall under the circle of legitimate individuals .
the patient had to have lived for four years in Germany to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1st January 2016 , this Span@@ dex short@@ ened to 15 months .
but this financial gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play an important role in the future , for many refugees are Muslims , and for many is the religion more important part of their identity .
the state should follow Islam succ@@ essive the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches right to develop a new state of religions .
it is important that the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , which professionally takes care of the new ank@@ ind .
the rights belong to the rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the representatives of Islam must be on clear contact with the state in many areas and have certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also part of the willingness to present themselves against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the concern , religious conflicts may also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
this means that the majority of the majority of society must change , the degra@@ dation of discrimination and rac@@ ism is urgent .
Germany , as a result of European decisions , has been an anti @-@ discrimination site and a general equality law .
but it is very slow to learn how the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie showed that the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motif .
the same chances for all : what Mig@@ rant organisations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for a long time and what international treaty like the Anti@@ rac@@ ism Convention Germany must become reality when the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , the doctor says Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what MAN@@ - Power and Cap@@ acities is concerned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needs to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls for all arri@@ vals at the same time when regi@@ stering health cards .
later , services could be calculated later with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , so many people with the limited range of services are subject to the asylum seek@@ er law .
otherwise the doctors make their language barriers mainly .
so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proved to be worse about their illnesses as other patients .
not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ters would have to be taken over .
many refugees have also been helped with more general medical applications in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
among refugee camps , there are much more untreated disabilities , and the young people go to HIV education .
with the partially other diseases of the German doctors from their training , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite damage or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so hard to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to practice practice , however , they need to prove their qualifications , and possibly ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany , according to estimates of the Federal psych@@ otherap@@ ist chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z explains President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study conducted by TU Munich , that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with breath @-@ not , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat and death .
other symptoms are sleeping and concentration problems , strong scar@@ ce and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , an early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z declared .
so far , only four percent of the psych@@ ic sick refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy .
although psych@@ ologically sick asylum seek@@ ers can present a request for a psych@@ otherapy , but the processing usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social workers , experts or doctors who are not trained for psychological diseases , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ estim@@ ations , says Mun@@ z .

&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine without living my cir@@ cus family &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current maneu@@ ver .
since more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family .
so the family is in the blood , so the family is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to take away people from their everyday life and take it for two hours in a completely different world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov Clo@@ wn Family attracts the audience with joke and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the st@@ um@@ mers , the Cub@@ an duo wants to loose the Cub@@ an duo .
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is to conquer women &apos;s her@@ ring in the storm .
besides numerous salmon sal@@ ts the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger@@ tips and artic@@ ulation .
to balance the wheel on a ball ?
for He Yuan no problem .
snake people are fascinating and fri@@ ghtened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascinated with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .

ab@@ duc@@ tions in the attitude of cir@@ cus are only too often subject to different animal welfare organizations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes its position : &quot; it is not good for our animals , but it is not good . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are lov@@ ingly called , will be read according to every wish of the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal doesn &apos;t feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to be in the man@@ ege .
so the top commandment is : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the family is proud .
the two animals have lived together eight years in a secret , and nothing is happening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
for each visitor , it is likely to be something .
&quot; one thing is safe , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with a whole heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 and 20 p.m. to his performances .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 and 16 o &apos;clock .
Thursday is a family day , for the presentation at 17 : 00 the prices are reduced .
in addition , the animal show is open from 10 to 18 o &apos;clock .
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down at the beginning of the year by a podium down the stairs .
he remained unchanged , but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was forced by the claims of members of the opposition to receive anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ called .
last month they took him out and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday .
the speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions of SMS messages received SMS messages on their mobile phones who warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ es .
she warns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity ends in parliament , and as soon as they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Party of Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is building up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build up 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
in this year , HP will divide into two listed companies and split the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in a declaration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise is smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a wide and broad portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing an integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says a declaration of the company .
it is divided into a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s from the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has passed a massive restructuring in order to cope with the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on conviction that closely focused companies provide a better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Kapitän Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September , and if his rehabilitation goes to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old tail during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of violation is not threatened by the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that is not well healed .
this is no greater matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his ank@@ le or with injuries that he had before .
this may be true from purely medical sight , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the risk of other injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops a non @-@ pleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five game times .
the broader picture of arsen@@ al is that they were in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs that have the most vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in vulner@@ ability during the last season will continue .
&quot; sometimes if you come back from a violation , you have a reasonable time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane on the coming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to treat a little break @-@ break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al is clear favor@@ ites , through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is un@@ beaten after 41 games after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake , whereby at the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.2 were measured .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has moved from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains driven by the distant hope , with his management the association to his first European elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked with arsen@@ al .
we were very close to the year 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ aming .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open , now even more desperate than ever before , as self @-@ murder among young men on a 15 @-@ year h@@ och prove .
in 2013 it was the most important cause of death in men at the age of 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and three times more frequently in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ania ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pe@@ arly life ) 2015 is the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture in question , the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the battle to master this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that when the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery is doubled .
for those who are not depres@@ sive , hal@@ ved a circle of mentally healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
in the age of social media , communication with its focus on style about substance is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital life have the need to appear strong , lifel@@ ong and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values call ; money , image , social status , all at cost intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty in Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
every character has not been defined by his work but by his personality , which sh@@ ines through interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when football gu@@ cks and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can refer to any case even if they often hold back to explore completely their feelings .
like a staff of telep@@ hon@@ esty I explained : ... &quot; my listening role for people who are depres@@ sive and self @-@ employed , has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old speech &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you speak about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to me when I try to offer long @-@ term control mechanisms .
she presents quite clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status of the phone will help people in moments of despair too , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely newly designed setting , why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you can see in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say Hello .
you never know which difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets PS@@ G to help Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut in Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani kept course , as Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the principle stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G players who brought the French Master on the way , but then they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased its previous jump as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k , Paris also needs a strong start against Swedish masters , as they do not only strive for the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no class@@ mate of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs . he was later in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he started his career in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents problems and look back back , even if there are certain things that we have to do in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two more gates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes in Paris @-@ Team , which could keep on the weekend a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was sto@@ cked in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine wing door was referred to as the man who was taken over to the next level in Europe when he was taken over the last month of Manchester United States , and he explained why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he concluded Johan Wil@@ and over the long corner of the network .
if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory that was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Cel@@ tic in an Play @-@ off to reach this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field , a serious opponent .
but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sts in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave himself up , with some flaws and bad agreements , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was not less than five trials alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the restart .
nevertheless he pointed out much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which turned to Di Maria into a revol@@ t , which was guided by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the track .
the second gate finally fell short after the hours brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . his sixth season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had found a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all thought that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the end result low before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi became a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we played only in the Swedish League that has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games are not sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented from 2008 to FC Bayern
world and Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern obviously stood shortly before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played the FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times Po@@ kal@@ winner , four times champ@@ ions champion , two times Club World Champion , two times European champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in summer , 35 @-@ year @-@ olds left the FC Barcelona and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now advis@@ es that he had already stood before the f@@ arewell from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered FC Bayern registered .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was a offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man is working today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken over the contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has been excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erischer Spiel@@ zeit 2008 / 2009 was run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter final of Champions League against the entire distance on the lawn , the Red ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the royal classes triumph at the end .

&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; cro@@ wned first champion
professional sport climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ with home .
the competition show that had just completed her 7th season , had never experienced a contest participants who could conclude all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten until the finale .
the last task was the climbing on a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time when he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fighting victory , still under the shock of the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ earned or to life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. how I can &apos;t imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood rep@@ orter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , even though he ended the course at all , not any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than a fin@@ alists , it receives the fastest time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great gra@@ ti@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he wins any more .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he received from fans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is so a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I should be beaten by someone , I am glad that Isaac is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had de@@ pressed the roles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior has been extended for an A@@ ight Season , which will start shooting in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers by Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for Detroit Tig@@ ers .
earlier , they were one of the best teams in Bas@@ eb@@ all , today the tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins disappeared a chance to climb inside a game of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F word that was so hard to write about a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held its early offensive support as Detroit three times in the first two interior , then once in the sixth and then once in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in 1 / 3 inside and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year too strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bul@@ l@@ pen every game and therefore I want to go into the game .
the designed Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , its first r@@ ust since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good out of the ( stroke training ) , looked much better in the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it right into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the In@@ ning with a double on the left field line .
Right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man who was confronted with whom he was confronted with the designer R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who broke the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run .
the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe took the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was that in the Major League leading 27 times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a Double Play
after Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth interior , the Wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loose of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and posted the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , S@@ ano , however , was made of three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited to the launch of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two Inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been kn@@ itted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list , after having missed more than one month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt more comfortable and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch in the third place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed by a single on the right hand , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tiger set in the second , achieved One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a great blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about military action options without Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he threw the European states &quot; collective directions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was glad that the Kel@@ ch passed a military participation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also demanded a massive increase in international assistance for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has introduced its controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner stated on the evening evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , after Hungary , no one will be sent back .
in Germany , Germany has no refugees returned to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of an agreement after Germany could take a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , I have already given the talks between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
they did not call concrete figures and rejected talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria by the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann applied a special summit for next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in view of the strong refugee camps in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries with the first recording and distribution of people .
the covenant will jointly manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced at the late service evening after almost four @-@ hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister of the Chancellor in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who want to protect the protection against them .
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany .
this view was divided into the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chancellor stressed the state as a whole &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge power supply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia in the night .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest , even the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent tu@@ gs from escap@@ ing about Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there were first associations of people who had gone through the fence .
in Turkey , thousands of more migrants were in the way to the Greek border .

no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain much sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slender line will often fall away from them .
because Man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially sac@@ char@@ ose .
healthy are the exotic fruits anyway : in them B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Before all , Man@@ gos contain plenty of vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
whoever e@@ ats the fruits , thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too strong and smell pleasant .
the shell colour alone says nothing about how ripe fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste very tasty .
you should store in room temperature and consume within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet food .
but there is also a man@@ go , but also hear@@ ty dishes a special note .
it mil@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some bl@@ at@@ ts@@ al@@ ates like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

first F@@ öhn@@ sturm , then marked cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ord@@ side of the hair dryer through , such as Mete@@ o@@ Switzerland ha@@ sten@@ ed on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night , the hair dryer partially bl@@ ends with storm strength through the fet@@ ters .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we crossed a striking cold front , which brings strong ra@@ inf@@ alls , wind turbines and a temperature decline .
as Mete@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area over the British islands in a strong south @-@ west stream .
on the Alp@@ enn@@ ord@@ side , in the night , the hair dryer will break through the valleys .
as a result of the hair dryer until Thursday morning in the fet@@ al valleys with goats from 60 to 100 km / h , and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land , partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the hair dryer can pass through to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains are even Or@@ kan@@ bö@@ en from over 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture at the Alp@@ ens@@ ü@@ d@@ hang begins .
there is rain that keeps up until Thursday evening .
in sum , the south of the Alps must be counted in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 liters of rain per square meters , this after the last days are already big rain .
on Thursday morning there is a cold front with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from West to East over Switzerland .
along with the cold front of the wind , the wind is strong to stor@@ my , and the temperatures go back .
the following days are present in the north her@@ b@@ st@@ ably with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , in the south , it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
just 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square .
in the presence of City President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a well @-@ known place in the park on the Opp@@ io hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Arbeits@@ gemeinschaft of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , remembered that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often only in secret their faith .
the place will be visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ iner@@ m@@ ön@@ ch in 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he received the city at that time as promised sinners .
his negative impressions should be strengthened by histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated his thes@@ es against Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ andel the split of the Greek Church .
hammer artists invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar has painted old for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and Bible texts updated .
at the beginning was the word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with splendid pictures .
at the beginning , the image of Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means equal to &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary , the respective subjects can be adapted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cy@@ cycles , which are dedicated to themes such as cross @-@ way , pl@@ agues , commandments , or father@@ hood .
in this way , he is fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who set himself on the basis of painting with the respective Bible passages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translated by Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transl@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al mirror of al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible of Martin Luther and each one set of the artist who formulated his own personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden spoon .
thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter @-@ Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pipe stock &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work for me , perhaps again with the Lord Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help the art in faster time again : &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped today by Rek@@ l@@ ame , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures have always something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to leave the viewer into the images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discover and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like to understand how he takes life with his pictures . &quot;
old did not care to grasp the Bible completely , but also selected for him important , even mysterious issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no collaboration on eye height , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text explains merely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en &quot; his life &quot; and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that is opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Foundation .
construction start for BM@@ X rail
plans made , place found , company commissioned to model@@ ed pe@@ an@@ gel for a round course : one year later , almost everything was finished - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway , it was once again .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration covered for off@@ ences , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t toler@@ ate the train .
so hills moved up , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permits .
the approval will enter in October , the first community of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to share in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ Chef Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chancellor and meet the State Minister Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

that all 36 licensing associations had started their own projects , be great .
it is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we have spent is lived in football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the German Federal Government are available to 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .

the Executive Board of Europe &apos;s largest software Group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost several reports by a fall in July the left eye lost .
during the accident at the staircase in the house of his brother in the United States , he fell after midnight on a water glass that he had worn in the left hand , reports the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet the Supervisory Board at Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue the software company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , fully in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I stood at regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t is usually between Germany and the USA , since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is important to go with such personal history to the public , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes on a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us have finally broken off in the first group game of Europe League .
the national player will be missing the table leader of the football Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot rely on him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will return to Le@@ verk@@ usen in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B Coach opened : &quot; we expect a return from him to the workout on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high loading of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its stem from the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change on the door@@ step position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes place the place of tribe of Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised the World Champion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in the future in all Europe League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
with high probability , he will also ride the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so wrong &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marco Wei@@ gl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not so wrong &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to attack the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ cars : government plans for Germany &apos;s pioneering role for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a leader in the transformation of the car .
the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a strategy of Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday at Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
the automated and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less stress , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he also wants to discuss the topic with his local colleagues from the G@@ 7 states that come together with representatives of the industry .
the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier of the Transport Ministry also emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band construction and a fast move on digital radio stations .
for testing new technology , there is currently a test track on the 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be no additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 hours .
the Federal Government also wants to use the Vienna Convention for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has only seen the people as drivers .
when automated driving takes over , the car takes the lead , the driver gets more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
following a study by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways to 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , mobile vehicles are expected to expect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far to 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany appreciate the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more security and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD traffic officer S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and security of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are yet skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA @-@ Institute of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute in order of the test for@@ gan@@ isation Dek@@ ra comes to the result that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars will be able to prevail in the coming ten years , 32 per cent are only expected to believe 31 percent at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents to 2025 with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital verb@@ al bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control during the entire journey on all roads .
at the highway you could imagine 15 percent in the flowing traffic , in St@@ au 45 percent .
good every V@@ ated would allow the car to control the control under no circumstances .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an end@@ ant .
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presents an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins , which are fri@@ ghtening thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as Stage out@@ fits to the great star of fashion scene - and so that he plug@@ ged men into skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say today that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( from Ci@@ tiz@@ stei@@ g to the run@@ ste@@ g ) , which is seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his initial attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , one comes into the museum .
the impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into that hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall art work for which a lot of effort was operated : to keep the doll@@ s , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged .
14 tonnes of material have made the power of the cur@@ ator by Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest , a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l was still a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather h@@ osen outfit with cork .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are schl@@ auer as men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
Gau@@ l@@ ti@@ ers old Ted@@ dy is also seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tender @-@ fashi@@ oned walk of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents had not allowed him .
the throw of fashion was then brought to himself later .
he made steel fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later , I bought it , but of course I bought it .
for his first own fashion show he didn &apos;t have to pay the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the cl@@ ots .
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener lace as fashion @-@ niche
in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around pl@@ auen to make a meter .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in a large amount of customers that they worked for example to blank@@ ets and curtains .
this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ vies Pl@@ auen .
instead , fashion is important .
in the initial times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener tip , fashion plays a larger role , then it was pushed through the home textile industry - and is now being discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional tra@@ ps .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , ref@@ uses to re@@ jects past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , an increasing customer potential .
if you don &apos;t have any niche in the textile industry in Germany , no longer is the market .
with us , they are already half of all orders .
together with nine other companies a member of Pl@@ au@@ ener lace and embroi@@ der@@ ies are joined together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales were broken away .
private specialist stores and wholesale markets are almost no longer available .
our products can hardly reach our customers on this way .
the mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also weak@@ ening the export , currently in Russia and the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to focus on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially toler@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the snow of the West@@ Saxon University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ dery and tips .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design will often vary slightly to hold a customer base .
a few years ago , Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter was re@@ designed the historical snow@@ ball tip .
the machine runs on some places small chi@@ cks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ smith master@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße inspired him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not start with traditional Pl@@ aces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ors
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and consumers with a significantly higher dose of nerve problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who critic@@ ised a corresponding employer of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of lack of industrial and environmental policy will continue to continue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve gi@@ ver should be raised at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ gram mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ors , however , are so strong with mercury , that on the basis of the still applicable limit values , about 50 percent of the cords are not allowed to be sold .
after dup@@ lication of the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ ob@@ struc@@ tible .
the EU according to F@@ ood@@ watch wants to intensi@@ fy the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ gram mercury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch recorded this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low @-@ loaded , that they already hold the planned top values today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is one for the human being highly po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal , which is strongly enrich@@ ing over the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cause poor damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains the maximum values that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is above all due to coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information on the Federal Environment Ministry , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock gave more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total volume in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
