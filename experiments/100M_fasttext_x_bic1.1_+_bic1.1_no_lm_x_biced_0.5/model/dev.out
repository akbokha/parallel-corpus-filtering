Obama concei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about T@@ eh@@ ran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , there should also be a conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critici@@ zes Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement expansion and launches Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal between the two has wor@@ sen@@ ed by the deal of the Iranian nuclear program promoted by Obama .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partially regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election coming in Israel at the time .
in an emergency call Professor decides to have shot his girl@@ friend
in a distress call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officers had to come to his house .
lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of dead wife could be found on the phone .
inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ s and a hand @-@ written note that was scrat@@ ched on a white block : &quot; I am sorry I wanted , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , taught Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office , according to the police .
Delta State University polic@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff had heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb had done the dis@@ astro@@ us emergency call at some point .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cled him .
one day after the shooting at the university , the students and lectur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees knew , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ s died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal record .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty members included 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who pra@@ ises lamb , said he also seemed a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the Promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs@@ â s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the flight from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs &apos; trail later , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , lamb ste@@ wed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home in the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Math@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb continued to grow in the area .
lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
in the spring he did his doc@@ torate in ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs@@ led him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through shared friends .
she and her friends were in high school and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar playing several years .
at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women .
every girl mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ s were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the distress she said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no deed of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that ad@@ joins a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ s , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ s when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail occurred three years ago both on a summer fair .
later they played together the one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ s was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ s Night at night 5 . September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica pi@@ el before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no evidence that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , pres@@ ided over the first semester program and specialized in American Indi@@ genous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of the Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial service .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be added on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot and that Lamb called Pr@@ enti@@ s as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two ever married .
toys R Us plans to hire less workers for Christmas time
toys R Us says that it won &apos;t be as many Christmas seasonal workers as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it was planning to stop 4@@ 0,000 people in stores and sales centres throughout the country . 4@@ 5,000 workers were hired during the Christmas season 2014 .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees will rise from October to December .
as the holidays themselves are even months away , the Christmas business approaches , and businesses are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater awaiting the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to my mind that I am a simul@@ ated ya@@ wn and an arm &apos;s length from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; pre@@ mier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s true for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; the biggest time travel film ever made . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon said that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN boss again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ pl@@ ored that the post@@ ings in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity to face the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dism@@ issed him as a joke .
and some wait for a breakdown .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top cor@@ rid@@ ors at poll@@ s down , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the electoral period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom had only won one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ sider groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ ump &apos;s stamina and begin to drop their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
tr@@ umps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six out of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa last week found that 60 percent of rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P vot@@ ers would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a pol@@ l conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans said they would either be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of 10 say they were &quot; angry &quot; when he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say they &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans see Tr@@ ump temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish vot@@ ers ten@@ ding to the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first nation state of the nation , the State of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temp@@ er does not get into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers get used to the idea .
when they put up their swe@@ epers , rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers hold tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of the ten end of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination versus only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is evident that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ ers watch the campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ ump leadership while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is spread across more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump sums up majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , ahead of Walker 15 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally ahead of edge Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have made their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the vot@@ ers support Tr@@ ump say they have for@@ given their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with tr@@ ump on the subject of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump called in his election campaign two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; the immigration of shooting and fishing was in public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump crucial His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will be kept away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ pol@@ l from Monday six of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently do it .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s on new heights .
now on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers , above all , is due to their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they would rather have a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are mad at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in Io@@ wa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Io@@ wa rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ strated by the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg there is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street a square meter of a street @-@ roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hence the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers a square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential locations , however , one of the cost counts as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champ@@ ions League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two times Pir@@ äus in Pir@@ äus : Bayern @-@ star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern into a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pira@@ eus - then it ran .
a confident pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze delivered a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pira@@ eus .
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their first match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Göt@@ z Hit ( 8@@ 9. ) deser@@ ved with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth tournament success in series shall be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third race .
Müller received good assistance from the Champions League of the Champions League with the help of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who caused a fire of the world champion as a flan@@ k .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ blo@@ o@@ ded fans - and the Munich beha@@ ved word .
they showed a focused and dedicated performance without shining .
Pira@@ eus won his latest six home games in the top class , including famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here .
but Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went courage@@ ously , but in their offensive efforts , however , they often go to work without any effort .
the attacks were often initiated by a game shift to the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which rarely passed through the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k broke out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ so .
in the seventh minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half were Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown proposed the head ball of Poland on the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct pick@@ up , the go@@ al@@ keeper kept Roberto with his knee ( 35@@ th ) .
although the Bav@@ arians pulled up their usual dominant game , Pira@@ eus was able to set needle @-@ stit@@ ches .
on the door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neuer , however , was leaving .
so , for instance , when he directed a shot of ide@@ ye over the latte ( 5@@ 6. ) .
before New Guardi@@ ola left a four chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who did it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
the World Cup Her@@ o had only given the green light after finishing the final training , &quot; said sports director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; if you want to make something different , this is quite mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 76 . ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , with eleven meters Müller still put it on it .
in front of the game they came to Kra@@ v@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator block had obviously prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pira@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went on strike against the Munich adher@@ ents .
at least one Bayern fan was injured off the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke , not only har@@ ms the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : in case of ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk falls rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers lay the risk of losing their teeth early in order to get the 2.5 to 3.6 @-@ fold higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
root causes for tooth loss are cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the gum , empha@@ sizes DI@@ f@@ E .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore goes back to more frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to how much smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment returns to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , the author Thomas Dietrich explained by the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Hau@@ schka von DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking cuts life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , results in good dental health right up to the old age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population is affected by tooth@@ lessness in the age of 65 to 74 years , DI@@ f@@ E announced .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking may increase the risk of early loss of teeth .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists close to c@@ olog@@ s on the Rhine river on remains of late anti@@ quity
for the second time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine river in Cologne .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a department of archae@@ ology for soil preservation .
in the third section of the Rhein@@ gold bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now found five .
it was already known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with approximately 350 graves was also discovered , probably belonging to the church .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to def@@ use the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the disp@@ uted private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function clearly corresponds to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that the citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said European Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed introducing the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the Free Trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely show that the EU states and the US will jointly choose independent judges for a new investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the second instance is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow it to be objec@@ tion@@ able against judgment .
until now , the parties agreed with each other on arbit@@ rators , there was no ob@@ jection to their judg@@ ments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work towards an International Investment Court according to its own specifications .
there could then be clari@@ fied , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the Investor @-@ Sta@@ ats arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all by large corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parallel justice system by which companies can impose damage on tax pay@@ ers , negotiate national laws , or to en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organisations such as Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German State Secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great step forward .
the Commission considered important issues in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned about restri@@ cting the publishing potential of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
the negotiations on the T@@ TIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) remain un@@ clear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
so far the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be un@@ sustainable .
delicate folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Prime Club in Cologne ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the ti@@ mid @-@ looking folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost gr@@ asp@@ ed by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells of different places he always records on the map , about his me@@ tic@@ ul@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they came into being and what it looks like , in his homeland .
ever since , St@@ ev@@ ens proved to be a wonderfully creative person .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; sound composed songs that blend perfectly close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent music at any time .
it is rum@@ ored that &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 states should follow .
but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine there has already been &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; and breaks positively to some expectations .
in this case , St@@ ev@@ ens will step down here .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s survey
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s opinion has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited since his election
the new leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , is to make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s opinion and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask for the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , although his performance is likely to be checked by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary sc@@ rut@@ iny of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour Party &apos;s decision to remain silent during a comm@@ em@@ oration of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the center of several title pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ic of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme that he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; irrespective of their faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of Shadow ministers have refused to serve at Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liament@@ ary party originally supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stack@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour has made changes to remove all the idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow and worker minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth leader in the Labour Party leader David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory chief over the last decade of the Dis@@ patch Box in Parliament .
the leader of the Labour Party , who has promised another policy approach , says that he has &quot; crowd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s questions are confron@@ t@@ ational and that he will refra@@ in from both &quot; impact &quot; and stri@@ fe with det@@ achment and instead focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow of Economic Minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also had the idea to talk to other colleagues from time to time , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House of Comm@@ ons to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch &quot; theatre , often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s questions . but a few years later he admitted he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the survey was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Comm@@ ons and his position among his Par@@ liament@@ ary colleagues , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound shr@@ inks through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound sprang up immediately after data showing an increase in the growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , the result grew without any bonuses in the UK by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est and experienced assessment over the timing of an increase in interest rates since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v dealt with .
a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - once again reported growth .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the Mond@@ i packaging and paper group were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his appreciation for the company rating on &quot; selling . &quot;
JD Sports rose by 3.1 % after the reporting company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of JD Sports is saying that higher wages are je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zing expansion .
the Managing Director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the cost could be the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are less additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the capital : on Bie@@ ber @-@ Expedition in Berlin

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans attended Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ t@@ oria from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .

who cares ?
the fans don &apos;t .
even Bie@@ ber himself did not .
that caused a stir anyway .
for the advertisement in the Super@@ inten@@ dent &apos;s advertising break , he cas@@ c@@ ashed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le company had many , many dollars on the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like it and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also cas@@ hier .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you st@@ unt at the window screen .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e goes too far .
others stress that , after all , Bie@@ ber was just in the US and Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in 1st place .
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA @-@ poster brings Leban@@ ese to Pot@@ ato @-@ twe@@ eter idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
both are in the potato d@@ öner , which the Ol@@ denburg &apos;s burger owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ hay has put potato and meat on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
the idea brought him a poster on a Peg@@ ida demonstrations with the in@@ scription &quot; Pot@@ atoes rather than D@@ öner , &quot; which he acci@@ dentally saw on television .
since then there is a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Leban@@ ese idea has meanwhile arrived at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility model .
that &apos;s why Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to tell how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ e@@ wer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary understanding also goes well with its customers .
met@@ a La@@ un@@ ches Ground Com@@ mit@@ ment Camp@@ aig@@ n to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ come
Met@@ ATM attempts to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground resistance campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , met@@ a and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and shop owners who sell the approved tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ a will publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment conduc@@ ts its annual investment strategy day .
there is much in the game since South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shop stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 per cent in the eastern states .
however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and remove all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million of sales per year and met@@ a 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the amount of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost basis could cost met@@ a around 13 million dollars in profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ a loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent conducted pol@@ l by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most faithful ones .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will drop sales in the food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ a contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenue from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food trading , which is about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction in sales and margins at the same time .
the wholes@@ aler , however , sells and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to compensate for selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths by hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by faster @-@ growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Chief Executive Officer Ian Mor@@ rice states that price adjustments and charging refurb@@ ishment programs are to be put in place and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Federation , Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ and deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , who is always called &quot; special K , &quot; got into the spot@@ light by the not@@ orious confron@@ tation of Cy@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison said : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have beaten Cy@@ gios and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a ra@@ mp@@ f van@@ qu@@ ed a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty brave is the fact that after my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the stri@@ fe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat as he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I believe he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account the important preliminary decision , which ki@@ cks off on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term solid part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe Nick has made a very quick reference to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he goes into the eyes of the public , and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spot@@ light , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .

chaos followed the border , when hundreds of migrants arrested in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted to Ser@@ b officials with indig@@ nation .
the people who had fled from violence were stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ strations rose .
when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants sm@@ ashed &quot; open the border ! &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police police .
some returned from protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrived .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ year @-@ blo@@ c at a controversial meeting in Brussels not to reconc@@ ile common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people seeking refuge in the United Kingdom and Greece . they expressed their hope that - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would take over another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on an early action of Brussels or its neighbours .
the emergency in two southern regions called on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to testi@@ fied that his country plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ail@@ ers were used at the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and became an entry point into the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or damage to the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also lay higher sentences for condemned human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; said Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , which is expected next week , but Rep@@ orters of Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Landes @-@ Security Advisor for Or@@ ban , said authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of committ@@ ing crimes under the new laws .
authorities are trying to fix the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos surro@@ unds the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and press a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to get into it , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to immig@@ rate to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s edge in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey hal@@ ved
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit jump in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is gaining ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers in the primary elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced if he can@@ di@@ fies for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the primar@@ ies .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic vot@@ ers say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey Clinton lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders posted some profits .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
your support with the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is back here with only 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic elec@@ torate less than 50 years has van@@ ished , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a big advantage with the older elec@@ tors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with two @-@ figure promin@@ ence in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic elec@@ tors of the pre @-@ elections nation@@ wide say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would not support six percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly impressed by her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the views are more mixed with those who don &apos;t support Clinton at this time - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while 48 percent of the democratic elec@@ tors of the pre @-@ elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their peak candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman to be president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters have also mentioned their connection to Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and vot@@ ability are also c@@ ited .
as the vice @-@ president has potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the pre @-@ elections want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic constitu@@ ents of the pre @-@ elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the helm .
Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that bi@@ ds would be their second choice far ahead of them .
if Bi@@ den decides not to opt for the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is raised ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic elec@@ tors see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month .
bi@@ ding is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call questions about the vot@@ ability .
similarly as last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this sel@@ ector of primar@@ ies emerged as unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important tra@@ its among vot@@ ers of the primar@@ ies of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den to be honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
among the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts the best in hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of the democratic vot@@ ers do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
democratic constitu@@ ents of the primar@@ ies generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic vot@@ ers have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as Foreign Minister , most Democratic vot@@ ers of the elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions in all .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion has still wor@@ sen@@ ed .
there are mainly Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy by the vot@@ ers of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered vot@@ ers : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 percent of vot@@ ers do not consider them an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time 55 percent of vot@@ ers nation@@ wide see Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump have good grades for guidance .
from the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cuts best in hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many do not think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers in the primary elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves nation@@ wide survey near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
half of the vot@@ ers &apos; support in the new survey now accounts for the two candidates , and others lose dramatically
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nation@@ wide . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the Tuesday &apos;s pol@@ l .
but Car@@ son fired from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes tr@@ ump with rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen to the lowest , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at the third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 individuals of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in the poll@@ s - he lands with 19 % support among the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the dump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking back on a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ques@@ tioning Tr@@ ump &apos;s belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign appearances in Io@@ wa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even when peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing people to find warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go into the sea : the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , divi@@ des the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
on the other hand , bath temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ com@@ er
nearly two years after a student died during a chic ritual of a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an application ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said he was loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly been attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and suppos@@ edly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to apply his symptoms to goo@@ geln and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the National Pres@@ idents of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members of the F@@ ossi@@ ls began to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle about Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said polic@@ eman Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly attached to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s with bl@@ unt force .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the f@@ rat@@ ernity &apos;s ch@@ ic@@ anes . at least one student died from the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a prosecution for the murder of third counts for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for evil attack and formation of a criminal union .
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to be responsible for the people involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or un@@ officially - sanc@@ tioned , we will also be held ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; Wagner commented on a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation with the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest is coming , and the domestic demand is sha@@ ken , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react .
as a result , representatives of the US Central Bank strongly emphasized that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could notice that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to a rise in interest .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock which many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here is a view based on historical trends , how some sectors of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases may make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets yield from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank anal@@ ysts in a recent study on what happened after interest increases in the F@@ ed .
in more detail , the market is in the past 35 years mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate rise , fairly flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then return to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the raising cycle and the margin begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often encourage them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could ha@@ sten a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate rise of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants spent the whole year on an interest increase in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading only has a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all the In@@ cre@@ asing Cy@@ cles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ ö@@ ts have been put in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is quicker than for stocks when they change their strategic course .
in bonds the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the hei@@ ghtening cycle , the loans fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
Charles Schw@@ ab &apos;s strateg@@ ists believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting , says Jones , that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , loan tension has increased and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy .
in large and whole , companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the US will benefit if interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive in the global marketplace , as well as financing their debts .
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react very positively for three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers .
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the mere stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savings could see gains by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s conserv@@ atives critic@@ ised the transmitter for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins interven@@ ed and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading Par@@ liament@@ ary member and raises new pressure on the broad@@ c@@ aster to prove that he does something that the private sender does not do .
the Conserv@@ ative Member , Andrew B@@ ingham , also said to the BBC bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like using the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , starting last year , seem to be just under another name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontane@@ ously named examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC CEO pointed out the alle@@ g@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I &apos;m learning from Radio 3 , I will never learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that truly is uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works is also really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the audience as it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sports came under fire to tre@@ ad the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins interven@@ ed The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often deb@@ ated because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was &quot; on special BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if it was the next time an entertainment series star@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future , or to spend money from fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet turnover slo@@ wed down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online Sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday in November has bra@@ ked the issues
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but experts say there are now indications that online sales stag@@ nate after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stag@@ nate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been evolving over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales index .
he stated that the online sales increased three years ago , when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is sw@@ aying , and we may experience that growth is less@@ ening .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for decl@@ ining sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases prior to this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers hit their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could stop buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium has found out that 5 pounds of spending has been spent on a little more than £ 1 tril@@ lion online .
for some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now done through web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in the crane accident Get@@ öt@@ eten - B@@ in Lad@@ ens family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first bur@@ ial in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partly puts down the collapse of the huge Saudi B@@ in Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
mour@@ ners filled , dressed largely in white , the route in order to clo@@ ak their respect , when the first of the dead came their final journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance ch@@ urch@@ yard .
the funeral proc@@ ession proce@@ eded to the Holy Place where only days before a building crane was rus@@ hed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then to the bed@@ side .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king handed a san@@ ction over the construction company of the B@@ in Laden family because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the bodies of 29 operators who were killed as a crane rus@@ hed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead there was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already promised that the H@@ add@@ ans will go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
king Sal@@ man said today that the B@@ in Laden Group did not have to stop the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the B@@ in Laden Group was co @-@ responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not reveal this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad would be prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man vo@@ wed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which collap@@ sed into an inner courtyard of the great mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were assembled in front of the H@@ add@@ ans who later took place this month .
the B@@ in Laden Group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ apped the group because of the lack of current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the B@@ in Laden Group .
the B@@ in Laden family has been linked to the Saudi dy@@ ke family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the late leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came amid heavy winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the relatives of the killed are to be paid and the same amount of last@@ ingly wounded .
other wounded receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
British employ increasing craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has sur@@ ged
this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at tra@@ des@@ people , are opened
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q outlets will close nation@@ wide
von Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef &apos;s correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Brit@@ ons lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified eastern European tra@@ des@@ people who carry out work in their homes .
if you can sk@@ ill@@ fully handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority today .
because Brit@@ ons increasingly employ arti@@ sans to perform do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers jobs in their houses , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who has the chain hardware chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services to low prices has now been over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renovation than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to shift this more strongly to a balance .
basically half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women listed at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decrease in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the group was at fault for closing the shops .
due to the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the regional court Kl@@ agen@@ furt , two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and dis@@ qualification .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he has been acqu@@ itted of this repro@@ ach in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary examination revealed that the def@@ end@@ ants used money from club accounts in 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated to be about 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial off@@ enses .
this Fak@@ tum retired the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ ens@@ en@@ ats , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
in the absence of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence assumed that the association was at no time an asset .
the sports officials only paid expense compensation and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , the liabilities amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 44.@@ 000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we faced the situation : do we carry on or lock the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread@@ service profession of the finance team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to make any debts .
furthermore , in case of appropriate financial success , the withdrawal of the reimbur@@ sement of expenses was retro@@ active until 1991 .
therefore I have paid off part of the damages only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detailed accounts seemed to appear , the former Ob@@ mann explained the events .
the two def@@ end@@ ants managed the accounts and pass@@ book @-@ books together , said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the pay@@ outs have not been dis@@ closed to the association in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for the financial bon@@ ding , important was only the freedom of debt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the club &apos;s account .
these were appropri@@ ations , the def@@ end@@ ants asser@@ ted .
this securities account ran to the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wher@@ eu@@ pon the respon@@ dent did not know a response for a long time .
then he thought he had believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was form@@ alized as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim repar@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first def@@ end@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent pay , he only paid o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ ets .
he took charge of 1,000 euros per month on di@@ ets , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants could not present accurate records for the early years .
they were no longer kept , after an audit in which everything had been judged as correctly , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ eter money also covered the second def@@ end@@ ant .
all dwell@@ ings were made in cash , for which he had to go to Blei@@ burg from his hom@@ etown to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he declared in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard introduces further 30.000 jobs
in addition to the workforce reduction that has been running for three years , further jobs will be broken down in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up .
the positions at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ fic Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group is planning to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs amoun@@ ting to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will result in a special charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not been completed for three years .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP had some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard share has been 2.3 percent down@@ stream .
the corporation located in Pal@@ o Alto , California , is currently out@@ sourcing : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new company - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock market .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers based on their services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer according to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man re@@ acted late on the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more and more business done online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee a total reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs .

24 per cent oppose intervene in the conflict .
in collaboration with the Syrian ruler Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents refuse to be 20 percent .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : erup@@ tion of violence at Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water laun@@ chers against several hundred displac@@ ed refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the erup@@ tion of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees forced the border .
behind the police there was a police line and behind the polic@@ emen a water @-@ thro@@ wer was ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the public officials .
the officials initially used pep@@ per@@ spray .
then the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
as a result , the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn somewhat cau@@ ti@@ ously .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees sl@@ umped into themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the spokes@@ man of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of deciding on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching when the US central bank comes together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed would do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to wait a little longer and the interest rates at the current level will last from 0 to 0.25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero sector and start a process of norm@@ alising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , Chief Executive Officer at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday
death Con@@ vul@@ sion at Delta State University left ap@@ ologies
after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it undo , &quot; stated authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lectur@@ er for Ge@@ ography and Social Science Education at Delta State University , called the emergency number around 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot on someone , and someone killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb said to the staff of the emergency centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but probably won &apos;t be upset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name but he did not give him .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ s , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs@@ â s performance . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb report@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ s also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities announced on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ s was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said that they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends stayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ s had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Pr@@ enti@@ s was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ s worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who was identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ s .
Kno@@ w@@ les said Pr@@ enti@@ s , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les
the police said , Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them he did not go to prison . &quot;
when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway # 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , how his life cl@@ aw is on the university &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save a half billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was to generate an earnings contribution of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , announced the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer a board of directors for the passenger business in the future .
the Euro@@ wings budget airline should be developed as independently as possible .
in the management team headed by Chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the future .
with the new order , Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future .
until now , the organization of the 120 000 employee has been highly complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict with the pilot association cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to be res@@ um@@ ed after the scheduled strike on this Thursday .
this was divided by the union .
the theme of conversations should be the field of retirement for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forecast record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can come as quickly as possible to viable results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between union and airline led to various strikes over the past few months .
in addition to the transi@@ tional provision of the pilots , background is the &quot; Wings &quot; savings concept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it appears that the Lufthansa flights are out@@ sour@@ ced to the Group &apos;s own budget line Euro@@ wings in the fight against competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ turing of his right leg in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left external def@@ ender to cry and finish it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg organ and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy coming to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then this happens .
in the locker room he had a oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ tures then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ metre .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a penalty and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery now starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the UK def@@ ender has an additional incentive to recover until next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer said : &quot; it is a very serious injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a broken leg when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt his opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very serious injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad here . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron likes the Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost mem@@ orized .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a child care provider to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister op@@ ted for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read from my children because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron suppos@@ edly describes the story of the book , instead resur@@ rec@@ ts an abstra@@ ction of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of the need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss was ho@@ stage , and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that wasn &apos;t yet susp@@ icious : the text presented by Cameron reads partially like the summary of the Lor@@ ax Films , which is presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of the need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , is rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ si@@ fying , need@@ ful fu@@ cking On@@ ce @-@ ler , in spite of the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , bu@@ zz@@ ing creature called &quot; that speaks in the name of trees . &quot;
most probably , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s electoral college .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons employees , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ side victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali developed as Sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th succe@@ eds from the England @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that sp@@ itting players are focused on results .
there were no question marks with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , you could have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
hopefully , if he &apos;s hoping for further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t deliver so good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question how much time a test hit gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance now lies in the past .
Alex H@@ ales came in and he is a head@@ man , whom I guess highly .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket@@ eer , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this naturally depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of suggest@@ ing mos@@ ques beside cook , which would perform an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and receive four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a hammer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques perhaps did not have his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred vines and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari arrives in the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited interaction with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there &apos;s no big number of backup sp@@ inning that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen themselves for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England made some clever additions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with this for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Great Britain &apos;s exit from the EU ) could gain supply if the economy went into a fleet until 2017 .
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ finished ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was severely bru@@ ised due to Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at recently said that some member states are so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises such as the EU is now and not always of its own fault , Britain itself created agenda with split enc@@ ro@@ achments and disrup@@ tive contractual changes , which they usually do not wish to satisfy .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Self@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on sum@@ mits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local memorial , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes an outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point in some capitals , in which they do not care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has happened in the exagger@@ ated long @-@ to @-@ endure like th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande is looking back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will break a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most of them have similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies .
therefore , some such ministers may inten@@ tionally not plan useful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a p@@ light &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they may remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 1990s .
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed knew Mili@@ band who were his enemies .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing ch@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers and pseu@@ do @-@ non @-@ nationals , most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar to her , but found that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself , when he opposed Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the non @-@ passed Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , thus opening a backdoor .
the press never missed him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly tap on his back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the eigh@@ ties , a mistake back then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ Sofa he left on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it in a friendly way - in the development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blu@@ b@@ ber@@ ant tendency and the wild Gef@@ il@@ den of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not Benn@@ ink &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the prov@@ oking John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as shadow law was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and MPs after all reports on their statement on Monday evening .
whatever the stir@@ ring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe allowing him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for granted , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities regarding EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite si@@ ege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities regarding Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they too have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a donation from the T@@ ory government in power , which was reminded on Monday by something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) concluded by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Fund@@ amental Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extremely win@@ dy basis &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers are writing in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are &quot; based on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects the claim that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ criteri@@ on Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing directors had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BAT ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BAT on Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained how to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding that he was supposed to have received according to reports previously by the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not provided , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also include an industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in the tobacco control .
at the meeting also took part in the tobacco management of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ge@@ ographi@@ cally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harsh proof@@ s of most products with most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers were premature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims were already re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addi@@ ction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves , and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative danger related to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease involving smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by the clear arrangement of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ers , says former Head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ers and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should be used only to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making publicly @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in harsh controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or broadcast , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson dem Ober@@ haus Communications Committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC .
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t think in the medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least put his production on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funding programmes that could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give her right arm .
I &apos;m trying to see how this public @-@ right television is supposed to be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts announce that the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ ers .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they fulfill their tasks and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion R@@ uns , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the committee on the radio charge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value of this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , all of us think we are all thinking that one has a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , I wonder if this is true because they do not consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also declared in front of the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check its Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate , and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example on the TV channels in Australia and Canada , for example to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
to the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of TV will be shown , and with the commercial channels alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction at the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear .
the pul@@ ses function by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ asonic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new method , called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , Res@@ ear@@ cher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the process of a day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure which releases electrical impulses in the brain of people for the treatment of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread@@ worms generally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microsc@@ opic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultrasound waves which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asonic @-@ controlled nem@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when using ultrasound on the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with light impulses .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be sent down to the desired location in the brain by optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

V@@ C@@ CP &apos;s Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prev@@ ailed around the advertising for the arms trade - through a void of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ ous company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains stronger by bl@@ aming with bright colours and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the trade fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally on our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair dates back to the field within Excel , where exhibitors are scra@@ m@@ bling fantastic eu@@ ph@@ emis@@ tically products .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student halls ranges from easy ner@@ ving up to absolutely horri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to say : people tell where you come from , and where you took sab@@ bath year , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither loved nor hate because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk to , even if your las@@ hes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave .
people often turn into beverage recipes , film night venues and municipal meeting places , but they are also places where people wear and dress up their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at university
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
her room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted - and send him a text message instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos anch@@ oring : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friend@@ ships close by baking .
since you start the university at the height of the Back @-@ Man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked them something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people falling asleep when you click .
steal food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea too ?
check with the dairy owner .
the chances are good that they say to themselves , even when cooking inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , that &apos;s anno@@ ying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a dish@@ washing agent to her milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse in the tru@@ est sense of what you are saying .
a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbours if it makes them something to make Drum &amp; Bass a bit qui@@ eter than it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly allowed their neighbors to sleep for two hours before leaving their own music , closing their door and closing their three @-@ hour test .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you &apos;re holding a room@@ mate for your future spouse , going to her , divor@@ ce herself and seeing her every day and perhaps seeing how she draws together all common friends .
of course , the heart goes your own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good st@@ ump is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
replace a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security by hiding - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
lock your door and place your keys in a glass of water that will put you in the freezer - but stap@@ le their pos@@ sessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ pull , low @-@ income
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds semi @-@ detached houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing space but also the only educ@@ ative mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ thi@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I show you how to build cheap and cheap today , &quot; says the 44 year old in the interview
thousands of refugees are being pushed to the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : it builds in a project row houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , a lot of refugees are being pushed to the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people are staying here for a great part .
given the refugee flow , we also need sufficient living space over the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different when people are taught in living blocks .
each of the six homes , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; without land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
do the building instructions have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I went through my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the imp@@ ending Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the placement placement arrangement .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
there is still a question of who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the local residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which definitely is not right .
but don &apos;t you ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true that we had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but we have built luxury apartments that hardly can afford more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only refugees but also the only educ@@ ative mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ thi@@ ener .
I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and cheap today .
that is what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then to install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message that tells us that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by adding the update . similarly , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to make sure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a char@@ gers , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may switch on half way and this could lead to break@@ down@@ s .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has joined another member in its ranks , so the number of members increased to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul Gau@@ sel@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to the K@@ ur .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and hon@@ orary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen supported Gau@@ sel@@ mann with a donation which accepted Chairman Alfred Klein .
it is therefore possible to include chess players who cannot afford membership fee .
youth work and talent research are also to be pushed forward .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann wants membership in the chess club and also friendly contacts to the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; as an expression of its connection with the spa town .
district office is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the elderly care center Anton@@ isti@@ ft joined forces under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new office at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
besides consult@@ ations , you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the inner city .
more precisely , the Count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and couns@@ ell@@ ors receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of the health and nursing inf@@ ants .
for years , we have been using our out@@ patient care service to ensure that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions here .
&quot; many of the services of the insurance companies are not often claimed , because the complexity of the insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the care of the elderly , the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Ci@@ tizen &apos;s Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus . &quot;
in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to do this , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken with the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis supplement ideally .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Heike R@@ ie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business leaders are seeing the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in demographic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the club meeting at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular convi@@ vial presence . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution that elderly people can live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 .

witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 p.m. , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the site of the gas station .
one of these men cried out to the young people and hit the face with their f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ leg and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff , he first left his sacrifice .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car to the apartment and passed several times there .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male member .
with the help of a bat@@ ard , one exam@@ ines on the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of the field and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ aus@@ sburg .
also the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased .
in many places in the country doctors - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , are missing : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice rock breaks on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ aus@@ er is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his side in the coming months .
after a conversion phase Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first glance when Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l met who are currently completing their medical training at the Ver@@ den hospital and who also wants to enter into practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ cher@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was ready , I just called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of operating their own practice in As@@ endorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own boss soon .
and so one agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed head doctor in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is engaged in hon@@ orary capacity in the DRC @-@ willingness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) speci@@ alis@@ es in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ aus@@ ausen .
the tr@@ ash cans , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practi@@ tioner .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a consulting room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely re@@ done .
as part of a funding programme from the county ( 25,000 euros ) and the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) , the refuse collection will receive a total of 50,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that practice continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses Sam@@ t@@ communal mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come into practice in the field of rock breaks , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another medical practice .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen , the pharmacy remains in As@@ endorf .
if no successor had found himself , it would have gone .
those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s consult@@ ations , by the way , continue to look especially in familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the rock @-@ standing aus@@ ens .
with their f@@ arewell there is an era in As@@ endorf , after all , the medicine has practiced for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ aus@@ ausen rec@@ alls .
after a long period of time , a little sad@@ ness can be felt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband is laugh@@ ing : &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gar@@ dening , now it could become different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border checks are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said interior minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to make a request for asylum must also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the focus is on the supply and security of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there needs to be clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited mig@@ rat@@ ory flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously indicated that Slovenia wanted to continue traveling in the direction of Austria and Germany and also er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - above all to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to overcome its borders for refugees but not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night @-@ hours to Tuesday in order to avoid registration in East Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik perpet@@ u@@ ates police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country , with some 4000 refugees , will be credited , said the Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo would be transferred to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously taken migrants to the Hungarian border , to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was for people to approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we nor do we do this , &quot; it said .
according to media reports , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived at the border town Si@@ d in the morning , in the course of the day , additional buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian boar@@ der of the Mac@@ ed@@ onian boar@@ der which was about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
with this , it could actually come to a somewhat further west @-@ situated route to the postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out rig@@ orous checks to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently testi@@ fied to the country as regards the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees continue to hide behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the remaining refugees will now want to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down Wednesday at a local note in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on Alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
it would not at present be about very high refugee figures .
one could not say whether they would continue their trip through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - Alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already started distribut@@ ing maps to the refugees on which alternative routes have been marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a mine clearance team was sent to the border region .
stock exchange h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians numbers 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who has been accused of having gained insight into yet un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites like Business Wire , Market@@ Place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the collected information , insi@@ der businesses should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than 100 million dollars were found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other wor@@ sen@@ ed in the case continued .
most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rators are to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid Mannheim exists for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mann@@ heimer par@@ ade@@ platz .
the people do their err@@ ands , sometimes fast pac@@ ing , partly cozy bum@@ bling .
you control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
holding town tracks .
puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with splendid autumn sun and in the midst of four large tables each with the heading &quot; Before I die ... &quot; ....
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy immediately attracted attention to its 20 @-@ year existence and is confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks as the volunteers .
while a pass@@ ant spontane@@ ously attacks the chal@@ k and the phrase &quot; my life affir@@ ms , &quot; &quot; can &quot; read , &quot; &quot; with the camper by the USA , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again there are little discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; only if I make it clear to me that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live ir@@ responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Mannheim plant in Mannheim , together with the Car@@ it@@ asmus Association , the carrier of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy .
therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tablets is understandable , but after all it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and death is still subject to tab@@ oos , as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed a great deal to the opening of people .
an estim@@ ation that Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the funeral and mour@@ ning atten@@ d@@ ant belongs to the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted with personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was looking for volunteers by calling volunteers , she immediately reported herself and was there when she was founded in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can deal with her job and experience and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations allows the training and further training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning atten@@ d@@ ants .
training courses for new employees are offered every two years .
the tablets described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protest@@ ant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
there are also other personal wishes written on postcards .
Fed@@ Ex results mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its bo@@ at@@ hau@@ l service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers on holiday .
at that time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous predi@@ ction .
anal@@ ysts expected , according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
despite the increase in price increases , the lower prospect will be 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ sourcing of heavy and large packages that are raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company yields &quot; solid yields if you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , Fed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve anal@@ ysts at T@@ ack Investment Research .
sales rose 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
analy@@ st &apos;s six anal@@ ysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has posted a decline in international priority shipping , which caused sales to stag@@ nate in its unit express shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express Unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result sank due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in pre @-@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week sitting around a 27 foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the lead for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States lies above them at an end of the en@@ chan@@ ted , two @-@ story cour@@ t@@ room .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : keeping U.S. occup@@ ations and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by unprecedented incentives by the short @-@ term interest rate at the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it is growing solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ously increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they can observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is uns@@ ett@@ ling the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rise in interest rate this week .
however , the financial markets wait for the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance for an increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , D@@ ow Jones Industrial aver@@ aged 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 points .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest increase would so@@ ot@@ he financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty as to when the F@@ ed would act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow sharpen@@ ing of monetary conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer that this year , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als , it would have required more economic progress , an increase in the sentence .
although job creation slo@@ wed down in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed considers as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and need it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world sent together at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors were afraid that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth .
the market has recovered a little this month , with the D@@ ow now almost 10 % below the end of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when one should raise interest rates .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve .
now he predi@@ cts that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved in its decision making .
but in the end it has become the F@@ ed Monetary Authority of the World .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
the mere reference of the director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could narrow its monetary expansion , conf@@ lic@@ ted confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , F@@ ed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also advise other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements that apparently are not linked to the economic fundament@@ als data . &quot;
lack@@ er , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates interest in interest , c@@ ited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able impacts on growth in the United States , &quot; Lack@@ er said .
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives removed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only in the first place during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , said Adam S. Poz@@ nan , former member of the Com@@ mitt@@ ees for the Bank of England .
the most recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest because markets are upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small assistance to refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany for these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the dedication of countless volunteers .
there are also a number of people in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes teaching with her 74 lessons .

it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , the whole thing is different than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization , Spr@@ S , is trying to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking way about how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that su@@ ck breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research indicates that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der sports hall
the Municipal Council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymnas@@ tics hall at the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports complex is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal council meeting , the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously approved without any major discussions .
the committee had previously decided to apply a &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from a valid development plan , among other things , an application for an &quot; amend@@ ment to the building legal &quot; exception &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; exemp@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we went for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ centered first and roof top &quot; is to be constructed .
background of planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; this is how we get together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
in the case of &quot; Liber@@ ation , &quot; again , it was about the a@@ version of the roof , which for energetic reasons - is stipul@@ ated differently than in the development plan - should be below ten degrees .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary , because the development plan in respect of the a@@ version of the roof does not allow &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Public Council generally mis@@ ses restri@@ ct@@ edly in the case of moti@@ ons .
however , it is not a recur@@ ring project in the case of a gymn@@ asi@@ um : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the sports centre is a joint project of the community and the SV Bern@@ ried .
at the cost , some 2.3 million euros have been calculated .
subsidies are expected from school and mass transportation .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now submitted to the Land council office .
Klinik Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is what the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the district , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted .
however , a decision on this will be met by the Supervisory Board , and it will take place next Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans are to be implemented , then all the nearly 50 employees will continue working at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing internal station .
the rooms are available .
the employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees were informed of the plans .
Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Hospital since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fis@@ her@@ man &quot; came into play in the question who agreed to take the lead on 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this was in every case an &quot; appreciation &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the field of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the In@@ ner Station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
over the next two years , fishermen with his team will have to lead both houses until next year , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ el , which still has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district has planned this for 2018 if the currently ongoing renovation work at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ ur@@ schaft , is to be used as shelter for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß has failed to say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day@@ esp@@ iratory system are accommod@@ ated there .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; says Fischer on the quasi rel@@ ocation to the Le@@ ch , which has been &quot; positive and very understandable &quot; by the employees .
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened with closure over the past few decades , det@@ achments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the lob@@ b@@ als of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ isches Institut .
although the league leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce .
in the past season , the Bad@@ ener related to the B@@ HC a painful defeat and have granted something there .
Jag@@ ev@@ el with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest in the afternoon by shots .
during the aber@@ ration on a ma@@ ize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in action , as the police informed .
after a shooting , a 63@@ - and 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were put into hospitals .
how exactly it could have happened to the accident was un@@ clear at first .

missing 16 @-@ year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds who have been missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate missing for Saturday has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , including the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and the police on Wednesday .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , was also suspected of acting as an active agent and the investig@@ ators found the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after they had not come home after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of the evening .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of inter@@ rog@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old has finally shown himself .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities reported to the authorities that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the cor@@ pse was put into the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port hop@@ per on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators lay down the charges against him .
the investigation of the immediate circumstances should bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees seek a paid stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
distribution competitions on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the arriving refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the Association of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
a total of 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , Refu@@ ge@@ es are no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first emergency accommodation .
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the rented flats .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is pushing a housing deficit that will grow from year to year .
currently some 77@@ 0,000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ ol@@ itan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professional people therefore lived in large cities not@@ with@@ standing in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ will@@ ingly longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; due to the floo@@ ding of the housing market .
in the big cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a has fallen for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction again .
this could be wai@@ ved for the real estate tax and the property tax for subsi@@ dised flats is subject to limited time .
in addition , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation facilities are necessary according to the Alliance .
the subsi@@ dy programme for the German state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the launch , more than half of the available € 300 million was already rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be stopped .
refugees have a free time : Croatia and Slovenia direct a cor@@ ridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no escape to Hungary anymore , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian minister of the Interior , and if necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to escape from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , report the Croatian television station RTL .
Hungary had closed off its border for refugees the day before .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , practically unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic announced : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police launched the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in the morning .
according to media reports , most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as with ta@@ xis to the Serbian border town Si@@ d .
immediately upon arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
at the border of the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across the border fence .
for this the border stri@@ pe has other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ ers should now quickly create a secure passage .
after Hungary , there are hardly any more refugees after the border is closed .
on Tuesday , the police counted 36@@ 6 attacked people .
shortly before the closure on Monday there were 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the overcoming and damage of the border region as a criminal off@@ ence .
in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
the sentences threatened with sentences of up to five years and dep@@ ortation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ ons , &quot; of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning there had been 40 refugees .
practically no one has any more prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be dep@@ orted there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up .
they collected the rub@@ b@@ ish that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barrier nets were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border area was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , only a few refugees reach Austria after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country has also strengthened its border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but about 20,000 migrants still remained in the country after government declar@@ ations .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instructions of German authorities .
smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot in Frei@@ lass@@ ing .
mayor ro@@ de &quot; ge@@ str@@ and@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; after the Brü@@ cken@@ fest on Sunday we were busy with the clean up when suddenly ten people with travel flash@@ ers stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had surprisingly stopped the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and saw the border together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before that , we first introduced the unexpected guests , with snack and drinks .
we said right away , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; it was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; we were very happy , &quot; Stad@@ ler said .
the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE to Pass@@ au on Sunday evening in W@@ els , after the short notice that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try the border .
the regional train was stopped at the inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , cross @-@ border crossing is generally high .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest linked with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , Sunday before a two @-@ bridge run sporting - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more Z@@ ig@@ nia to us is a logical result of an apparent policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately in construc@@ ting structures that ensure humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has both formally and publicly en@@ chan@@ ted the attitude of the Hungarian government to the ha@@ ze of National Soci@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Blessed Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who invited them and welcomed them is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flood of refugees and the coming winter , to create decent conditions for def@@ ensi@@ tive people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad in search of 3@@ 5,000 winter @-@ resistant quartz
Konrad used to do all his hands with the support of the refugee .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos at the first Tak@@ eover Centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already taken hold of Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the accommodation of the 20.000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without big whir@@ l@@ winds , Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke about a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quar@@ ks in the last year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 units have to be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 should provide the countries , 15.000 to the federal government .
should there be more refugees we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a drum without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he already had conversations with the cent@@ uri@@ ons .
they would have assured him to create quarters for the next refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s good , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordin@@ ator also sets great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help us as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private individuals can easily arrange accommodation .
in addition , there are hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that district providers have to comply with a certain amount of the hand towel holder or the size of the surface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he was more successful in placing him in the accommodation department , Con@@ rad came up with his experience .
I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further in the face the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er don &apos;t inc@@ ur the Republic as they declared .
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
its own quest for qu@@ arti@@ s has not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to put a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
first no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ arena and design center for accommodation of refugees plans the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as it is possible to accommodate those affected without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of an emergency , however , further locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability .
the city chief critic@@ ises the distribution of refugees in the federal state .
other districts must also make a contribution here .
Seeh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) , on Monday , ac@@ counted for further action in the refugee issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German borders will not be sealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
however , the investig@@ ators would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
the general renovation of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in Linz &apos;s industrial line is officially closed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is set up , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later to acquire some of them .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some things : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested in the facility by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meter space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
in fact , Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to set up a dog .
this project had to push the 49 year old bear@@ er of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market arc@@ ades : after all , she has got an increase in the form of another business local .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , all about women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have thought for a long time whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Gre@@ ater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been put in the cra@@ dle by her mother .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the professional woman cannot answer with the last certainty .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag of every outfit is upgraded .
the Green@@ wich Jesu@@ it from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called An@@ ders .
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ enses .
whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself in a foreign @-@ hostile manner , concerns journalists or gaps in knowledge in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. Pres@@ idency of the Congress bu@@ zz@@ es the election campaign strongly .
and cuts down well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate bubble are coming from .
the New Yorker with the fo@@ eh@@ l@@ ore @-@ hair@@ style is a concept many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine @-@ road .
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is related to it over -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather escaped from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous sho@@ ots , including the k@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz alongside Tr@@ ump .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) as well - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is already a bit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - zu Hoch@@ deutsch : the gi@@ ver , says it .
tr@@ ump comes from the village of investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
foundation stone of the real estate group was first real estate in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their home in the long run failed on the Bavarian state , which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because once he was cut off without permission , the Director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken out about Mexican immigrants in the USA and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to fri@@ ghten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as he pol@@ ishes , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born &quot; Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks rather dist@@ anced to the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so bri@@ d@@ geable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ stadt comments that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family during a visit ended something for the church organ , which generally arrived well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you find it better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the Sa@@ as at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have been there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for whom Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 movie singers , also in the USA the interest is awakening .
the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first mountain climbing village .
from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain villages . &quot;
in neighbouring countries , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; must have a maximum of 2,500 residents .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts on Today &apos;s reviews .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull abol@@ ished the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this dis@@ advantage of the revol@@ t seemed to play no part for Australian TV spectators since Sun@@ rise scored an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five major cities compared to today 33@@ 9,@@ 000 .
today , today announced a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number lag@@ ged behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months .
in August Today today reached 3@@ 18.@@ 000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance was between 40.000 and 50.000 .
so far in September Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ 9,@@ 000 spectators at 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could perform a hit show solo without Raf@@ ter &apos;s star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 83@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , showed an average of 44@@ 6,000 people .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13,@@ 000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour conden@@ sed 7@@ 20,000 .
average Hot @-@ Seat average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot seat will ultimately en@@ force at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute which failed to run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire show .

the last three match : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret Rev@@ e@@ aled ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly apparent who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was wrapped in great sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up if she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before being out of three , you might have acci@@ dentally added a hint to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed to the final on Thursday
all three women have wonder@@ ed in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and , in doing so , called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should keep W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; could their answers become a game @-@ destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors .
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly named themselves - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
from the very first day , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and re@@ marked ( Sarah ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth at both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be suitable as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit of the house made her clear last week that Wood could be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood to choose , if not her , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor &apos;s degree is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a tie as the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League convert with his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also publicly strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his cat@@ ched catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ rons in a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings .
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a thing that happens now , you just care about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut back then in 2007 when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

because of the high refugee numbers , Free vot@@ ers demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party and fac@@ tional leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a severe crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn retreat in Groß@@ glo@@ stadt . &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land Parliament faction of the Free Movement dar@@ es to Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now domin@@ ating the free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lay the exam , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as in the 1990 &quot; s during the Yugoslavia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free @-@ vot@@ er chief . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one free vot@@ ers as quickly as possible .
that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also called for more personnel for administrative dishes that are responsible for asylum procedures : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum in@@ judges , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the father@@ land should not fall under the table in Gross@@ wall@@ stadt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a long @-@ term issue remains on the agenda : education policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Medium Press plus , &quot; which will be tested for three to four years with an extension of the high school secondary school .
but that &apos;s not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be spe@@ eded up , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all high schools who want to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax to jumps
the German stock market is closed with profits over a long line of trend @-@ free and nervous trade history .
only in the afternoon was a strong start of the US stock exchanges for a clear direction that ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points .
the M@@ DA@@ X of medium @-@ sized values won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .
the technology @-@ elastic Tec@@ D@@ ax rose by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 36.@@ 69 points .
the Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 as the monetary index of the euro@@ zone decreased by 1.@@ 01 percent to 320@@ 7,@@ 60 points .
the trading places in London and Paris also recorded solid gains .
in the United States , the D@@ ow Jones Index last noted around 1 percent in plus .
many stock markets therefore expect the markets to be on the spot until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for a large decline in the fut@@ ures trading on this Friday .
the discussion about the bur@@ dens from the nuclear phase has pushed the shares of R@@ WE in the meantime to a record low and also left its mark on E@@ on .
according to &quot; Spiegel &quot; the German energy companies might be missing 30 billion euros in provisions .
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( R@@ WE ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares rose by a further 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax peak .
according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor &apos;s magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; took effect from the weekend .
accordingly , investors gave too little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
investments in promising w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August more cars were sold more than in the same period last year , as the AC@@ EA industry association announced at the start of the International Motor Show I@@ AA in Frankfurt .
Daimler and BMW &apos;s papers increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen benefits increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
the return on the German pension market fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.50 ) percent .
the pension index Rex rose by 0.0 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the federal future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4,@@ 11 points .
the price of the euro decreased in the afternoon to 1.@@ 12@@ 62 USD .
around noon the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to USD 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) .
the dollar thus cost 0,@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0,@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros .
killed 4 people after police bul@@ lets shoot at demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 year old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police shot down rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that prot@@ ested against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ zw@@ a , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , throwing some of you stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before they got back on rubber floors .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used blank@@ ets , known to be able to kill , but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern pl@@ ains , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ HL@@ i say that new provinces which are formed under the proposed new constitution would dimin@@ ish their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent cl@@ ashes since 10 .
killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been ruled by centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers ha@@ sten@@ ed the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the land at the Em@@ de Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre surface .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market a plot of approximately 4000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the youth centre of Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
wait for corresponding offers , that is to say on the part of the city .
the investor in@@ quired is not yet clear .
no contracts have been signed accordingly .
the town of Em@@ den had already bought a part of the property located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Street , already a few months ago , and the building had to be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for an agriturismo on the Small Sea near Em@@ den are taking shape .
the investor gave public plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ li@@ eger are further troubled - they fear the sale of their free @-@ time certificate
months @-@ long behind closed doors were negoti@@ ated , gro@@ unded , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday resort on the little sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ de company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ de Council .
originally , this point was on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which submitted sec@@ rec@@ y to the investor and the administration , Ralf Behr@@ ends went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered any questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and over 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours .
the project , which is about ten to twelve million euros , has been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among marine land@@ owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ horse owner and member of the board of interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this becomes a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like some other project critics , that the traffic through the intended size of the system would increase sharply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus inv@@ itations will come to be reck@@ oned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what is exactly on the good one h@@ ect@@ are large area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the construction plans were still variable .

the U.S. National Hurri@@ cane Centre announced on Tuesday a broad low @-@ pressure system about 350 miles ( 560 km ) south of the sou@@ ther@@ n@@ most Kap@@ ver@@ dischen islands , which has a 60 percent chance to develop into a tropical cycl@@ one in the next 48 hours .
another clearly defined low pressure system in the middle between the Cape Verde islands and the Kleine Anti@@ ll@@ es also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cycl@@ one in the next two days , added the weather experts station@@ ed in Miami .
Google starts dou@@ bling @-@ donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ raising campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ run the European nations , as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation request on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who fled Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / territory could be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for easily over@@ weight diab@@ etics weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial on the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric tu@@ bing - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I among those under@@ going this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical type of diabetes roughly equal to 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition was totally dis@@ integrated and 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes , only one percent and only about two percent were achieved .
in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol , &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood levels of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , writes the researchers .
after surgery the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also toler@@ ated average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit over five years , there are indications of a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was with obes@@ e people who under@@ went obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conven@@ tionally .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story takes place in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is increasingly paying attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary memorial to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide sum@@ mon@@ ed the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10 @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also emphasized that the reaction of the West European countries ad@@ mira@@ bly ad@@ mira@@ bly to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you must think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , primarily through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reduce the use of force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 , pointing out that the violent reaction of the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in ing@@ es@@ tion of hand san@@ iti@@ zer by children over the last 4 years
po@@ ison@@ ous control centers in the US report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years that swal@@ low a lot of alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the po@@ ison@@ ous control centers , rose from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children increasingly come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children inten@@ tionally drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test in social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers can drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents are said to have mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing to children .
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few spra@@ yers can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation especially in inf@@ ants .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t let si@@ p around whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sp@@ las@@ hes from after straw@@ berry frag@@ rant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants at school , was put into an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold which is legally considered dr@@ unken by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency medical doctor , who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors guar@@ ded them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had pushed her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ ner Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol pois@@ oning , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were linked to deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario following the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as a substance .
in January , three students from the fourth grade were planning to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the failed scheme as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ atter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action against the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is bor@@ ed - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they don &apos;t show any highlights of the Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of Rang@@ ers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of tension in the old @-@ fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will turn around things , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Cel@@ tic has to fight , but the Norwegian leader s@@ wore to turn things around .
after defeat against Malm@@ ö and the following withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , now with five points ahead of the table , followed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that just like that - but we have to go on .
we really need to really support Cel@@ tic because that makes the player better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ tious at January @-@ transfer

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season period to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in cups or lions which have not won games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is growing altogether .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labour for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the 5.5 percent share of the U@@ Ks , as the numbers of the Bureau of National Statisti@@ cs ( ONS ) showed .
meanwhile employment in Scotland fell 12,@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,@@ 000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have witnessed further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I witness an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it happens , and I hope it won &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison@@ ous injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses during his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications available than seats , a ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p &apos;s close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma acc@@ uses me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it , and you will get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted she could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to be present to write .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty will help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying of unnecessary death .
man after a mo@@ ist police chase is persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the C@@ anning River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang down the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape from them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
a soccer player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to contribute to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins Bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy says ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobal@@ t sw@@ ab sample at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
he held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alle@@ g@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ strated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to walk around the head , and I want my owners to think I &apos;m trying my best for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer anymore .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
prior to that Moo@@ dy had to leave the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity section had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they apparently believe that I am a fraud .
if this is the case , they should certainly believe in their nos@@ es , because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should this take me to believe that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave co@@ war@@ dly and does people outside of trainers make responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and exp@@ el me , and I have no doubt that what I say they are thinking about .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I am now at the point where I don &apos;t care about it , and that makes me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will exercise pressure on them and urge them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ strations level of the trainer set up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he could &quot; throw &quot; his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black Caviar , described the race treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack had been applied mud or clay on the horse debate , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so last night .
it could have been the same yesterday all day , which was so .
but it was also the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the day of the race . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda setting &quot; by two premi@@ er League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the storm players &quot; ring fighting &quot; with his team during the high storm win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos instructor Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a barely disgu@@ sting note to the Storm team after his team reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the rug@@ by league and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good &quot; in rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the stap@@ le of his team and said they were concent@@ rating only on their &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team was confident that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always shows up - I have not heard Tr@@ ent Robinson compl@@ aining about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; struggles when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything about our def@@ ensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and obviously he has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him .
it is funny how this appears again and again at this time of year .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and his ment@@ or reminds Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons who won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in the year 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of soccer games - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
the play of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses doing and not points something exciting ?
for me , it is the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the storm team is free on this weekend as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Serbia with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ eed after Dru@@ gs
a man who might have a life @-@ long penalty due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine that was sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and put in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the late afternoon and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that could have been a harmless reason in the café .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape in Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stated on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the ei@@ des@@ si@@ bly declar@@ ations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of $ 200,000 is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jud@@ ge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Ser@@ b Pass , regi@@ sters every day with the police and ad@@ heres to a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : cab tears apart
on Tuesday evening , a truck driver was seriously injured in a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police informed .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ caused car tore apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage amoun@@ ting to 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile to send images
a ped@@ oph@@ ile used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when he slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of un@@ warran@@ ted pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl later wo@@ ke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping bun@@ ny .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms for the search for in@@ consistent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet &quot; and he then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addi@@ ction - that he is ad@@ dic@@ ted to sc@@ are people .
he admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked about his interview with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did to l@@ ure her .
he said he was ill in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she also saw the moti@@ on@@ less pictures on the telephone and con@@ front the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment to have in@@ crimin@@ ated images of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions on January 25 of this year and not to appear before court at a hearing on March 24 of this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g would not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , argu@@ ing that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; can be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael took the judgement until October to obtain background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted b@@ ail in this case but was held in rem@@ and for hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the judgment .
Schle@@ user switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up on the German @-@ Austrian border off the main control points .
many Schle@@ users left people increasingly on smaller border cross@@ ings from fear of discovery and arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday along the border river Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and shr@@ ubs to the German side .
there they will be received from the Federal Police officer and for@@ warded to the registration .
in the Munich Hauptbahnhof ( Central Station ) , more refugees arrived on Wednesday again compared to the week @-@ beginning on Wednesday .
approximately 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8.00 am , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : stream@@ lining of Henry &quot; tropical storm awaiting the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of stor@@ m@@ alle@@ ys in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low @-@ pressure area across Western Europe , warm sea air is currently in the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart announced .
the vigor@@ ous deep is the prec@@ urs@@ or of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who was pulled over the Atlantic over the last few days from the Bermuda Islands .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to the D@@ WD still to be reck@@ oned up in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Con@@ stance District with bu@@ cks of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a long time .
the mass makes it : every two years , the free@@ zers at the I@@ AA show their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , first and foremost , movement in the compact cars is to be recorded , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in high demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new regi@@ strations were ac@@ counted for by the Federal District Office ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is reflected in the I@@ AA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German auto industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at dealers in the fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
R@@ üssel@@ sheim . Opel is launching an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is priced at EUR 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is initially only available as a five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which can be seen at the I@@ AA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the Frankfurt Motor Show ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault announces the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and spor@@ tier GT version .
in the trade he comes in the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan representative wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti is fully integrated into the brand &apos;s design line with its curved lines .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 b@@ hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications of 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not entirely new , but completely re@@ done is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the I@@ AA .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers put in front of all hand at the front end : here the radiator gr@@ ille was newly drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , especially the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
at the I@@ AA in the compact class , a range of re@@ visions and new variants such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 GT@@ I have been added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human @-@ worthy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Constitutional Court ordered an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the prison guards &quot; Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their dignity , in@@ mates are princip@@ ally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in too small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court on a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judge , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer &apos;s instructions , was now on the open foot , was transferred to a larger cell .
he failed because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin .
however , the Constitutional Jud@@ ges raised the verdi@@ ct of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case to re @-@ examine it .
they see the human dignity of the man hurt .
Kammer@@ gericht will now decide on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of detention for compensation were decisive , a statement of compensation was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear a weak@@ ening of the legal protection of the personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of App@@ eal must now clarify the amount of money in@@ dem@@ ni@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus they only spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was locked up naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without a separate toilet .
on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had att@@ ested to a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated daily between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the pris@@ ons in Berlin had hit the head@@ lines in recent weeks due to missing personnel .
prisoners are therefore locked up again and again for 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness goes up , even dro@@ w@@ sin@@ es have already occurred due to the ten@@ se situation .
according to the judicial authorities , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of offspring , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the migration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) Germany , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will be able to accept a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated commitment in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 35@@ 0,000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed yearly - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the shortage of living space , however , is dramatically changed : every year , 600@@ 00 bis 800@@ 00 social housing units come out of the rental price bond , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister for Agriculture Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
a lot too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing would have to be produced annually , and the federal government would have to invest a total of 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scientists and federal mini@@ stri@@ es agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the poultry can be employed in Germany in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany wouldn &apos;t be systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , she critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is vital if they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ ration@@ ologist Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ ot@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise labour .
whereas previously there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation , which limits asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society , as a result of the shortage of skilled labour , the majority of people have hol@@ is@@ tically asser@@ ted that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster .
a major barrier to access to the labour market is lacking knowledge of German .
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and job @-@ related language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often communicated by personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore , according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the Royal Road to the integration of labour .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few forced parents give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the parents ro@@ oting it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for teachers increase dramatically due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase vocational training capacity by allowing more vocational schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for lessons in the welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ollen from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle no federal state seek@@ ers asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception has been Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
study willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
for refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ ce do not receive benefits after the asylum seek@@ er performance law more if they start studying .
the latter generally do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ög@@ legitimate persons .
patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g entitled , from January 1 , 2016 , this span short@@ ens to 15 months .
but this financing gap has to be closed , but also calls for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely grant the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state churches rights continue to evolve into a new state religion relationship .
it is also important to establish an Islamic well @-@ being federation , who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers professionally .
duties also belong to the rights .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him some control options .
this also includes the willingness to act in opposition to religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
those who wanted to impose such conflicts in Germany &quot; immediately got their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law on Arabic .
in the future , integration will be much more than today an issue of the whole society .
as a result , the majority society will also have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more pressing .
indeed , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since a decade ago .
but it slowly lear@@ ns how the NSU record series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organisations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white German have long for and what international agreements , such as anti @-@ ra@@ cial hatred , commit to Germany , must become a reality in the coming years , if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of its opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for MAN@@ - Power and capacities , we manage it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls on all the new@@ com@@ ers to hand out health cards right away .
achievements could later be settled with the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to send as many people with the limited performance catalogue that the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees .
apart from that , the doctors make especially the language barriers to be created .
so far , Berlin &apos;s health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting worse about their illnesses than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ters must be taken over , they demand .
many refugees were also helped with more general medical procedures in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more untreated obstacles , and with the young people there is HIV raising .
with the partly other disease pictures German doctors are coming from their training but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ asi@@ tism or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the health care professional may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have developed a highly developed education system , and several refugees were even doctors .
in order to practice , however , they need to prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates by the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent study by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ages of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart racing and death @-@ fear .
other symptoms are sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have a psych@@ otherapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers in the social workers may request a psych@@ otherapy application , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social quarters , non@@ skilled workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts .
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal trained and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites into the man@@ ege on the brick @-@ was@@ en for dre@@ aming .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current stage production .
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift to am@@ a@@ ze is thus in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away people from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man cocktail with international flair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilomet@@ re long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the Cir@@ cus convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov Clo@@ wn Family captiv@@ ates the audience with w@@ it and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cub@@ an duo wants to pick up the Cub@@ an duo .
ease and flexibility - with these words , they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
apart from numerous Sal@@ mon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst fascin@@ ates also with intu@@ ition and artic@@ ulation .
balancing on a ball with the unic@@ ycle ?
no problem for He Yuan .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst writes : &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not doing well . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read from the eyes whenever possible .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
the top commandment therefore : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together in one enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst writes .
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 viewers , we always give our best and are with all our heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to his ideas from 17 to 20 September every day .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm prices are discounted .
the animals are also open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe delivers false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by the opposition &apos;s claims that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned against accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
in the past month they had rested on him and interrupted him during his remarks on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the talk he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; Death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity ends in the Parliament , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will work up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service business operations .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in the transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ parall@@ eled , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to produce electrical installations and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to handle the turning away from traditional computers to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies can perform better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in view of his history his participation in the next summer will surely be uncertain at the European Championship .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this type of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is no longer a matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
an unpleasant pattern is also developed .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere diseases since his debut six years ago .
he also played 157 League games in just 65 of Arsen@@ als in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes there will be an improvement in the injury ratio during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win battle force , &quot; says Wen@@ ger .
jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al starts his champ@@ ions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns into a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to get a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al are clearly favor@@ ites to continue through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was sho@@ cked by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with 3,2 jud@@ ging on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger thinks that Arsen@@ al has pulled the lesson from the previous season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains from far @-@ away hope to lead the club to its first European Cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the Com@@ edy Show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem the Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that men prevented from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritu@@ ally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication conducted through social media , with its emphasis on style over substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear powerful , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation is domin@@ ating .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health far deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty at Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when watching football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the y@@ earning of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it even though they often feel relu@@ ct@@ ant to explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a telephone counsel@@ or told me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My hearing role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide , has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often unable to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the perfect setting to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know which difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning until the end - the total 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to mal@@ treat Hun@@ ed@@ oara
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
at his debut in the Champions League , di Maria will meet on Tuesday and will help PS@@ G to move past Malm@@ ö .
here are the game reports and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the road , but after that she missed a number of opportunities before she finally raised her lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A Paris requires a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it does not only seek the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it wasn &apos;t a class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we need to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; says Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t achieved one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris @-@ Team , which could last weekend a 2 : 2 decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an imp@@ eller became the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he indicated why when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who proposed Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , played at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in advance .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who scored in the first half of not less than five tests alone and then abandoned after having used Cav@@ ani after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shot that was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth Se@@ as@@ onal Gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had a left flan@@ k from Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can return to the game , and only an excellent penetration of Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the final score low before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi arrived at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have played only in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hat@@ s off Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore collects $ 2.5 billion by share sales
the mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore , which is based in Switzerland , has accumulated 2.5 billion dollars from stock sales as part of its gigantic debt rep@@ tile plan on Wednesday .
the London @-@ registered company Gl@@ enc@@ ore stated in a statement that it sold new shares worth about $ 1.6 billion in order to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is fighting with falling raw material prices since China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of reference rights brought Gl@@ ace &apos;s share price to the top of the London stock exchange at the early Wednesday morning trading .
the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore last week announced the 2.5 billion $ share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around one @-@ third of its $ 30 billion debts .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion stocks in the value of up to 9,99 percent of the group .
concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years short of the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who at that time played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times Cup winner , four times Champions League winner , twice champion champion , twice champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in summer the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left Barcelona for 24 years and switched to Qatar as al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi advis@@ es now that he was already standing before the f@@ arewell from Barcelona before the 2008 European Championship .
&quot; I told Bar@@ ça to sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won everything , we did nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered FC Bayern was registered as well .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
as a reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this is now working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola in agreement and I have played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with that , he got me . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns season 2008 / 2009 had run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bayern over the whole distance on the lawn , split the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King Cl@@ asses triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown as a discussion about the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown broke down as this emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the filling of the film and not in the filling of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
brown responded sho@@ cked , with ins@@ ul@@ ting un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . al@@ right , &quot; as the comment@@ ators of The Mar@@ tian confirmed .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers &apos; colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is an ut@@ te , who is beaten by her white col@@ der .
the producer of Dear White People hired Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on answered that her direc@@ ting &quot; in the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded against endor@@ sement of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Mr Po@@ oni &apos;s Twitter users expressed anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - this is SO KNO@@ W@@ ING that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 people since its publication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments arrive at a time when accurate ra@@ cial representation is at the head of the social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved nation@@ wide impact and forced legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured restra@@ int .
in February , singer Prince made a reference to the movement while introducing the nominated albums of the year at Gramm@@ y Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leader of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter has published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck whether the group should be regarded as a hate @-@ group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ chi invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; cro@@ wned first champion
professional sports climbing and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete to win the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who could complete all levels of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 @-@ foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge for three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under shock over the profits of the big prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than $ 10,000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Isaac E ! on his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer , K@@ ent We@@ ed , sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great gra@@ ti@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s excited about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac felt the same if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eb@@ all , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers were reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins wast@@ ed a chance to climb within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , al@@ beit only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ Word , which was so difficult to hold over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all the vic@@ tories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tiger &apos;s manager Brad Kis@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scores three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at the bul@@ l@@ pen every game , and so I want to go all the way into the game .
the designed tiger @-@ dog Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two runs , his first r@@ until since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three hit game ever since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has curved the heart@@ wood , &quot; Aus@@ mus said .
he looked good at ( strike training ) , clearly saw better off the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh interior , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy ran down the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who designed a Two @-@ Run for the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the conclu@@ ding run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third woo@@ er Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time this season in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a Double Play
after Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth interior , wall made a R@@ BI double against C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed person stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detroit became the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game from an un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list , after having been missing more than a month due to a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started releasing and sens@@ ed that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , Hus@@ hes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success @-@ series with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers settled in the second , obtained a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t beat very well , but he got the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns in six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
remarks : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the S@@ hou@@ lder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder strain , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is painted by the vulner@@ ability list to launch against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since the 20th of August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .

the people in it were to be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden communicated on Tuesday evening .
it counted 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hessen State Capital have been prepared for this event in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there .
they will then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse , responsible for the initial up@@ take , have arrived in Hessen .
due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the resol@@ ute reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective directions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we were glad that the cup of a military involvement in Germany had passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive stock@@ pil@@ ing of international aid on the spot for the refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria has also established controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Austrian interior minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , and no one is sent back to Hungary .
Germany too has sent no refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could take on a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives in Germany .
she did not give concrete figures and pointed out discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann submitted a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
given the strong refugee population in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel at the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Federal Chancell@@ ery in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who need protection , also conf@@ use them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who don &apos;t have a lead @-@ perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was clearly divided into the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania could be reached with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent sm@@ ug@@ gling from escap@@ ing over Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to on the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of other migrants report@@ edly made their way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the Ice App@@ r@@ enti@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sw@@ app@@ ings .
this is what researchers conclude from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
according to this , the moon stum@@ bles easily on its path around the ring planets .
although this motion is only small , but still too large for a thoroughly solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; specialist sheet .
it has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
so &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered iron vul@@ can@@ e in 2006 at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ it the water vap@@ our and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn .
at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not cleared .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his lean line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them are B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when purchasing , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
they should store at room temperature and consume within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives a special touch to sav@@ ory dishes .
it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf@@ lets like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a man@@ go ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first f@@ uss @-@ storm , then striking cold front
in the coming night falls in the valleys of the mountain@@ ous side of the fo@@ eh@@ n , as Mete@@ o@@ Switzerland divided on Tuesday .
on Wedn@@ es@@ days and in the night until Thursday the fo@@ eh@@ n blows up with storm @-@ strength through the fo@@ eh@@ iers .
after f@@ uss on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front that brings heavy ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature drop .
as Mete@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the side of the Alps , the valley breaks through the valleys in the night to Wednesday .
in the episode , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows up until Thursday morning in the fo@@ oth@@ ills with bu@@ cks of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly also in the ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can advance to the adjacent centre of Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity at the Alp@@ ens@@ ü@@ d@@ hang begins to th@@ aw .
here the rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter must be expected , this after heavy ra@@ inf@@ all has already fallen during the last few days .
on Thursday morning the air flies out and a cold front with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east through Switzerland rolls out .
along with the cold front , the wind refres@@ hes strongly to stor@@ m@@ ically , and the temperatures drop significantly .
the following days are present in the north from 15 to 20 degrees in the north . in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now acknowledged as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an congregation in Rome , rec@@ alled on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live only in secret to their faith in the city of Pop@@ es for centuries .
with this place , it is symbo@@ lically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) beha@@ ved as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city as a promised sin @-@ be@@ ak at that time .
his negative impressions , according to histori@@ ans , might have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his thes@@ es against Ab@@ las@@ h@@ andel .
hammer Artist investing three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thor@@ ns is one of the master@@ pieces painted by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Testament , which is now published with splendid pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 designs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 year old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite glo@@ omy .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has taken a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of books .
cycles that focus on topics such as cross @-@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments or pat@@ ernity are created .
he has spontane@@ ously fascinated several partners : this is true of the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who separated himself on the basis of painting with the respective biblical passages .
he interpre@@ ts the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into current context .
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quot@@ ation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who here form@@ ulates his personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old equally allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict prot@@ est@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the up@@ bringing happened with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to forgive myself again with the Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to make art again more important in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is characterized by advertising today , and it is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; fall into the pictures , &quot; let them appear , discover and sense what force they have : &quot; the picture is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost admitted on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &quot; : &quot; I like living with his pictures . &quot;
I did not care to complete the Bible completely , but also chosen the mysterious themes that were important to him .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here are the pictures , the text only explains . &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for mice both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opening on November 15 at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X rail@@ ways se@@ am
plans made , place , companies commissioned , earth @-@ hill for a round course model@@ ed : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway it was already finished .
failures in politics and administration ensured tre@@ ach@@ ery , especially among the residents who did not want to toler@@ ate the railway .
thus hill down@@ wards , new place searched - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the permit will be approved in October , the first church member Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck is now available in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further comm@@ em@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees by 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga is setting a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football respon@@ ds to the sharpen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in cop@@ ing with the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider it the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle nobody can say that &apos;s nothing to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to discuss the refugee status in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the pul@@ pit next Wednesday and meet the state minister Mrs. O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football could and would help .
but the decisive course must be the policy .
the German Football Association therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach explained at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal lists also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional associations will sign a clear sign when they will be able to &quot; help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen sports director Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a &quot; matter of course . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody must see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can use football Bundes@@ liga , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their own places was great .
just as great is that small and minor criminals are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; that we spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this year and next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government will provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already rec@@ alled the entire sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in cases of accident
according to several reports , the head of the board of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried on his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost blood@@ thir@@ sty , he was power@@ less , then to@@ wed to the road - this he told us last week , &quot; rec@@ ites the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to get up again if you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren Re@@ placement Pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except Battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen twe@@ ed an appropriate photograph and explained that he suffered injuries when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes as little as a spare driver for the two common @-@ pilots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button on weekends as a week later , as one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback by Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europa League will definitely be sm@@ ashed .
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga also in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot resort to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high loading of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its tri@@ bal position on the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change to the goal keeper &apos;s position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the plaz@@ a of the b@@ art@@ ender Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion .
however , Tu@@ ch@@ el has left whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be deployed in all Europe @-@ League matches in the future .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ warding statement by fellow player Re@@ us , that the final call for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , is understandable speaker Julian Wei@@ gl : &quot; with this Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead a pioneering role in Germany
according to the German Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological leader in the change of the car .
on Wednesday the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the car fair I@@ AA of a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and net@@ worked driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 states , which are also coming together with representatives of the industry at the International Motor Show .
the strategy paper of the Transport Ministry , among other things , emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a high level of digital radio technology .
for the testing of new technology , there is currently a test track on the free@@ way 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use itself internationally to raise the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometers kilometers .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 will be technically feasible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should not be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study for 2025 will appreciate about 8.@@ 4 billion euros in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the German site in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD &apos;s traffic expert S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly defined .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey carried out on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of investig@@ ators Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in the first 20 years , 31 percent do not believe at all .
in France 21 per cent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed until 2025 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital network , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
the control under no circumstances would be left to the car .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis
according to the current status of the title fight , the Düsseldorf Congress will only hit the single one in sing@@ les from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision will be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and with that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18th , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show of his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , he was against it because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition was a little bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one dies , one arrives at the museum .
the impressive collection had previously taken place in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly survi@@ ving work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall art work for which much effort was done : to fres@@ hen the doll@@ s , for example a sty@@ list was hired .
the makers , according to the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , went to Munich for 14 tons of material .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather pants un@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
also Gau@@ l@@ ti@@ ers old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , delicate fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his t@@ ed@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him .
he later taught the design of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
he didn &apos;t have to pay the models for his first show of fashion .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of curtain - Pl@@ auen lace as fashion niche
earlier we went to the long embroi@@ dery mil@@ king machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make some meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were produced in large quantities for customers , which they worked on for example for blank@@ ets and she@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this alone is no longer working , &quot; says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Pl@@ auen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , fashion is important again .
fashion plays a major role in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , and was then displac@@ ed by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lin@@ dustrie ( Heim@@ tex@@ til Industry ) - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects by@@ gone p@@ its , is an increasing order potential .
anyone who doesn &apos;t use niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make up half of all orders .
barn Pl@@ auen is a member of the Pl@@ auen lace and embroi@@ der@@ ies association , together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialized stores and also the wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products are hardly accessible to customers in this way .
today , mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and are exp@@ elled almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , currently acc@@ eding to Russia and the USA .
enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula peasant explains by the embroi@@ der in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
master designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the West Saxony University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the faculty of applied arts - and speci@@ alis@@ es in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to meet the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ bu@@ ked the historic snow@@ ball point .
at the same time , the machine sti@@ cks small spheres in some places .
the Pl@@ auen &apos;s gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took the inspiration : &quot; I was not able to start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and who would like to have a souven@@ ir .
with this I see my jewellery as modern ambassador of Pl@@ auen lace .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not to be touched , but Disney is still dar@@ ing a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a re@@ fil@@ ming , but a kind of continuation , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magical baby girl .
it &apos;s about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the director states : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rob Marshall , last time with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
the economy has to open wider out@@ ward to promote growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group assigned to steering the reform .
&quot; China should be committed to attra@@ cting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Command Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , to include private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the inhabitants reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created which identi@@ fies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in al@@ loc@@ ating resources , ensuring a far @-@ right business environment and making the market open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on powers transferred to companies and ensure companies decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the meeting Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated as reported in a statement issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and therefore expect a significantly higher dose of the neur@@ on tox@@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Consumer Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding working paper on the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of inf@@ alli@@ ate industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury , that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be inde@@ cent .
in exchange for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to shar@@ pen the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
however , F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller gra@@ vey@@ ards , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which accum@@ ulates strongly over the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small amounts can already cause damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the maximum values in force , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury is primarily driven by coal burning into the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants cast more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity of Germany em@@ itted .
the concentration of mercury in fish , for example in Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; permanently and nation@@ wide crossed , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted from paper in March .
last year warnings from mercury in fish counted among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
