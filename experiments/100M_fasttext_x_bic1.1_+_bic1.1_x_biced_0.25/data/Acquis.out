on request of the organization , the community or a state , consultations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention will be examined by the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council invites the community and the concerned state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
except for any dispute related to the Council pursuant to Article 19 or a measure adopted by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be resolved on the request of a party to a Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal , consisting of five arbitr@@ ators .
the community and states appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators named four arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth who presi@@ des over the chair@@ manship .
if the Community and the States or the Organization are not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application , the community or the organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators .
the same procedure is applicable if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within thirty days of the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear weapons states , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the community , in force , i ) if the relevant State of the Organization is notified that its proceedings are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention , and
( II ) If the community of the organization stipul@@ ates that it is able to apply its safegu@@ ards in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties about a change in this Convention .
B ) All changes require the approval of the organization , the community and the states .
C ) The General Director shall immediately inform all member states of the organization of any change in this Convention .
a ) This Convention shall enter into force on the day that the organization of the Community and the States receive the written notification that its proceedings are concluded for entry into force .
B ) This agreement remains in force for so long as the states are contracting party of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedure as required in the implementation of the provisions of the part I on securing measures .
the objective of the process of securing measures specified in this agreement is the timely detection of the diver@@ gence of significant quantities of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rence of such a rejection by the risk of premature discovery .
in order to enrich the target set in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with the spatial orientation and observation as important supple@@ mental measures .
the technical completion of the audi@@ ts by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the quantity of material specified for each material balance zone specified for a certain period of time is specified , stating the accuracy limits for the specified amounts .
in carrying out their investigations , the organization after Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
when applying its preventive measures , the community of de proceedings and actions will make use of the following ways and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are closer to the supplementary agreements and are expe@@ dient :
a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of preserved , produced , offset , lost or otherwise from the residual material removed from the stock and the quantities ;
B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of tran@@ smit@@ ters and receivers ;
( e ) Methods to evaluate stock@@ pil@@ ing of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which points out the core material inventory and changes of this stock for each material balance zone including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
( g ) precau@@ tions that ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safegu@@ arding measures under this Convention do not extend to material in the mining industry or in ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) , is introduced into the states , thus dividing the organisation of the organization the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is in@@ stituted for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves the core material suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced or is introduced into the states in a later stage of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other preventive measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The safegu@@ arding measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , if the conditions specified in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the community is , however , un@@ desirable or desirable from resi@@ dues arising from resi@@ dues , the organization and the community must consult each other on the use of suitable preventive measures .
B ) The safegu@@ arding measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will be terminated for nuclear material under the conditions mentioned in article 13 , provided that the organization and the community are am@@ using that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
upon request of the Community , the organisation liber@@ ates the following core material from the safegu@@ arding measures according to this agreement :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities under Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is above 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the organisation liber@@ ates nuclear material , which would otherwise be subject to safety measures under this agreement , from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the total amount of core material liberated in the States due to this article is no longer at any point in time .
a ) a total of one kilogra@@ m of particular material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , by multip@@ lication of its weight with the enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natural ur@@ anium , is calculated by the multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
should liber@@ alised nuclear material be processed or stored together with nuclear material , which is subject to the safegu@@ arding measures under this Convention , precau@@ tions are taken for the re@@ use of the securing measures to that material .
the community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements necessary in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective explanation of the tasks of the Organisation according to this Convention , in detail how the procedures established in the Convention are to be applied .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without alter@@ ing the agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to make these agreements come into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report referred to in Article 62 , the organization establishes a consolidated inventory of the total nuclear material underlying this Convention in the States , irrespective of its origin , and carries out this inventory on the basis of the following reports and the results of its investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States , Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other .
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the International Economic Cooperation Conference to help counter@@ act the immediate need of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ ration problems .
C ) It is the objective of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is tied within six months of entering into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds in order to ensure a broad and well @-@ balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table which can be seen in the manner in which it intends to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special Trade Account &quot; which consists of the funds raised by the Member States in accordance with this Agreement ; this account is governed by the organization as administrator . ( in this property , the organization is referred to as the &quot; Administrator &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is separated and managed separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment will be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ its of the member state , which on demand in the currency of the respective state to pay an order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment shall be made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days of entering into force of this agreement or any other time agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator ;
II ) the second in the amount of the balance of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Every member state can make payments prior to the above dates if desired .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker accepts approximately proportional drawing on the cash or the school ja@@ ar to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to compensate for the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
when granting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC :
( III ) the extent in which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
( VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its subsequent lending capacity to loan terms without dis@@ advantageous ; and
VII ) to the extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be governed by contributions from other sources .
every single transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly re@@ payable development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered , approved and administered by the ordinary means of the organization ( letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the means of the transaction cannot be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which is tied to a program or project within the framework of a loan or credit that has already been approved by the Bank or the Bank &apos;s directors on the day of entering into force .
apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same pay@@ back conditions that are generally accepted for the organization granted for the organization ; thus , they are re@@ payable in the age of ten years each in 50 years .
transaction Lo@@ ans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of this bid must be paid directly to the organization that maintains them .
each special transaction loan is to be evi@@ cted by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is given .
the proceeds from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the recipient country &apos;s currency or for goods or services produced or delivered in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which , according to the administrator at the time of lending , could be a recipient of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments of special transaction loans are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the administrator to the Member State as soon as possible .
until full payment of all special transaction loans , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ EC concerning the projects and programs approved by the directors in preparation for the inspection by the directors .
during the time of re@@ payment of the special transaction loans , the administrator conduc@@ ts the E@@ EC four times a year on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this .
the administrator con@@ veys the E@@ EC as soon as possible after conclusion of the financial year of the organization a detailed statement of the transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization on this account .
after full payment of the transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker of the E@@ EC transm@@ its a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the transaction bank as soon as possible .
the car@@ et@@ aker creates and performs appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are evident from the account recei@@ pts , the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to Member States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker are working closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the bai@@ li@@ ff up to the full issue of the means of the special transaction account from time to time carry out an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special action dar@@ es , and all other matters relating to the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on December 31 , 1978 or at a later date when the E@@ EC and the organization may be agreed , the agreement and all obligations arising there@@ from are due immediately .
if the total amount of the total capital of all the recipients re@@ mitted to the subscri@@ bers in accordance with article II Section 8 of this Agreement is rep@@ aid and transferred to Member States , this agreement and all of the resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval from the Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States notified the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the procedure .
the Sec@@ retariat of General direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the proper approval of the Agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each word being equally authentic .
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter of correspondence to the amend@@ ment of Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics

the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Federal Council , &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the project JET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are referred to as a joint company according to Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called the &quot; Common Enterprise JET . &quot;
Switzerland has been involved in research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
since extensive work has to be carried out until the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , it is in the interest of the contracting parties to summ@@ ari@@ ze their relevant efforts in order to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to expe@@ dite their respective research work , which has attained a higher priority due to the energy crisis .
this agreement will enable any contracting party to take the greatest possible benefit by merging its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for the research work , i.e. , the cost @-@ effectively competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction to reach faster .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the parties are associ@@ ating their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this Agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Program &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot;
to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over long @-@ term objectives and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it is extended or changed after inspection by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme .
every time the parties accept a new programme , this is replaced by the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II .
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 is realized by : - appropriate participation of each of the parties during the preparation and execution of the programmes of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom member states , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories that work on the Eur@@ atom programme ;

now , however , some conditions are mentioned below for which the BI@@ S would be ready .
in each stand@@ by loan , the BI@@ S would first assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , but a total of five years would be exceeded .
in the opening of the loans as well as for any extension , the BI@@ S would charge a loan opening fee .
in addition , it is agreed that the first draw will not be made before the end of a month after the Stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the draws would be made in the currencies available at the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time which would be taking into account the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ S applies at the time to under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely match the market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S must obtain the necessary funds on the market itself , the interest rate used to be applied could reach a maximum by which the Libor corresponds to a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would give me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make an appropriate request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would give me the approval of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Committee shall ensure that the proper use of this Agreement is not affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not named tari@@ ff numbers after the Community .
the Committee discusses all issues arising from the implementation of these agreements and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall be governed without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .

I honor you to inform you that my government can agree to the for@@ ego@@ ing and that your letter and response together form an agreement according to your proposal .
in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of Uruguay on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb meat
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to define provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community .
- fresh or cooled chicken , lamb and goat meat ( Tari@@ ff 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common customs tari@@ ff ) ;
- frozen chicken , lamb and goat meat ( Tari@@ ff 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Custom@@ s Tari@@ ff .
under this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set according to the Community by the following annual quantity :
in order to ensure the faul@@ tless functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is obliged to ensure that the agreed amount of the annual quantity does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out according to the standard offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form be made possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee referred to below , in order to find a suitable solution .
in the event that the Community acc@@ uses the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an access to the Community market is not affected by this agreement .
in case the imports from Uruguay should exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end the imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year concerned .
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ech@@ rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
with the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the amount set by number 2 according to the amount of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
import burdens for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall take account of the Ho@@ ech@@ ism of the exhaus@@ tion mentioned under No. 5 .
the total amount under # 2 is set to 5 800 metric tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight with the day of accession of Greece to the community .
the community under@@ takes everything in order to avoid market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat in the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the community takes precau@@ tions so that the sale of frozen meat on frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the implementation of the ordin@@ ance of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ine she@@ ep@@ skin .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of lamb and lamb , as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , will only be carried out at prices and conditions that are in line with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) ( c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ customs and Trade Agreement .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen , which is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or any other substance indicated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena shall not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the title is measured by repeatedly th@@ inning the re@@ agent to be tested on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; th@@ inning is calculated exclusively by the volume of the blood cell in@@ undation in the total volume .
in the case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are developed at present .
according to definition , an international standard product contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents to determine the blood type determination of most speci@@ f@@ ties is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ ination sti@@ cker , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in an ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flood .
the title shows the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last compound within a series , in which a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the international standard preparations ( at the moment Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ exhaus@@ tive anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the restoration of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International standard preparation or a state standard preparation in International units ( See Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren will contain 256 international units per ml according to definition .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative cap@@ tion of the International standard anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , the required properties shall remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in flu@@ vial form according to label resi@@ des at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date on the label for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the durability tests ; it must be approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so sealed that no humidity can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ oric pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the sol@@ vents supplied with the re@@ agents ) is added an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic unless the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and efficacy .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml liquid or re @-@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re@@ plen@@ ishment , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments or deposits or visible particles .
the re@@ agents used for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be arti@@ ficially colored , at least as long as not until an International Convention on a unified system has come about .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all the production stages and controls of the re@@ agents for the determination of the blood group .
adequate samples of all the re@@ agents spent can be stored for a long time from the laboratory , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids for strengthening the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective suit in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each container , a black and white label is available in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishing ,
furthermore , the label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers , contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishing ,
each consi@@ gn@@ ment must be enclosed in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention in accordance with Section 4 of the Convention .

in addition , it is parallel to the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparative test against an in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells .
the effectiveness of the serum may in no case be less than 64 international units per ml .
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause an easily recognizable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells .

the following requirements for the efficacy of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h Group may possibly change if International standard medicines are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons , which are immun@@ ised by the tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D serv@@ a must have a title of at least 1 : 32 in relation to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9 percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a &quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ rh@@ o ) serum or a corresponding comparative prescription against C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the serum may react with blood cells containing do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which is intended for the use of slides according to the diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons , which are immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen .
these Ser@@ a are therefore only specific for the C @-@ an@@ tigen only when the tested blood cells are washed up in a 0.@@ 9 percent sal@@ ine solution .
the Tit@@ er of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ dee @-@ blood cells .
anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on slides in accordance with the diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons , which are immun@@ ised by the tigen E of the R@@ h system .

anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which is intended for use on slides in accordance with the diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and not contained in any form of anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies have to be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions set by the manufacturer .
if a serum for use on slides is determined according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation period in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be inferior to the ant@@ om@@ ous antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances in the group A .

anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells containing B an@@ tigen , that is those of the blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates no human red blood cells that contain no B an@@ tigen , that is those of the blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparative prescription , with an in@@ undation of blood cells of group B to Tit@@ ania ( 1 ) .
if anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % floo@@ ding of B @-@ blood cells , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required if the same attempt with the re@@ pri@@ zed but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard prepar@@ at of the same avi@@ dity is performed .
anti @-@ Human @-@ Glob@@ ulin @-@ serum for the use in blood group ser@@ ology must include ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is obtained from the blood of animals , which are immun@@ ised by inj@@ ections of human serum proteins .
if it is used according to the manufacturer &apos;s prescription , it does not ag@@ glut@@ inate un@@ loaded human red blood cells , no matter which blood type they belong .
