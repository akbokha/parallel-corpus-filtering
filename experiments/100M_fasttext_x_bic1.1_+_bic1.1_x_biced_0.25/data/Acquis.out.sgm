<seg id="4">Considering the Ordinance of the Swiss Federal Council of 23 December 1971 on the use of the Swiss name for watches,</seg>
<seg id="5">Considering the close co-operation between the European Economic Community and Switzerland in the field of watchmaking,</seg>

<seg id="8">1. the raw materials produced in the community, which are listed in the list attached to the agreement, as well as the regulated trades produced in the community and other components of the movement, which are manufactured in Switzerland or in the community, are considered to be of equivalent quality as raw materials and individual parts of Swiss manufacturing with comparable technical characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="9">Watches and movements assembled from these pieces and components must meet the requirements of statutory technical control in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="10">2. the list of raw materials produced in the Community in paragraph 1 is regularly updated for the following modalities:</seg>
<seg id="11">A) The application for the incorporation of new raw materials into the list is directed by the associations of the watch industry of the community or the producers of raw materials based in the community on the Swiss watch chamber. a technical description of the raw material can be enclosed to the application.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Swiss association of watches wears this or the new calibers immediately into the so-called list.</seg>
<seg id="13">If the inclusion in the list for a raw material caliber has already been applied, which has already been used in Switzerland and has not passed the legal technical control in Switzerland, the Swiss watchmaking chamber can reject the recording.</seg>
<seg id="14">B) The withdrawal from the list of raw materials listed in the list is communicated by the associations of the watch industry of the community or from the manufacturer who had previously requested the admission to the Swiss watchmaking chamber.</seg>
<seg id="15">C) If the requirements of legal technical control in Switzerland are not fulfilled, the Swiss watchmaking chamber can demand the cancellation of the relevant raw materials from the list; it is informed of this by the party concerned.</seg>
<seg id="16">If the latter does not agree, then within two months she can claim the procedure referred to in paragraph 3.</seg>
<seg id="17">D) Every request for amending the list according to the letter a), b) and c) is immediately shown to the chamfered committee of the Swiss watchmaking chamber.</seg>
<seg id="18">3. in order to determine the quality of the quality, the Commission determined in Article 9 of the Agreement of 30 June 1967 shall be dealt with immediately by the parties concerned.</seg>
<seg id="19">The first acting party seeks out from the Institute for the official quality control in the Swiss watchmaking industry as well as a corresponding qualified institute of the community designated by the relevant party of the community in order to receive a common report.</seg>
<seg id="20">With regard to this expert opinion, the institutes agree to take out watches or movements from a Swiss company and from a company of the community, which is sufficiently representative and basically no more than 50 watches or movements.</seg>
<seg id="21">After checking these games according to the standards of legal technical control in Switzerland, the institutes compare their results and create a common report for the Gemisite Commission with their conclusions and their eventual proposals.</seg>
<seg id="22">The agreement and the list attached to it are published in official publication organs of the contracting parties and communicated to watch manufacturers by the relevant professional associations.</seg>
<seg id="23">At least every three years, calculated from the entry into force of the agreement, the Commission proposes a redesign of the list in order to take account of the entries and matches that have now taken place.</seg>
<seg id="24">The agreement entered into force on 1 January 1973, provided the ratification certificates have been replaced by this date.</seg>
<seg id="25">If the exchange of ratification certificates takes place between 1 January and 30 November 1973, the agreement will come into force on the first day of the second month of the second month.</seg>

<seg id="696">The objective of the process of securing measures specified in this agreement is the timely detection of the divergence of significant quantities of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes as well as the deterrence of such a rejection by the risk of premature discovery.</seg>
<seg id="697">In order to enrich the target set in Article 28, material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance, combined with the spatial orientation and observation as important supplemental measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical completion of the audits by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the quantity of material specified for each material balance zone specified for a certain period of time is specified, stating the accuracy limits for the specified amounts.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out their investigations, the organization after Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the Community for Nuclear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">When applying its preventive measures, the community of de proceedings and actions will make use of the following ways and, as far as necessary, foresee how they are closer to the supplementary agreements and are expedient:</seg>
<seg id="702">A) a measurement system for determining the quantities of preserved, produced, offset, lost or otherwise from the residual material removed from the stock and the quantities;</seg>
<seg id="703">B) the evaluation of reproducibility and accuracy of measurements and estimation of measurement uncertainty;</seg>
<seg id="704">C) procedures for determining, checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of transmitters and receivers;</seg>
<seg id="705">(e) Methods to evaluate stockpiling of non-measured stocks and not measured losses;</seg>
<seg id="706">F) a protocol and reporting system, which points out the core material inventory and changes of this stock for each material balance zone including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone;</seg>
<seg id="707">(g) precautions that ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly;</seg>
<seg id="708">H) procedures for reimbursement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69.</seg>
<seg id="709">The safeguarding measures under this Convention do not extend to material in the mining industry or in ore processing.</seg>
<seg id="710">B) Uran - or thorium-containing material, which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c), is introduced into the states, thus dividing the organisation of the organization the quantity and composition of the material, unless it is instituted for specifically non-nuclear purposes;</seg>
<seg id="711">C) leaves the core material suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or isotopic enrichment, the plant or the process phase in which it is produced or is introduced into the states in a later stage of the nuclear fuel cycle, so it is subject to the other preventive measures mentioned in this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="712">A) The safeguarding measures envisaged in this Convention shall be terminated for nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 11. however, if the conditions specified in Article 11 are not fulfilled, the community is, however, undesirable or desirable from residues arising from residues, the organization and the community must consult each other on the use of suitable preventive measures.</seg>
<seg id="713">B) The safeguarding measures envisaged in this Convention will be terminated for nuclear material under the conditions mentioned in article 13, provided that the organization and the community are amusing that this core material is virtually non-recoverable.</seg>
<seg id="714">Upon request of the Community, the organisation liberates the following core material from the safeguarding measures according to this agreement:</seg>
<seg id="715">A) special fissile material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments;</seg>
<seg id="716">B) core material if it is used for non-nuclear activities under Article 13, if such core material is recoverable, and</seg>
<seg id="717">C) Plutonium with an isotope concentration of Plutonium-238, which is above 80%.</seg>
<seg id="718">At the request of the Community, the organisation liberates nuclear material, which would otherwise be subject to safety measures under this agreement, from these safeguards, provided that the total amount of core material liberated in the States due to this article is no longer at any point in time.</seg>
<seg id="719">A) a total of one kilogram of particular material that can consist of one or more of the following materials:</seg>

<seg id="721">III) Uran with an accumulation, which is below 0.2 (20%) and above that of natural uranium, is calculated by the multiplication of its weight with the five-fold square of enrichment;</seg>
<seg id="722">B) a total of ten metric tons of natural uranium and depleted uranium with an enrichment of more than 0.005 (0.5%);</seg>
<seg id="723">C) twenty metric tons of depleted uranium with an enrichment of 0.005 (0.5%) or below;</seg>
<seg id="724">Should liberalised nuclear material be processed or stored together with nuclear material, which is subject to the safeguarding measures under this Convention, precautions are taken for the reuse of the securing measures to that material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements necessary in the scope, which is necessary for the successful and effective explanation of the tasks of the Organisation according to this Convention, in detail how the procedures established in the Convention are to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="726">The supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without altering the agreement in agreement between the organization and the community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention. the organization, the community and the states undertake all efforts to make these agreements come into force within ninety days of the entry into force; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report referred to in Article 62, the organization establishes a consolidated inventory of the total nuclear material underlying this Convention in the States, irrespective of its origin, and carries out this inventory on the basis of the following reports and the results of its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States, Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other.</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the International Economic Cooperation Conference to help counteract the immediate need of individual countries with low income, whose development is hampered by general ressourcentration problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is tied within six months of entering into force of the agreement, and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds in order to ensure a broad and well-balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the organization of the EEC has presented a table which can be seen in the manner in which it intends to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the name "Special Trade Account" which consists of the funds raised by the Member States in accordance with this Agreement; this account is governed by the organization as administrator. (in this property, the organization is referred to as the "Administrator"), only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is separated and managed separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment will be made in the form of cash or non-interest debits of the member state, which on demand in the currency of the respective state to pay an order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment shall be made in two installments, namely i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the fee within 30 days of entering into force of this agreement or any other time agreed between the EEC and the administrator;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the balance of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the caretaker, taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Every member state can make payments prior to the above dates if desired.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the caretaker accepts approximately proportional drawing on the cash or the school jaar to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to compensate for the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">When granting these loans, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">(III) the extent in which international economic factors contributed to the current and foreseeable economic problems of the country;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its subsequent lending capacity to loan terms without disadvantageous; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) to the extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be governed by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Every single transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly repayable development programme or project (including a sectoral plan), whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization or not, according to the procedures and practices that are considered, approved and administered by the ordinary means of the organization (letter b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The means of the transaction cannot be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organisation, which is tied to a program or project within the framework of a loan or credit that has already been approved by the Bank or the Bank's directors on the day of entering into force.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special transaction loans are subject to the same payback conditions that are generally accepted for the organization granted for the organization; thus, they are repayable in the age of ten years each in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Transaction Loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for the payment of this bid must be paid directly to the organization that maintains them.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each special transaction loan is to be evicted by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the origin of the means is given.</seg>
<seg id="751">The proceeds from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the recipient country's currency or for goods or services produced or delivered in a member state; ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which, according to the administrator at the time of lending, could be a recipient of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of special transaction loans are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the administrator to the Member State as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until full payment of all special transaction loans, the caretaker teaches the EEC concerning the projects and programs approved by the directors in preparation for the inspection by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of repayment of the special transaction loans, the administrator conducts the EEC four times a year on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator conveys the EEC as soon as possible after conclusion of the financial year of the organization a detailed statement of the transaction account with an opinion of the external auditors of the organization on this account.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the transaction loan, the caretaker of the EEC transmits a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the transaction bank as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The caretaker creates and performs appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account, which are evident from the account receipts, the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to Member States.</seg>

<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the bailiff up to the full issue of the means of the special transaction account from time to time carry out an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special action dares, and all other matters relating to the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement is not entered into force on December 31, 1978 or at a later date when the EEC and the organization may be agreed, the agreement and all obligations arising therefrom are due immediately.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of the total capital of all the recipients remitted to the subscribers in accordance with article II Section 8 of this Agreement is repaid and transferred to Member States, this agreement and all of the resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="762">This agreement requires approval from the Member States and the EEC in accordance with the procedural provisions of each party.</seg>
<seg id="763">The governments of the Member States notified the Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the procedure.</seg>

<seg id="854">In the opening of the loans as well as for any extension, the BIS would charge a loan opening fee.</seg>
<seg id="855">In addition, it is agreed that the first draw will not be made before the end of a month after the Standby agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity.</seg>
<seg id="856">The draws would be made in the currencies available at the BIS at the conclusion of the agreement, very likely in US dollars; they would extend to periods of time which would be taking into account the funds of the Bank, presumably three or six months.</seg>
