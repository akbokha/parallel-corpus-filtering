Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have referred to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased anxiety or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for taking or the enam@@ el tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time that are broken down as well as abili@@ fy , the dose of abili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is believed to be a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , which reduces psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their recur@@ rence .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , the re@@ occurrence of symptoms , was studied in three studies for up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with abili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , with which from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the change in patients &quot; symptoms by means of a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to examine how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and resor@@ ption ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both trials with the injection solution , patients who received abili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , significantly increased the symptoms of increased un@@ rest than those who received placebo .
in four of the five short @-@ term studies , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
in addition , for up to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented effective treatment as placebo for re @-@ onset of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of abili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled so@@ cks ) , nausea , nausea , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , nausea , nausea , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who spoke mostly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole out@@ weigh the risks .
moreover , the committee concluded that the advantages of the injection solution in fast control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company , Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . , for placing abili@@ fy in the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven .
consideration for the greater sensitivity of this group of patients should be considered a lower initial dose if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in case of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , leak@@ age disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occ@@ uring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , consider reducing the dose or canc@@ eling the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding the deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally schiz@@ ophren@@ ic and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary action of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is required if Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective medicines with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ i@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensively metabol@@ ites .
considering the common application of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with abili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for patients .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be undertaken .
after putting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with Abi@@ li@@ fy , can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ amorph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ amorph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy because of insufficient data for human safety and due to the concerns raised in animal reproduction studies , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned about using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a generally lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under op@@ lan@@ t@@ ine therapy .
in a controlled study for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients suffering from hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS amounted to 18.@@ 2 % for patients treated with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
among the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older Dem@@ enti@@ a patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ doses with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosing since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption through the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ A receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ gen and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
with the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks in healthy subjects , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the Put@@ amen .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents who received a response to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ h depression rate scale , showed significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ c@@ ino @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia on how to lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics that did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , mainly in the prevention of a recur@@ rence in the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ zation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole for extensive metabol@@ ites over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 146 hours in &quot; poor &quot; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects in case of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients .
a specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different h@@ ep@@ atic cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in the case of dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , thus they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ reno@@ cor@@ tical toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosing ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ x of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole do not exceed 6 % of the concentrations observed in the study for 39 weeks in the g@@ all of apes , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .

it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption through the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in an O@@ lan@@ c@@ ino @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) at an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as a solution for taking 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the form of healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the central steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with systemic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the absorption and minim@@ ise vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deeply into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines already used for maintenance or ac@@ utely ( see section 4.5 ) .
if an additional oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to abili@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy enam@@ el tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were otherwise caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is deemed necessary in addition to the Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with respect to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure loss ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available to patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , leak@@ age disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occ@@ uring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding the deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally seen in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared with the following dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dosage ) was applied intra@@ muscular and the same time lau@@ z@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) were intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ i@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in contrast to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be undertaken .
after putting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared with the after all@@ some gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following side effects were more common in clinical studies using the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant adverse events ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS amounted to 18.@@ 2 % for patients treated with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
among the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older Dem@@ enti@@ a patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant improvements in ag@@ gi@@ ance / behavi@@ our@@ al dysfunction compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ a Reference arm .
the mean improvement from bas@@ eline value on P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined because of a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents who adher@@ ed to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary study targets including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed significantly greater improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher response rate for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ c@@ ino @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics that did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior position compared to placebo for the prevention of a recur@@ rence in the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the AU@@ C is equal to the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time up to reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - and 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity according to IV application showed no safety @-@ related concerns following mat@@ ernal exposure , which lay 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects have only been observed in the case of dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which have exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; thus they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent low @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adren@@ al @-@ state carcin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosing ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ fold of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold of the mean @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters earlier had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ some administration or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
considering only those who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators like time @-@ to @-@ worsen@@ ing of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the CH@@ MP committee noted that , unlike other pac@@ lit@@ axel , Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils of &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ therapy the dosage should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached in Grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function were performed and there is currently no sufficient data to suggest dose adjustment in patients with impairment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel that could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological features than other formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient may not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in the patients no repeated Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven in relation to cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , cardiac out@@ ages in the indicated patient population are not un@@ common , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if there is nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in the patients after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic drugs and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised before the treatment on a sperm conservation , as the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect traffic jams and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important cases of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quick reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood &apos;s heart disease :

pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , muscular pain , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , stro@@ mal pain , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients .
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an enhancement @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active substance that promotes the con@@ formation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells , and in in @-@ vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel by endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 Alb@@ at@@ ype receptor and , due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) , appears to be pac@@ lit@@ axel in the area of the tumour .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two random@@ ised , un@@ blin@@ ded studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ centre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks , either in form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion with no pre @-@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metastatic disease .
14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % only had adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive first @-@ line therapy are below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for decay on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the entire pac@@ lit@@ axel compared to 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials .
the active agent exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ al distribution and / or soft speed of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and the distribution volume was higher in Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ xi@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ a ex@@ cre@@ tion of less than 1 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel resulted in a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years because only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and above light light protected over 8 hours .

if you are using Abra@@ x@@ ane with other medicines please inform the doctor if you apply other medicines or have recently used it , even if it is not prescription drugs , as these might cause an interaction with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
in addition , they should be advised against a sperm preservation before the treatment , as the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment gives the possibility of lasting in@@ fertility .
wear and tear of machinery Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect traffic and the ability to operate machinery .
if you also receive other medicines during your treatment , you should consult your doctor regarding driving or serving machines .

member states must ensure that the owner of the marketing authorisation for placing on the market will provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training Bro@@ ch@@ ure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the medicine ( technical information ) , labelling and packaging . • Uni@@ que model depicting the correct application of the product for transport by patients .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , in which complications arise in the context of blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood @-@ blood @-@ donation is not possible prior to the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be monitored prior to treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequately address the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in the course of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference drug .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected by E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period between 25 and 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same extent as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most frequent side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion .
ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the European Union regulations , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that manufactures ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for the medical professionals in all member states , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ c medicinal products P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the placing of ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of the demand for trans@@ fusion in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma , which receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( for example cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in the case of planned larger operating interventions ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure in adults with no iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml can be used , which cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients , in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and effects may vary depending on age , gender and total disease ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient or under the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and - sequ@@ el@@ ae may vary depending on age , gender and total disease ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose required for checking the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to bas@@ eline value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l has risen to the bas@@ eline , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .

patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , where a precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods are required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body@@ weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should begin as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the onset of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - that large iron reserves are available before the start of the ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each in 10 consecutive days , on the day of engagement and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic salt solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation .
patients suffering from treatment with some ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin at a ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed or any other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein oc@@ clu@@ sion ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are unable to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe coron@@ ary heart disease , peripheral vascular disease , vascular disease of the carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported about the occurrence of an anti@@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes of non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ um@@ to@@ xi@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , in consideration of an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes &quot; Index &quot; ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other cause of a loss of action is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies are determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous application of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical trials an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ esis stimulating active substances ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials did not reveal any significant benefits that can be attributed to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins when the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for checking the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and avoiding blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ den@@ ced coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not yet liable to di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin response should be taken into account in the case of tumour patients under chemotherapy .
if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adapted according to section 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of potential th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit risk assessment involving the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
patients with a larger electrical orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure should , if possible , investigate the cause of an@@ a@@ emia before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ therapy and be treated accordingly .
patients undergoing a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure should receive adequate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a higher risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist for patients with an initial hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adapted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no indication of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
more than th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accidents , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m , retin@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , including patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or worsen@@ ing an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , there may be th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications in surgical patients with cardiovascular atro@@ phy after repeated blood donations .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ lic@@ ated and is identical with the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be shown with the aid of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not influence leu@@ kop@@ ov@@ ese .

in 1895 , patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tumors and 4@@ 78 other ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ oses .
survival and progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies the re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia consistent with an@@ a@@ emia due to a variety of frequent malign@@ ancies .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained satisfactory by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa rules after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa &apos;s serum levels are much lower than the serum levels achieved after IV inj@@ ections .
there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal experimental studies involving nearly 20 times the recommended weekly dose epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced im@@ balances of the body weight , a delay in the os@@ se@@ fication and an increase in the fet@@ al mortality rate .
these reports support in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

141 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
143 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension .

during treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , there may be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range .
your doctor will , if necessary , perform regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solving of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , loss of blood , vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated before beginning treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia , it will break your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia will be treated best .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by inj@@ ecting into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value could be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of hei@@ gh@@ tened or rising levels of potassium , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically open coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by inadequate heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level does not exceed a certain amount .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet liable to di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Her doctor will regularly determine your red blood dy@@ es ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose appropriately to minimize the risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be weighed very carefully towards the advantages derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or when in the past th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. a deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pulmon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
if you are a cancer patient , keep in mind that Ab@@ se@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative impact on the tumor .
if you &apos;re facing a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , before the start of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
if your red blood dy@@ es ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ot@@ ting after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently used / used it , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may possibly arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory studies have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia will respond to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works correctly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain amount .
once you are well set , you get regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread on two equal sized inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain amount .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control .
in order to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will carry out regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of operation and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash off ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin .

ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as in the H@@ indu@@ s ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following the in@@ fusion such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ ci@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ ci@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ ci@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included two 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently undergone a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of up to five years .
in two studies , Ac@@ ci@@ sta was tested in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of effectiveness was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in the serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ ap@@ sta ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients .
comparing all patients under Ac@@ ap@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under Plac@@ ebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures 9 % of patients under Ac@@ ci@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients in placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of ac@@ la@@ sta provides information material for physicians who prescri@@ be ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information on how to apply the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited &apos;s approval for Ac@@ ci@@ sta In@@ junction in the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following key messages include : • The package supplement • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and in nursing women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When resor@@ ting to medical or nursing aid
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous 5 mg ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ ci@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
following a treatment of Pa@@ get with Ac@@ ci@@ sta , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first Ac@@ ci@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol may be reduced by the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) Pati@@ ents with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min are not recommended because limited clinical experience exists for this patient population .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary , as bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination with older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ ci@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , since data for safety and efficacy is missing .
ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ c@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment with ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium , equivalent to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered an appropriate preventive dental treatment before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
for patients who require dental interventions , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan for each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be reduced shortly after applying acet@@ am@@ ol ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of suspected cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients receiving ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 from 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) were comparable to the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney function disorders associated with decrease of kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
changes in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ( measured per year before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as reduced kidney function were comparable in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis for three years comparable to the acet@@ ate and placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , compared to 21 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent frac@@ ture frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to administration of ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study were reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been shown , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interven@@ ing .
7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area with an ac@@ la@@ sta and a placebo @-@ treated patient .
in case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of oral calcium and / or an IV in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once annually for 3 consecutive years was demonstrated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 to 89 years ) or at least two mild or moderate existing spinal fluid or BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ score for the fem@@ oral contrac@@ ture ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric Ed@@ dy @-@ body frac@@ tures Ac@@ ci@@ sta were significantly over a period of three years , as well as the incidence of one or more new spinal frac@@ tures after one year ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ ci@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density at the lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radi@@ us compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ asing the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the knee @-@ neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) a year after the third annual dose bone biop@@ si@@ es were taken from the pel@@ vic ridge .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture compared to placebo .
bone tumor markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ PD ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in the serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during the study period .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ ci@@ sta significantly reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was kept at 28 % below the initial value for up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value for up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ g@@ age was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ ci@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ ci@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D compared to placebo for all time points .
the Ac@@ ci@@ sta treatment conducted more than 24 months compared to placebo for an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total and 4.3 % at the fem@@ oral neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % for Ac@@ ci@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ yearly administration of ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior to the weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate relative to the percentage change in BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline value .
clinical effectiveness of treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ ci@@ sta was studied in patients aged more than 30 years with radi@@ ologically proven , mainly moderate to moderate @-@ severe morph@@ ology Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron once a day for 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for ac@@ la@@ sta and ris@@ ed@@ ron .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach in 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ac@@ ron@@ at could be maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes per@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients resulted in the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
then the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearing from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ of α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the prescribed dose occurs in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body clearance is 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a reduction of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the area below the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a decreased clear@@ ance of substances met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
from this it follows that an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney dysfunction to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
because for severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ ally active intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
in studies in dogs single doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ x of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats was administered in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to the 6@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metaph@@ or of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats were treated with ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity of 0,2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the reduced serum calcium level .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally , 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .

according to the CH@@ MP Directive for Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted along with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known that could affect the current statements for safety , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • within 60 days if an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached . • On request of the E@@ MEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a class of substances called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially o@@ est@@ ro@@ gens , which are made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
bone reconstruction is quickly done with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
ac@@ la@@ sta acts by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forces the bone strength .
if you are in a dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you are treated with ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you are using ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently used / used it , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines that are known to harm the kidneys .
if you are using Ac@@ ci@@ sta together with food and drink , please be aware that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will have enough fluids before and after treatment with ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
since Ac@@ ci@@ sta acts for a long time , you may need to take another dose only after one year or more .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than a year and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ ci@@ sta was missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before the treatment ends with ac@@ la@@ sta if you are considering the termination of treatment with ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache , occur within the first three days following the administration of ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ pla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical signs because of excessive calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b@@ ness , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported primarily in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice any side effects not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for storage and storage conditions up to the application ; usually 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after ac@@ la@@ sta administration , the patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluids ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium , equivalent to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta .

A@@ COMP@@ LIA is also applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and / or overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and furthermore one or more I
in addition , there were four trials involving more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ LIA was used as a suppor@@ tive means to hi@@ ring smoking .
on the other hand , the studies on setting the smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ LIA was difficult to assess in this area of application .
what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ LIA ? he The most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ LIA , which were noted during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , were nausea and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or are treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants since it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , give rise to su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is advised when applying A@@ COMP@@ LIA with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ COMP@@ LIA in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
medicines used in patients who need it for health reasons and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and physicians ) , and around the oste@@ o@@ arthritis
it is also associated with diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which in addition have one or more risk factors including type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; COMP@@ LEX is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of absence of data on efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant must not be applied unless the benefits of treatment in the individual case exceed the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
also in patients with no recogn@@ is@@ able risks in addition to obesity , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other related persons ) are advised that it is necessary to over@@ see the new occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• Ol@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown adequately .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) more than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

a number of overweight patients as well as in patients with obesity have examined , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in additional indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects in placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients treated for weight reduction and associated metabolic diseases .
if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ates ( for adverse events ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse events &lt; 1 % ) .

in a case study involving a limited number of individuals of up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed .
patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hypertension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
weight reduction after one year amounted to 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the bas@@ eline value , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference - 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.@@ 3 ; -@@ 4,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated Type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 in placebo
the percentage of patients receiving H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant Group and 35 % in the placebo group .
the difference in the mean shift in weight between the 20 mg and the placebo group was 3.@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . LN
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were approximately 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and approximately 50 % explained by weight reduction .

5.3 The prec@@ lin@@ ical data on the safety of the following adverse effects not observed in clinical studies , which occurred in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic range , were considered to be relevant for the clinical application :
in some , however , not in all cases the start of con@@ vul@@ sions seems to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or menstru@@ al disturbances .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on the pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post @-@ nat@@ al development , exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations for the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not indicated .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be adjusted satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ ic resin or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ ic acid or insulin can be maintained with the start of the acet@@ ate treatment , except for hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia patients ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea and / or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients , Ac@@ tos efficacy was examined in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin . in addition , they received either acet@@ ate or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar values were lowered in the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the triple treatment study , the effect of the additional administration of acet@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who received additional placebo .
the most common side effects associated with acet@@ ate were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thesia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for Ac@@ tos in the European Union .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( i.e. , previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase dosage .
patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserves .
patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with elevated output liver enzyme levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels are to be controlled again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as nausea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels must be checked .
the decision as to whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued until the laboratory parameters have been evaluated by clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated that can ag@@ itate fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparison @-@ controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.@@ 6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lesser extent in patients under sul@@ phon@@ yl res@@ ins and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , there is a risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia in patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral bi@@ polar or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin .
after the market launch , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported to decrease the visual acuity in diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is unclear whether there is a direct relationship between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be taken into consideration .
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and in case a patient wishes for a pregnancy or this occurs , treatment may be dis@@ car@@ ded ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies to investigate interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C from pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in AU@@ C from pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ cholester@@ ol@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increases the insulin resistance of the cervi@@ x , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not inv@@ alu@@ able from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ gate and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one AL@@ T asc@@ ents beyond thre@@ ef@@ old of the upper limit of the normal range were equally common as placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea .
in an outcome study in patients with pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported about heart failure in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one more frequently , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients were performed in the groups treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active trial running over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in case of taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared .
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which results in increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose tolerance in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy was continued for two years in order to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the start of the therapy a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three months of improvement with insulin were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical studies over one year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was studied in a small study of type 2 diabetes in a small , 18 @-@ week study .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo , a reduction in overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and a rise in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels and low , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced overall plas@@ mat@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or lic@@ la@@ cide , and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison to placebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels below Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while lower levels of met@@ form@@ in and lic@@ la@@ cide were observed .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post @-@ radi@@ al increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both through an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease in groups were random@@ ised to receive either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment .
after oral application , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy is equivalent to the triple of the efficacy of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
interaction studies have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the subjects ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination @-@ time of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the parent substance are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies were observed in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible excessive heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the decrease in the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , which reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( male and female rats ) and tumors ( male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ ac@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of color@@ ectal cancer .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study for two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or lic@@ la@@ cide were investigated .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post @-@ radi@@ al increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both through an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study lack@@ ed the target of its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , coron@@ ary re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one no cardiovascular risk of long @-@ term risks are associated .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side mark &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and of more than 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medication , increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women was observed .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use the insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
acet@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were similarly reduced with another human insulin .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
you may also need to adjust the doses of acet@@ ph@@ ane if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be removed from the package contents ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes out@@ weigh the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for placing Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice a day if a quick initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
for example , patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by intensified insulin therapy may be able to perceive the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in strength , brand ( producers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analogue ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage .
if a dosage adjustment is required when changing to acet@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , this can be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling to more than one time zone , the patient should be advised to catch the advice of his physician as such travels may cause insulin and meals to be taken or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken from them .
4 . both hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in un@@ controlled diabetes , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent dys@@ functions of the brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system - Periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement in blood sugar control can be associated with complaints called acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 . an intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood glucose adjustment can however be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue Ac@@ tu@@ ally - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection site can be a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if failed to change the inser@@ tions inside the injection area .
during insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) may occur during insulin therapy .
diseases of the immune system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ onic ede@@ ma , breathing difficulties , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and f@@ ain@@ ting / un@@ consciousness .
however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or via glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration amounts up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with rapid or delayed absorption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by spl@@ itting is active .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot reveal any particular danger to humans .
it is recommended to increase the temperature of the insulin to room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) after the Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane water bottle is taken out of the refrigerator before res@@ us@@ cu@@ ding according to the instructions for use .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken from them .

13 . an intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood glucose adjustment can however be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
the termin@@ ale half @-@ life ( t ½ ) is therefore more a measure of resor@@ ption than a measure of the elimination per se of the insulin out of the plasma ( insulin has a t ½ of just a few minutes ) .

ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
you may also need to adapt the doses of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for placing ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of quickly acting insulin must first be raised , followed by the amount of long acting insulin .
3 If a dosage adjustment is required when switching to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , this may be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before travelling to more than one time zone , the patient should be advised to catch the advice of his physician as such travels may cause insulin and meals to be taken or taken at other times .
5 General diseases and complaints at the administration of the administration - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) may occur .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or via glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients undergoing major surgical procedures showed that a 42 % reduction ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) was reduced by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total active duration amounts to about 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged 6 to 12 ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited , but suggest that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .
in@@ fusion systems with ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations 0.@@ 05 I.@@ U. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ E. / ml insulin humane in in@@ fusion fluids 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D@@ - Glu@@ cose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable in the use of in@@ fusion bags made of polypropylene at room temperature for 24 hours .
11 If a dosage adjustment is required in case of change to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , this can be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before travelling to more than one time zone , the patient should be advised to catch the advice of his physician as such travels may cause insulin and meals to be taken or taken at other times .

the intraven@@ ous application of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id from pre@@ pens or cartridges should be an exception and can only be carried out in situations where no pier@@ cing bottles are available .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , this can be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .

• Dis@@ inf@@ ect the rubber membrane with a medical swa@@ b • always use a new injection needle to avoid contamination . • Rem@@ ove the protective flap from a Nov@@ o@@ Fine injection needle • squee@@ ze the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Fig@@ ure A ) • Use the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
follow these steps to prevent the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle up • kno@@ ck a couple of times with your finger slightly against the cartridge .
while air bubbles are present , these will collect them up in the cartridge • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues to hold upwards , rotate the cartridge by one click in the direction of the arrow ( Fig@@ ure B ) • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues pointing upwards , press the pressure button thoroughly ( figure C ) • Now , a drop of insulin must leak from the tip of the injection needle .
• Set the closing cap to the finished pen using the number 0 opposite the metering brand ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Check if the press button is fully pressed .
if the push button cannot move freely , the insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the connection cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves out@@ wards while rotating the closing cap • The scale under the push button ( pressure button scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Record the highest number you can see on the push button • add the two numbers to get the selected dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the closing cap forward or backward until you have set the correct number of units .
rotate it until the push button is at the bottom and you feel a resistance . then turn off the closing cap and set it so again that the 0 of the metering brand is opposite .
make sure to press the button only during the injection • squee@@ ze the pressure button completely after the injection , until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
it may be in@@ accurate - you can &apos;t set a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge . you can use the remaining scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you can &apos;t use it to adjust or select your dose .

aden@@ omas are used in patients who are already showing signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or gou@@ ty notes ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger deposits of ur@@ anium , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still over 6 mg per week after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , sei@@ zur@@ es may still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that the patients take further medicines for the prevention of g@@ out sei@@ zur@@ es at least during the first six months .
the drug is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ omas ( once a day 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared with a placebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ medication ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ omas ( once a day 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year in 7@@ 62 patients .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of the patients who took Aden@@ ic in a dose of 80 mg once a day , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who received 120 mg once a day , measured a level of ur@@ ic acid in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients in Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in lowering the level of ur@@ ic acid in the blood , it was more effective than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to deposits ( including an illness known from the patient &apos;s history and / or rheum@@ atic arthritis ) .
if the serum term level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients .
since there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or chronic heart failure , the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other resin @-@ based medicines , acute g@@ out may occur during the treatment , because the reduction in the serum har@@ n@@ lei@@ c acid levels may first mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment ( Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) increase the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases so far that it has to be deposited in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat treatment begins and in the subsequent course ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was did not conduct any interaction studies on F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ one level ( an in@@ hibition of the metabol@@ isation of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous display of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat exposition ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / Var@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without the need for a dose adjustment for f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
in a study with subjects 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily showed an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , the magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and caused a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies may not include side effects of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ sty group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be found .
the risk factors in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ kler@@ otic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could be observed in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups , are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In the clinical trials no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
treatment related events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency :

mechanism of action ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and arises as part of the reaction ch@@ as@@ k@@ ade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → J@@ ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro in@@ hibition left below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point in each study was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly dose levels were &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine in@@ trin@@ sic value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ als &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summ@@ arized for analysis .
the lowering of the acid water level to &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the entire treatment .
in 50@@ 9 patients , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol received 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( ie . ) .
the primary efficacy end@@ point of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decline of serum concentrations in subjects regardless of kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum @-@ acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum hardness levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in incidence of g@@ out sei@@ zur@@ es , so that less than 3 % of the patients needed a treatment against a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not require any treatment against a gi@@ ra@@ ine ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the pla@@ ited no@@ des , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the g@@ th node by month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose proportional increase .
after taking ordinary or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.3 μ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum resin concentration , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id mainly arises through U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as imm@@ utable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion via urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found an unchanged F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
after taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal ren@@ al function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at declined approximately the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ g ⋅ yr / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ yr / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d @-@ Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication B ) Li@@ ver dysfunction , the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dose treated group , with approximately 11 @-@ fold exposure in humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
at high doses , which were about 4 @-@ times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied by a reduction in the re@@ aring performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not result in ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In the clinical trials no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
in the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the primary efficacy end@@ point in each study was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly dose levels were &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum hardness levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in incidence of g@@ out sei@@ zur@@ es , so that less than 3 % of the patients needed a treatment against a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not require any treatment against a gi@@ ra@@ ine ) .

according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline , an updated R@@ MP is a risk management system for human medicines with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
additionally , an update of the R@@ MP is required • when new information is available , which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk minim@@ ization activities • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of the E@@ MEA
in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble .
if you keep urine acid concentration low by taking the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the formation of the crystals is prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is achieved .
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C must not be taken , if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine , if you have a heart weakness or have or may suffer from any other heart problem . • If you are treated as a result of a high level of ur@@ ic acid concentration in the wake of a cancer illness or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disorder where there is too much ur@@ ic acid in your blood ) .
if you have an attack at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the drop is cleared before you start treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
this does not have to be with everyone , but could also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months when you are taking AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary , in order to prevent an attack or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently used / used it , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separately used in medicines which are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that suggests that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhea ( ul@@ cer@@ ation ) , s@@ wollen abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) as well as acid re@@ pul@@ sion .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any other component , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it must not be used in case of diseases of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot sit or sit for at least 30 minutes .
the European Commission issued a permit to the Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. company in January 2007 for the marketing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union .
capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of ge@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after day@@ time . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ ed@@ ings or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except p@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , can be given only with special care ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al lines , were reported in patients taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out in the occurrence of symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ viral pain or new or deterior@@ ating heart@@ burn to remedy the drug and seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of serious op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or continue taking it after symptoms that indicate bad @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cers , including some serious and associated with complications , were rarely reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men mainly administered intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there is no data available to indicate whether a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a max@@ illary surgery reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that if you miss a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , you should take the tablet next morning after you have noticed your failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but will continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the application of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy nor by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports date from cancer patients , but oste@@ opor@@ osis patients were also reported .
nevertheless , decreases in serum calcium to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / l ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate following an oral over@@ dose can be hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ mia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D@@ 3 ) Vitamin D@@ 3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the conversion of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ pl@@ as to Vitamin D@@ 3 .
the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is the increase of intestinal resor@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of serum calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption .
in severe cases , a deficiency of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ mia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ia can lead to increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic patients .

after 15 weeks of treatment , the mean serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly decreased the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency after 15 weeks ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs .
studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate The therapeutic equivalent of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multi@@ center study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III studies , the moderate asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg / day compared to placebo in 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur neck and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a 48 % reduction ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % compared to placebo was 6.2 % ) in the proportion of patients suffering one or more spinal frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D asc@@ ents of the spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to be maintained ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was also maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. a day for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the incidence of at least one new spinal frac@@ ture by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption concerning an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after a night fast and two hours before taking a standardised breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective when taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly disper@@ ses into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ eces .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance exceeded not 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs through these transport systems .
resor@@ ption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting and two hours before taking a meal , the mean area below serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D@@ 3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng / ml ( without taking into account endo@@ genous vitamin D@@ 3 levels ) .
the average maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D@@ 3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and medi@@ an time until reaching the maximum serum concentration ( max ) 12 hours .
biot@@ a formation Vitamin D@@ 3 is rapidly hydro@@ xi@@ ated in the liver to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 , and then met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
ex@@ cre@@ tion In the case of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy subjects , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the subjects after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients &quot; prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine .
although there is no clinical data about it , it is still to be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
in patients with reduced kidney function , there is an increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bone ( see Section 4.2 ) .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate Non @-@ clinical data based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , chronic toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential do not reveal any particular danger to humans .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f are already in use in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously performed studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , comparing Adv@@ agra@@ f with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after one year ( by examining , for example , how often a re @-@ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , more recent studies in 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were performed and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be used .
patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken simultaneously with Adv@@ agra@@ f as the Adv@@ agra@@ ph dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time has to be adapted accordingly .

only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dose ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be undertaken under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is maintained .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level rules ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on day 4 , the systemic exposure measured as a level mirror was comparable with both form@@ ulations in both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated inspections of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks following transplan@@ t under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ clearing substance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ ph dose scheme may take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral consumption of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application For suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ance therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient following the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplantation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be a transplan@@ t receiver of twice daily dose of Progra@@ f Cap@@ sul@@ es to a once daily intake of Adv@@ ant@@ ool , so this change@@ over is to be done at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose .
after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ ant@@ y@@ Once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection must begin daily .
heart transplan@@ t For adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and intestinal transplan@@ ted patients , performed in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in p@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ly transplan@@ ted patients at an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage Adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood @-@ tal@@ lies in the targeted area can be required for patients with severe liver dysfunction to reduce the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum incre@@ as levels , a calculation of the in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ ants and a monitoring of the ur@@ ination volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f With the conversion from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ to to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the blood level in full blood The dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases by using whole @-@ blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks following transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ ent , Dos@@ age adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ sal blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicinal product with a low clearance , adjustments to the dose may require several days before the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the indications in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the level of seb@@ um in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in thorou@@ gh@@ bred in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and cardiac transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur in consequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub @-@ exposure or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dose ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be undertaken under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f is available for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adults with adult heart transplan@@ ts and gra@@ ft recipients .
because of possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) .
a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood is offered in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea because the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Progra@@ f , a hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed under Progra@@ f , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f as well .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor .
if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headaches , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and vision disturbances , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f includes hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , special caution is required in patients with the rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level while simultaneously offering substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage to maintain consistent concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction with anti@@ fung@@ al infections such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels was primarily due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; hence , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormone exposure , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for any adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant is often not determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
the side effects listed below are listed in descending order : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .

cases of BK @-@ virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal Leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in conjunction with treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not be di@@ aly@@ zed .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ kin genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cells ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

175 patients , with 4@@ 75 patients who had undergone a pancre@@ atic transplantation and in 6@@ 30 patients treated as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive in 6@@ 30 patients .
overall , the safety profile of oral program in these published studies was consistent with the large studies in which Progra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with liver , kidney and cardiac transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis over a recent , multi @-@ center study with oral program , more than 110 patients were reported that received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in in 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ - syndrome , was seen less frequently in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus it occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of cases to develop bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of chronic bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
a multi @-@ center study with oral program was performed in 205 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation , receiving a random@@ ised trial of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to reach the target levels of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
color@@ ectal cancer The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral program as the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive after color@@ ectal cancer showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism induced by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ances observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly occurs via the g@@ all .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than Progra@@ f for stable patients who were converted from Progra@@ f ( twice daily ) to the total daily allowance .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks following transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .

Adv@@ ent is used to treat and prevent ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital heart defect caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Adv@@ ent is used to treat hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges or to prevent ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that em@@ powers it to the formation of the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain any human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges as well as surgical interventions .
in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ ent in the prevention of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood episodes was &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; well &quot; evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) include di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VI@@ II .
it may not be used in patients who are hyper@@ sensitive to the human scent factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for placing Adv@@ ate in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and extent of bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or more repeat until the pain and the acute impairment are eliminated .
repeat all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the course of treatment , adequate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended to control the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VI@@ II , reach different in vi@@ vo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ value .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis On long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma is not reached or if bleeding is not controlled at a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ or values , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be weighed .
the administration speed should be directed after finding the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against Factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II @-@ directed Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ or development , following conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ inver@@ ted ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences concerning the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s experienced in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors to factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the total of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected decrease of the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II @-@ level was observed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the day and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - levels in the plasma and the clearing rate again showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 145 children and adults 2 with a diagnosis of severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days .
in addition , none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated inhibit@@ ors to factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and an ongoing peak of the antibody level for anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a C@@ of@@ actor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre@@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( bas@@ eline factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive , but has taken into consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , based on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , the CH@@ MP has decided to apply for another extension procedure within 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited granted the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) to allow the company to withdraw its application for the advent of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer .
usually , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures within the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been altered so that it does not produce any copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumors , enabling the cancer cells to recre@@ ate the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and kill the cells if DNA cannot be recovered .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is defective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer occurred in the area of the under@@ belly , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had reviewed the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the initial documents submitted , the CH@@ MP grants 120 a list of questions sent to the company .
the CH@@ MP opinion was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore provides benefits for patients .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be established in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the Company did not know the CH@@ MP about whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ pre@@ h@@ ensive &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altered agent release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages caused by allergies ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and children over 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet , which is to be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are clari@@ fied .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can cause con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when viewing all hay fever symptoms except for con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was examined , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who were not alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) include ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( som@@ nia ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other components , anti @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ re@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine used to treat allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients suffering from con@@ genital glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases including hyper@@ ton@@ ia , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( cereb@@ ral over@@ function ) , or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze to the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing it , cr@@ ushing or ch@@ ew ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of absence due to lack of data on the safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end .
it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days , as long @-@ term use can reduce the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors respectively within 2 weeks of termination of such treatment .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ oline , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ aph@@ rag@@ m etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient population and the data is not sufficient to verb@@ alize appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze has not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ ton@@ ia or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headache or strengthening of headache ) must be removed .
patients with heart rhythm disorders • Pati@@ ents with a heart rhythm disorders • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck construction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise avoid positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent .
in the context of clinical tests with des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions were observed or alterations of the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test did not reveal any significant differences between patients treated with placebo and placebo treated patients regardless of whether they were taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ ene has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not in@@ hibited and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate is nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a drow@@ sin@@ ess , which can lead to impairment of the traffic jam or the ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ val processes .
headaches , anxiety , difficult mi@@ sts , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre @-@ cor@@ di@@ ale pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth drought , pup@@ il stiff@@ ness and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin ery@@ thema , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ed@@ ophil@@ s as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesive molecule P @-@ Selec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
during a single dose study with adults , Des@@ i@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ athetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure , a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ ist effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall score for the symptoms ( except the nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine for the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the plasma is administered .
following the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze for healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow balance of des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached in day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four test subjects were poorly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the exclusive gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is bio@@ equivalent to exposure to an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ ci@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of lau@@ com@@ am@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application , the pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets can relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and drow@@ ning or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
20 Under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the swelling of the medicine on the gin@@ gi@@ val tissue , containing pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine .
( diabetes ) , a sten@@ osis of ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cers , a closure of the stomach or du@@ oden@@ um ( bow@@ el closure ) , a bladder neck closure , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the history of the stomach ( short@@ ness of breath due to a cra@@ mp of the lung mus@@ cul@@ ature ) , a prostate enlargement , or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder .
tell your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnos@@ ing the following symptoms or diseases under the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • Blood pressure • heart ch@@ asing , heart beat • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headache , or strengthening existing headaches .
if you take aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
the recommended dosage is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or decreases attention .
if you have taken a greater amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a greater amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
heart hunt , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n it was very rare to report cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash .
cases of heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disturbances , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , in cases of inflammation of the liver and cases of abnormal liver strains has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for taking ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup .
for children aged one to five , the dose is 1,@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup and / or sy@@ rup .
for children between the ages of six and eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by finding the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rants , impairment of sleep and performance in days ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom score by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % among the patients who received a placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ re@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe to transfer A@@ eri@@ us to the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience in clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease process and can be terminated after the symptoms end and resum@@ ed after re@@ occurring .
during the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( onset of symptoms in 4 days or more days a week and over 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during the allergy time a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were given additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impairment of the traffic jam or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us daily than in patients treated with placebo .
the most frequent side effects reported more frequently than placebo reported ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical trial of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most frequent side effect was headache , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose trial administered up to 45 mg of des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ed@@ ophil@@ s as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesive molecule P @-@ Selec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ i@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal fluid and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was sub@@ stituted for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , not@@ withstanding the eti@@ ology of the different forms , is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily .
as hist@@ amine removal is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that in addition to Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria will lead to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rants at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study .
an improvement in the stimulus rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with placebo compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ ci@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available to support an infectious Rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin investigations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed for des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher levels of substance ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children , which are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug should not use this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were given additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group , similar to placebo .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose was 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ ci@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children aged 1 to 11 who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged 1 to 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged 6 to 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ ci@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which des@@ ci@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents diagnosed at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
during a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents did not affect psych@@ om@@ otor impair@@ ments in clinical trials .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not result in increasing alcohol @-@ induced loss of performance or an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rants at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) by des@@ ci@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life time of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation once daily use of des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In a number of single dose studies , di@@ aly@@ x and C@@ MA@@ x values were comparable to pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with the recommended doses compared to those of adults who received des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ ene has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bre@@ ading bottles with child @-@ proof polypropylene connection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated and documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ i@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets put in your mouth once a day , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience in clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet is removed without damaging them .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of the adverse events between the dou@@ rup@@ - and placebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
at the recommended dosage , A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s enam@@ el tablet proved to be bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ at for the formulation of des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

during a single dose study with adults , Des@@ i@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poorly metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ at .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets offer the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children , which are normal met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with heredi@@ tary problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ omer@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group .
in children between 6 and 23 months , the most frequent side effects reported were diar@@ rhea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , a single dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution for taking no side effects in patients aged 6 to 11 was observed .
in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may , depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. announced the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company res@@ umes its application for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the stem ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from person to person , because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
when the vaccine is administered , the immune system recogn@@ ises the parts of the flu virus present in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to form rapid antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this stem .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface detected by the human body as foreign body ) was puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
inspection from some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base was insufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who are not able to swallow the capsules , as@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution , but it cannot be taken together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
as@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus will respond to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti @-@ viral drugs .
for children between the ages of 4 and 12 , and for patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on the body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and therefore also the development of infection and disease related to AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , which was fortified with low dose , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the alterations in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml compared to placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few responded to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicine A@@ gener@@ ase enhanced the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase combined with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to decrease the viral load after four weeks than with the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) include headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are broken down as well as as@@ gener@@ ase and are inj@@ ected in high concentrations in the blood to health detri@@ mental .
as with other medicines against HIV , patients who are taking A@@ gener@@ ase have the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syn@@ dro@@ mes ( symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years out@@ weigh the risks .
as@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for placing as@@ gener@@ ase in the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 years .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , a@@ general capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the increased addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be used .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body@@ weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use should be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ ion enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to reduced plasma concentrations and reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of trans@@ mitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcomes .
for the case of con@@ current anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show increased frequency of liver function disorders under anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored in line with clinical practice .
simultaneous use of am@@ per@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of v@@ ast@@ atin with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients taking this medication at the same time , as@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however , the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on ov@@ ary withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are also administered .
due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this form of dosage is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with care in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus were reported .
many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy medicines were needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. increased age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( Type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ at@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resident opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of initiation of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) which leads to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi @-@ fac@@ torial ae@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Sub@@ strate with a low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width plus sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ ion enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase in other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were frequently observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus levels and , if possible , check the viral load and dep@@ ose the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increases , however , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % ab@@ ase when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , achieved in combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is recommended close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study for the use of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ o@@ in was carried out , but due to the attached component of Di@@ dan@@ o@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ o@@ in and as@@ gener@@ ase lie at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in possibly lowers the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
should these drugs be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ a@@ virus may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed because precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and p@@ inion to Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
the simultaneous injection of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19.@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster a ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma around 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can possibly interact with interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs when used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase as it can cause resor@@ ption dysfunction .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to degradation of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ col@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
the simultaneous intake of as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the side @-@ effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) more than 7 days in subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous addition of am@@ per@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the possible benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to have pronounced increases in plasma levels while ad@@ minist@@ ering as@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is present ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be used together with or@@ ally taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while caution is required while using as@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors indicate possible increase in Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am plasma levels by 3 to 4 fa@@ xes .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ato@@ sis , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are also administered .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation is currently available , such as am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be adjusted with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended while ap@@ ital@@ ase is present ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected in the milk lac@@ tose @-@ related rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to people in breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not impaired by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely leading to treatment .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether or not they are related to the use of as@@ gener@@ ase or another drug used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below come from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients who have not treated prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication , were performed in more than 1 % of the patients , and laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are performed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and bilateral sub@@ cut@@ aneous fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ sal pel@@ vic fat accumulation .
in 113 patients treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine after 36 weeks , only one case was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , in 2 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre@@ treated patients with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 patients ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients in In@@ d@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or macro@@ por@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment had to be canc@@ eled with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resident opportun@@ istic infections at the time of introduction of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the case of PI @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice daily with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; an exception were the rise in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which were very common in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low dose of p@@ inion .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is expected to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures can be initiated .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the process of viral gene and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ es@@ pres@@ sions with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dosage , the mut@@ ations described in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were rarely observed with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral @-@ untreated patients who received 700@@ mg f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients enrolled with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / L , I@@ 47@@ V , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its pro@@ long@@ ation AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure more than 96 weeks , following the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance testing gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F /
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic patterns associated with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data for cross resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral @-@ untreated patients , in which a F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ates ) appear .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early abor@@ tion of an ad@@ minist@@ ering therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the test@@ ament to the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which adult treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and a standard of care ( SO@@ C ) with PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , &quot; received .
a hundred thre@@ es@@ core and sixty ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI have been included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ inferior threshold of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ ble@@ ached A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and capsules of 15 mg / kg was three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low d@@ osed p@@ inion was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks about 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline .
19 Based on this data , therapeutic optimisation should be taken into consideration when treating PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase .
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x lowered by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimal concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as a un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than the capsules ; hence as@@ gener@@ ase solution and a@@ general capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram @-@ basis .
the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those who are achieved twice daily at healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas in male animals showed ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages , corresponding to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , revealed little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo and In @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse @-@ mut@@ ations test , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymph@@ oma were contained , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
no significant liver toxic@@ ity has yet been observed in clinical studies , neither during administration nor after the end of treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the mice and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in a systemic plasma exposition which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the increased addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be used .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body@@ weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use should be performed in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction with care , in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increases , however , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , achieved in combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is recommended close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed because precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and p@@ inion to Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster a ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ col@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , n@@ ano@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
in a clinical trial where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) more than 7 days in subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of nor@@ eth@@ in@@ toxic@@ ology ) led to an increase in AU@@ C and C@@ min by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is expected to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures can be initiated .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , therapeutic optimisation should be taken into consideration when treating PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; ag@@ ro@@ ase .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .

studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the mice and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the metabol@@ isation paths are not yet fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking in is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ co@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution has been demonstrated neither in patients treated with PI patients nor with PI previously treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , a@@ general capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution to stop taking ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dosage for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since there is no recommended dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and low dose of the rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient populations .
although a dosage adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content , A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking children under 4 years is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabol@@ isation of these medicines and potentially cause severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including the treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of trans@@ mitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be set in the long term if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( Type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ at@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis .
it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increases , however , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the simultaneous intake of as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase associated side effects with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
on the basis of data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are significantly higher following oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is unknown . as@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ co@@ l contained ( see Section 4.3 ) .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected in the milk lac@@ tose @-@ related rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to people in breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 55 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether or not they are related to the use of as@@ gener@@ ase or another drug used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dosage , the mut@@ ations described in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were rarely observed with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the early aband@@ on@@ ment of an ad@@ minist@@ ering 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
62 Based on this data , therapeutic optimisation should be taken into consideration when treating PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large c@@ ousin volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

it may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
your doctor will usually instruc@@ t you to use as@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect of as@@ gener@@ ase .
the use of as@@ gener@@ ase is based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor for you and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you suffer from one of the above @-@ mentioned illnesses or take any of the drugs mentioned above .
if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure that before starting the treatment you have carefully read the use information on Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
similarly , there is no sufficient information available to recommend the application of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to ampli@@ fy the effectiveness of children aged 4 to 12 years or in general in patients under 50 kg body weight .
therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines , &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ ase .
− It may require additional factor VI@@ II to control an@@ a@@ emia . − For patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat can occur .
if you use certain medicines that can lead to serious side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , and war@@ far@@ in , at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase , your doctor may carry out additional blood tests to minimize possible safety problems .
it is recommended that HIV @-@ positive women should not breast@@ feed their children under any circumstances in order to prevent HIV transmission .
transport and operation of machinery There were no studies on the influence of as@@ gener@@ ase on driving ability or the ability to operate machinery .
please use this medicine only after consultation with your doctor if it is known that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
if you are taking Di@@ dan@@ o@@ in , it is advisable that you take it more than an hour before or after as@@ gener@@ ase , otherwise the effects of as@@ gener@@ ase can be reduced .
dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
if your doctor decides that taking rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will need to take higher doses ( 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
85 So it is very important that you take the entire daily dose prescribed by your doctor .
if you have taken a larger amount of as@@ gener@@ ase than you should , if you have taken more than the prescribed dose of as@@ gener@@ ase , you should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately .
if you forgot to take A@@ gener@@ ase , take it as soon as you think about it and continue taking it as before .

other ingredients are propylene gly@@ co@@ l , macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( polyethylene gly@@ co@@ l 400 ) , to@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( T@@ P@@ GS ) , sodium chlori@@ de , artificial gum Trau@@ ben@@ - aroma , natural pe@@ pper@@ mint flavor , le@@ om@@ en@@ tho@@ l , cit@@ ric acid , cit@@ ric acid , puri@@ fied water .
the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depends on the disease to be treated : • Al@@ dar@@ a is to be performed three times a week in case of cow@@ ards in the genital area . • In case of small cell carcin@@ omas , it is performed three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment , with a break between the treatment courses three times a week .
before bed@@ time , apply the cream to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before being washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream but without the active agent ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with genital war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where the patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tumors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies involving a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . in the treatment of patients in the genital area , the total healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with placebo . • Results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p for immuno@@ competent adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is continued until all visible signs of the genital or per@@ ine@@ al canal have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
a break in the treatment course described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if in follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated lesi@@ ons are completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and cover in the puri@@ fied , infected skin area until the cream is fully absorbed .
these patients should be weighed out between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a balance between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a stri@@ k@@ tur leading to circumcision .
an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , serious local skin irrit@@ ations were also observed in rare cases , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the output of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine requiring emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous means for treatment of external infections in the genital and perio@@ don@@ tal area there are no clinical experiences until now .
although limited data suggests an increased rate of inclin@@ ation reductions in HIV positive patients , i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the cow@@ ards .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line has not been studied .
local skin reactions are common but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during the therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment period of several days can be done .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there is currently no data available for long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered in case of super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there is no clinical experience in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs . therefore , the use of pre @-@ treated tumours is not recommended .
data from an open clinical trial suggest that large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower probability of response to i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the Li@@ p .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses in anatom@@ ical areas outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data about the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions normal@@ y decrease in intensity in the course of the therapy or go back after the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if local skin reactions cause major discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 ac@@ - lesi@@ ons showed a lower complete cure rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .
due to immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with care in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
from animal studies no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / f@@ öt@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development emerge ( see 5.3 ) .
although no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) have been achieved either once or after repeated topical application , no recommendation can be given to the application during breast@@ feeding .
the most common adverse events reported and possibly or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions in the treatment of inclin@@ ation war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the placebo @-@ controlled placebo @-@ controlled placebo @-@ controlled placebo @-@ controlled placebo @-@ controlled placebo @-@ controlled bas@@ ali@@ oma patients were shown below .
the most common adverse event , probably or possibly associated with the application of i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in relation to side effects , were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects indicated in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream are listed below .
these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream frequently resulted in local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , exposure / sc@@ rap@@ ing / sc@@ rap@@ ing ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) .
the evaluation of clinical signs presented according to the test plan shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently resulted in severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe erosion ( 13 % ) , and severe de@@ formation and im@@ pregn@@ ation ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ adver@@ tent oral recording of 200 mg i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
clinical severe side effects , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , existed in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , norm@@ alized after oral or IV fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha interference and other cy@@ tok@@ ines have been detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , it was possible to demonstrate that efficacy in response to a complete healing of the inclin@@ ation in an i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is superior .
in 60 % of the 119 patients who had treated I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients treated completely ; this was the case at 20 % of the 105 patients who had been treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
total healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 male patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in five times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tumors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super @-@ ectable bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic action lesi@@ ons within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ comfortably scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods .
in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , the approved indications utter@@ ances of pron@@ unci@@ ation , ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ osis and super@@ fici@@ ency bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a creme was studied in four random@@ ised double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more ) .
minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three @-@ three weekly treatment for 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml when applied in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 single bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25@@ mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated obvious half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this points to an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od to topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of CG led to significantly lowered body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study on the der@@ mal application for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year @-@ old study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumors in the application .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for the human being is regarded as very low due to the systemic exposure .
the tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the effective free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with inferior U@@ VR .
it may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
● F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) , which have formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itali@@ a ( sexual organs ) and anus ( anus ) ● superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma . this is a frequently encountered , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very little likel@@ ihood of spreading to other parts of the body .
if it remains untreated , it can lead to ab@@ norm@@ alities , especially in the face - so early detection and treatment are important .
ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses are harsh areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to sunlight during their life .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used for flat ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that al@@ dar@@ a is the most appropriate treatment for you .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to the brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not de@@ composed and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , which complic@@ ate movements , reduced lung volume , heart and eye disease .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alization equipment , and patients may need medicines to prevent allergic reaction .

the study mainly examined the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was measured ( by examining its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and shi@@ vers .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known and , if necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients receiving Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to transfer Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long term enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes in individual steps .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only occur in a reasonable clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ alization facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 trial , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with care when applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , it is necessary to cau@@ ti@@ ously proceed as a result of the theoretical increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment .
60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to be treated in order to minimize the potential incidence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the case of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed again by reducing the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate where the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
animal experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 or older at a duration of up to 4 years , are shown in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly severe form and duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients had a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ical ren@@ dition within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with a more severe form of mac@@ ular circulation in the patients under 5 years of age ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or to premature ex@@ cre@@ tion from the study ) 13 / 45 patients had no immuno@@ hist@@ ochem@@ istry ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say revealed antibodies , including 3 patients with whom it never came to ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version .
patients with a lack of antibody levels had a robust lowering of the G@@ AG level in the urine , while a variable reduction of G@@ AG@@ s in urine was observed in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low inhibit@@ ing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic som@@ atic activity in vitro , which did not seem to imp@@ air clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG@@ s in urine .
the presence of antibodies didn &apos;t seem to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulative sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that showed the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and ability of hearing in the following table .
the open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically non @-@ significant over this period and the absolute pulmon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ Atom@@ ic acid before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size up to the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear decrease of the G@@ AG level in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was observed that remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous manifestation of the disease between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , clin@@ ically significant changes were observed for five efficacy variables ( expected percentage of patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ long open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion ( 16 patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients , the dose was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - M@@ irr@@ ors in week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined after the Z @-@ score for this age group . the younger patients with the severe follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation only limited or no progress could be observed in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , research into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regi@@ mens on the G@@ AG level in the urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute walk were carried out .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged less than 5 years was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with a unique gift , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data will not reveal any particular danger to the human being .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in patients who have previously not been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received chemotherapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent a liquid deficiency ) should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood picture changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed thus s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from spl@@ itting .
converting P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of active form of the drug and longer active life in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared to the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months on the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed longer survival times than with the comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union .
each water bottle must be dissolved with a 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for predomin@@ ant hard disk epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the reduction in frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid in the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed offering as well as the day after the treatment .
during the seven days preceding the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must continue during the whole therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) a week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients who receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood picture should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a plat@@ el@@ et count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ G@@ PT ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place taking account of the na@@ di@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of previous treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
if patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o- or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity Grade 3 or 4 occurs or so forth at the incidence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , in comparison to patients aged 65 , there is an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min , which could go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ fold the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied specifically in the studies .
patients must be monitored with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again reaches ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was moist@@ ened if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed need to be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce the treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients for whom a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid retention in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment is to be weighed .
5 abnormal cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed if this drug was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage of the reproductive capacity is due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment plan to obtain advice concerning sperm conservation .
high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g. daily ) can lead to reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of increased occurrence of side effects in patients with normal kidney function ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) .
therefore caution is necessary if high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or a@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in high doses in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed must be avoided .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for pregnant women , but as with an@@ aero@@ bic An@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy except when necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed exceeds the breast milk and unwanted effects on breast @-@ fed infants cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the incidence and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and the random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
side effects Frequ@@ ency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , ≥ 1 / 1000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) .

for this table a threshold of 5 % was specified regarding the inclusion of all events in which the advis@@ ing doctor considered a connection with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for possible .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC tok@@ ens reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed included ar@@ rhyth@@ mia and motor neu@@ rop@@ athy .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 26@@ 5 patients who received random@@ ized p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as mon@@ otherapy with the addition of fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as well as 27@@ 6 patients who were random@@ ised to opt for doc@@ et@@ axel as mon@@ otherapy .

for this table a threshold of 5 % was specified regarding the inclusion of all events in which the rec@@ eding physician held a connection with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for possible .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC tok@@ ens , reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ized p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity degrees 3 and 4 was similar to the Phase 2 combination of three single P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ mono@@ therapies ( n = 164 ) , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the incidence and sever@@ ity of adverse events that could be associated with the study medicine ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSCLC who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 8@@ 30 patients with NSCLC who were random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

for this table , a threshold of 5 % was set for the inclusion of all events in which the rec@@ eding physician retained a connection with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity related to ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( commonly reported ) of patients receiving random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed include :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received ran@@ - dom@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed included :
serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks have been reported in hospitals , which are usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug , occasionally reported .
from clinical studies , cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ation , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) were reported in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
from clinical studies , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency were reported in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
there have been reported cases of acute ren@@ al failure in mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radi@@ otherapy in patients treated before , during or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy were reported ( see section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ torture , which exercises its effect by interrup@@ ting important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies show that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed acts as an anti@@ torture with multiple targets by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ synthesis ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ b@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , single @-@ blind Phase 3 study by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma demonstrated that with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin treated patients had a clin@@ ically meaningful benefit of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month extended survival compared to those patients who were only treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the treatment arm in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was demonstrated in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the single c@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms resulted from an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , open Phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA for doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was medi@@ an survival time of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival benefit fell in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ disk epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine , C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of NSCLC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .

dissolve the content of 100 mg water bottles with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preservatives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed .

the resulting solution is clear and the colouring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the production quality .
it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with low @-@ calorie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and do not receive weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in food , thereby causing approximately a quarter of the fats which have been added to the food un@@ healthy to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared with placebo in 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg in taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with fa@@ eces , fa@@ eces , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( f@@ eces ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in gra@@ ft patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it must also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or on chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( BM@@ I body mass index ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ical , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only resor@@ bed to minimal absorption , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for older and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • chol@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or high @-@ fat diet .
as weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting treatment with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adjusted if necessary .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended that additional pregn@@ ancies take place in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international normal @-@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
most patients who had been treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years stayed the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta @-@ carot@@ ene in the normal range .
however , it should be recommended to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure a sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decline in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
the frequency of known side effects noted after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown as these events have been reported voluntarily by a population of in@@ certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to conver@@ sions regarding possible and actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
most of the reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing were reported either with no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on humans and animals , a rapid back @-@ up of possible systemic effects can be assumed that can be traced back to the li@@ pass@@ inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect is based on the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper thin intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonds to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ ati@@ cal li@@ pas@@ es .
from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at was taken three times a day , blocking the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ical , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameters , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those participating in study , who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their bas@@ eline weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight loss was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
average cholesterol in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin stood with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % with or@@ list@@ at ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in waist measurements was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , in therapeutic doses , not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma was only spor@@ adi@@ c and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
two major metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ tic ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ cine @-@ group ) , were identified in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients , which displayed approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be seen as a danger to humans .

alo@@ xi@@ o is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is insufficient information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies Alo@@ xi was studied at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate vom@@ iting for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . it was approved by Alo@@ xi in the European Union .
al@@ oh@@ a is inde@@ xed : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute ion after injection should be closely monitored .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required if pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is present with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tumour activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics examined ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ t@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ steady @-@ concentration of oral met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( am@@ i@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , c@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not exist , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
clinical trials were the most common side effects of a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least might be associated with Alo@@ xi , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the appointment ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis trials were carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective treatment for al@@ op@@ ic over@@ dosing .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients who received moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cephal@@ os@@ in and &gt; 25 mg / m2 dose phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 doc@@ x or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 m@@ g. of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life time 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given , which was given intraven@@ ously at day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the study with moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the E@@ KG effects of a pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations , a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron dose 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) compared to a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of 0,@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ off dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies for metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the is@@ ovi@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams per kilogra@@ m &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered agent made about 40 % of the given dose .
the total number of patients was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance of 53 ± 29 ml / min after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bore injection .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination hormone and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction in dose is therefore not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects have been observed only after expos@@ ures , which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies evidence suggests that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and prolon@@ gs the period of action .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was equal to approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily for two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is considered to be low for the human being .

June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative opinion in which the failure of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug @-@ sensitive component that has already been approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue damages damages , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood are increased .
it is produced by a yeast that converts a gene ( DNA ) to stimulate the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that prove the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of the reference medical .
the study evaluated how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after treatment of the treatment responded to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@
furthermore , concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the drug and of the drugs to be marketed will not be sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon the disease appeared again in more patients than with the reference drug ; Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the question of the extent to which the medicine forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) is not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been det@@ ectable or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not have an effect against this type of infection .
alt@@ ar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin surface to be treated should not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies the percentage of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients in placebo were responding to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at home wound , about 90 % of patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ei@@ ter@@ ated cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections that have been det@@ ectable or presumably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irritation on the surface .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weighed in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. a permit for the import of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of an awareness @-@ raising or serious local irritation by applying sa@@ am@@ in@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment the treatment should be canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected area occurs after 2 to 3 days of treatment .
the effect of the simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ inn@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the middle sa@@ am@@ in@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ur@@ in@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on sk@@ inn@@ ed skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adap@@ tations are not considered necessary if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are in@@ sufficiently related to an impact on birth and fo@@ etal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefits of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy should be weighed for the woman .
in clinical studies in 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that used Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect irritation was at the ad@@ jun@@ c@@ tive site , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ur@@ in@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ ang@@ eri@@ anus ( earlier Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ tick @-@ anus ) .
the effective mechanism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub @-@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the transfer of pe@@ p@@ tide , blocking partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevents the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms may seem question@@ able , advice by experts should be sought .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of non @-@ response to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ur@@ am@@ ul@@ in o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on sc@@ ented skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling procedure took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake of people after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ in@@ ked skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ur@@ in@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites of retin@@ am@@ in@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .

Ambi@@ isco is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged one to 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , and a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , Ambi@@ ent may only be used if there is a small risk of hepatitis B infection while imm@@ uni@@ zing , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan existing out of two doses may end .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose of hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines work by &quot; bringing &quot; the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defense ) , as it can fight against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogn@@ ises the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ ination approved since 1996 and since 1997 approved V@@ acc@@ ine Twin@@ rix Children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and tw@@ ins are given children within the framework of a vacc@@ ination schedule consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence of Ambi@@ isco &apos;s application .
the main indicator for efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection .
in an additional 20@@ 8 children study , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ ć performed between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ ent &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ isco ( observed in over 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain on the injection site , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ation ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smi@@ th@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company .
the standardis@@ ation plan for the pri@@ me@@ val di@@ mm@@ ation with Ambi@@ ent consists of two doses of vacc@@ ines , the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a re@@ fres@@ her creation is desired for both Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis A antibodies ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) have been found in the same scale as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured that immuno@@ competent persons who have responded to a hepatitis A vaccine will need a re@@ fres@@ her vacc@@ ination as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should be available immediately for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction following the administration of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units form @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons suffering from disorders of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value under certain circumstances , so that in these cases the administration of further doses of vacc@@ ines may be required .
since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ in@@ efficacy , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders Ambi@@ ent can be inj@@ ected as an exception , as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding .
if Ambi@@ intoler@@ ance was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or combined with a combined mass m@@ um@@ ps re@@ inde@@ er , the immune response was adequate to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it is necessary that no adequate immune response may be achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever similar to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ om@@ age and preserv@@ ative formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ ent were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , Ambi@@ ent &apos;s tolerance was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation on a comp@@ ut@@ ational basis per vacc@@ ination Ambi@@ ent , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of subjects compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects according to the dose of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of subjects who had received Ambi@@ ent reported pain , compared with 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable to a pro@@ band ( i.e. about the total vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects who received Ambi@@ isco , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ tious group was comparable to that observed in combination with the three @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA @-@ units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ intoler@@ ance a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose injection schem@@ as with the combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years , serum rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the dose rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ isco and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ eity was evalu@@ able , the rate of ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection ( SP in the table below ) was significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine was significantly higher than with Ambi@@ isco .
the immune responses , which were reached in a clinical comparative study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose injection plan with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose injection scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in persons who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ ming , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study was comparable to that observed after ino@@ cul@@ ation of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA @-@ units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose @-@ volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies was comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
when the first dose of Ambi@@ intoler@@ ance was administered at the same time as a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined mass m@@ um@@ ps @-@ m@@ um@@ ps @-@ ra@@ dish vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formula in adults showed similar levels of ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates similar to the previous formulation .
both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ se , the vaccine can be examined for any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as water contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ents .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ intoler@@ ance cannot be completely protected from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child has already been infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines ( although you / your child will not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of the vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections affecting the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend three inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) .
the second dose of this vaccine with reduced amounts of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and will give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the vaccine is stopped .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected by people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weak due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s defense / or if you / your child is undergoing a ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction is to vacc@@ ination .
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you are taking other medications ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or have received immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or is planned or planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ ent , it should be ino@@ cul@@ ated in separate places and as many limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
typically , Ambi@@ ani is not given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
please inform your doctor if an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) has been shown to you / your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ A very common ( more than 1 case per 10 inj@@ ected cans ) : • pain or discomfort on the inser@@ tion point or redness • Mat@@ ching • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ A frequency ( up to one case per 10 inj@@ ected ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Fe@@ zz@@ iness • gastro@@ intestinal disorders
other side effects that have been reported very rarely days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 inj@@ ected doses ) are :
these include locally restricted or broad strokes that may be it@@ ching or sp@@ lash @-@ like , swelling of the eyes and the face , start@@ ling breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .

23 . notify your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you / your child or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ ent is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which have become known since the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP argued that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ ent remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ ent has only been placed in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with complete enz@@ ym@@ atic defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia @-@ mic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high am@@ moni@@ ac@@ al concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is - split up to several individual doses of meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ ia esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube ) or a nose probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study because am@@ mon@@ ses could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without active substance ) .
ammon@@ ia may also lead to loss of appetite , an abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste sa@@ vor , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disrup@@ tions of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high am@@ moni@@ ac@@ al levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because limited information on this drug was limited due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete lack of enzyme in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enz@@ ym@@ atic defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for use in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake necessary for the growth and development of the patient &apos;s daily protein intake .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ ic@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ ac@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency should receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty in swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk of the development of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not reach the stomach right away .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used with care in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
as metabol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ VO should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
the importance of these findings in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the human being in the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during breast@@ feeding is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ VO , at least 56 % of patients experienced at least one adverse event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ VO ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal patient which developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate power , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dosing occurred at a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10@@ g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which in an intraven@@ ous dose of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that a sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate that is taken for each gram is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gly@@ glut@@ amine .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the earliest manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ ga .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative routes of nit@@ rous elimination ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ um ( however within the first life month ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease had been diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ ac@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is enz@@ ym@@ atic in the liver and kidneys , in which phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gly@@ glut@@ amine is produced .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis by up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients for intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were determined .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycli@@ c disturbances or hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting .
three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) were five times higher than after the first gifts in the plasma gas concentration on the third day .
the medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys within 24 hours of about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no more toxic effects in the rats treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( study 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules are taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who can not swallow tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ enter@@ i@@ es@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ ic@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ ac@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ VO gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat fl@@ utes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before birth , lesi@@ ons in the pyrami@@ ds of the brain cor@@ tex occurred .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ VO ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal patient which developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate power , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disrup@@ tions in the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that a sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate that is taken for each gram is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gly@@ glut@@ amine .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ulate form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were determined 15 minutes after taking .
during the duration of shelf life , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins .
if you carry out laboratory tests , you must tell the doctor that you are using AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ VO with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine could move into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste disturbances , impaired hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were also observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency department of your hospital in order to initiate a corresponding treatment .
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ VO , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

• Take from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • Range a straight edge , e.g. a knife edge over the top of the knife @-@ spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon equal to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of gran@@ ulates from the container .
angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , decreased blood flow to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ot@@ ox@@ in was compared with the normal combination treatment with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent the closure ) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as c@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S angi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year .
in patients who underwent a PCI , Angi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in with respect to all indicators , except for severe bleeding in which it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine , or any of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , as well as in people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox in the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to transfer angi@@ ox across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency intervention or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out subsequently , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery will be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , an input of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0,@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous IV in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us @-@ administration of angi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt input of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed prior to the application and the dose should be administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is given properly .
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose must be tested again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the addition of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment on average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 Pati@@ ents with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the IV administration of un@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• severe hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients , or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to mal@@ functioning of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine is given in combination with another an@@ tigen ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if the majority of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur in the case of PCI patients , most bleeding in arter@@ ial points of pun@@ cture can occur in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment generally occurs everywhere .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and being treated with Bi@@ validation , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after replacing the treatment with Bi@@ ov@@ ru@@ din reached the level prior to the treatment .
starting from the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ator ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of blood .
in the combination of Bi@@ of@@ ru@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters can be monitored regularly .
animal experimental studies are inadequate in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the delivery or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ en@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the group as well as in patients treated with he@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women and patients over 65 years of pre@@ valent adverse events compared to male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both mild and severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges performed significantly less often than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , ≥ 5 cm in the point of correction , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels ≥ 3 g / dl with well known blood supply , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations , observed at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; Mis@@ cellaneous &quot; points of points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with a bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the group as well as in patients treated with he@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women and patients over 65 years of pre@@ valent adverse events compared to male or younger patients .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed together according to system organic classes in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with the bi@@ vali@@ din must be immediately dis@@ rupted and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to the signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains a bi@@ vali@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ flav@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center as well as in the an@@ ion of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ id , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is slowly spl@@ itting the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , there was no th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is verified by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was subsequently performed in the patients , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery will be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ questioned He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was given according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of the random@@ isation ) or the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or upper arm or administered as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin can not process effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is very slightly different from human insulin , and the change means that it acts more quickly and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body insulin can not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adult type 1 diabetes , after six months a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was noted in comparison to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % for insulin secre@@ tion .
in adults with type 2 diabetes the decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in human insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who are hyper@@ sensitive to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the del@@ to@@ id muscle or to apply sub@@ cut@@ aneous via continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdominal bell .
due to the decreased glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced .
any change in the effectiveness of the brand ( manufacturers ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production can change the insulin requirement .
3 A inadequate dosing or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin that is used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ rus , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened or missing under the influence of symp@@ athetic oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and spare @-@ pin .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin is not absorbed into breast milk nor is it resor@@ bed after oral use .
listed below are listed according to system organ@@ ics and sorted by decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; not known ( frequency based on available data ) .
cold sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual creation or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , excessive dog bats , changes in vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Wir@@ d fails to change the injection point within the injection area continuously , as a result , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous dose of glucose by a doctor .
after a glu@@ co@@ ag@@ ine injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of serious hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( in particular by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) and the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ ic normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 males aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in therapeu@@ tically relevant dosing range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional concei@@ ving effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ey effect , just like human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast acting insulin as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucose release effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a similar post @-@ den@@ unci@@ al gly@@ cem@@ ic control is reached , as with human insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin pulses were taken in 2 minutes before the meal , a better postoperative control was achieved than with human insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin pulses are applied in 15 minutes after the meal begins , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved , as with a human insulin analog , which is given 2 mixed cu@@ es before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin pulses with gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal in comparison to human insulin analog which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the meal begins ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to human insulin analog , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ zer with gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the beginning of the meal , compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
