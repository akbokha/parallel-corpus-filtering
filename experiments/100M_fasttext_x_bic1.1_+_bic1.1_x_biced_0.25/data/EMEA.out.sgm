<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the CHMP committee has judged the studies carried out to make recommendations for the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for taking (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a psychic disorder where the patients alternate manic episodes (periods of abnormal mood) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have referred to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased anxiety or behavioural disorders when oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for taking or the enamel tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time that are broken down as well as abilify, the dose of abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is believed to be a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol acts like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser degree than the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Ariadprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, which reduces psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify, the reoccurrence of symptoms, was studied in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased restlessness, with which from Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in patients "symptoms by means of a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to examine how the body absorbs the enamel tablets and resorption (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both trials with the injection solution, patients who received abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, significantly increased the symptoms of increased unrest than those who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In four of the five short-term studies, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, for up to 74 weeks, Abilify also prevented effective treatment as placebo for re-onset of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled socks), nausea, nausea, somnolence (drowsiness), nausea, nausea, nausea, fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who spoke mostly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazole outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the committee concluded that the advantages of the injection solution in fast control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd., for placing abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar-I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Consideration for the greater sensitivity of this group of patients should be considered a lower initial dose if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, even in case of treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Ariadprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazl should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, leakage disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood-pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accelerized and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occuring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia in a patient treated with Abilify, consider reducing the dose or canceling the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Ariadprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events associated with Aripiprazole treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly regarding the deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally schizophrenic and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary action of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is required if Ariadprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally-effective medicines with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famidin, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC from Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and Paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= "poor") metabolization, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6 extensively metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common application of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="55">After putting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with Abilify, can be expected with a moderate increase in Ariadprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextrometamorphan / 3-methoxymorphine-ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextrometamorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy because of insufficient data for human safety and due to the concerns raised in animal reproduction studies, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned about using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Ariadprazol has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ariadprazole, a generally lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Ariadprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Ariadprazole, and 15.1% in patients under oplantine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">In a controlled study for 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Ariadprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients suffering from haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study for 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.6% in patients under Ariadprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS amounted to 18.2% for patients treated with Ariadprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between patient groups under Ariadprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Ariadprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and about their occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazole, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older Dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute overdoses with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Ariadprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosing since Aripiprazol has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disruption through the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2 and D3 receptor and the serotonin 5HT1 and 5HTA receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergigen and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">With the administration of Aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks in healthy subjects, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, at Nucleus caudatus and on the Putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Ariadprazole showed statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents who received a response to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Ash depression rate scale, showed significantly stronger improvement compared to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher response rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olancino-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study goal was' weight gain ', a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disruption, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disruption, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed a placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12, Aripiprazol showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on how to lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics that did not apply to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Ariadprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar retreat, mainly in the prevention of a recurrence in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyprozation of Aripiprazole, the N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole for extensive metabolites over CYP2D6 and at approximately 146 hours in "poor" (= "poor") metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">There are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects in case of a pharmacokinetic study of schizophrenic patients.</seg>
<seg id="91">A specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not reveal any clinically significant differences in regard to ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Ariadprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Ariadprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in the case of dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, thus they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was observed as a result of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dosing (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81x of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in hydroxy- Aripiprazole do not exceed 6% of the concentrations observed in the study for 39 weeks in the gall of apes, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of 3- and 11-fold of the central steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) can be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicines already used for maintenance or acutely (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If an additional oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to abilify tablets, Abilify enamel tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection in patients with agility and behavioural disorders that were otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of the bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is deemed necessary in addition to the Ariadprazol injection solution, patients should be observed with respect to extreme sedation or blood pressure loss (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not available to patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazl should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, leakage disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood-pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accelerized and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occuring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and heart rhythm disorders).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly regarding the deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenia patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of sedation was greater compared with the following dose of Aripiprazole, in a study in which healthy volunteers Aripiprazole (15 mg dosage) was applied intramuscular and the same time lauzepam (2 mg dosage) were intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famidin, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In contrast to CYP2D6 'poor' (= "poor") metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteaseininhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="160">After putting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) intramuscularly received, the intensity of sedation was greater compared with the after allsome gift of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical studies using the Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant adverse events (*) in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Ariadprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study for 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.6% in patients under Ariadprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS amounted to 18.2% for patients treated with Ariadprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between patient groups under Ariadprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Ariadprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Among the side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and about their occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazole, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older Dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders were the Aripiprazole injection solution with statistically significant improvements in aggiance / behavioural dysfunction compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agility and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of agility and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepa Reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from baseline value on PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour point was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined because of a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents who adhered to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary study targets including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate scale, showed significantly greater improvement compared to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">Placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher response rate for Aripiprazole (oral), which was 34% in the Ariadprazol- (oral) group and 57% in placebo.</seg>

<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled trial for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics that did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74-week extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Ariadprazole showed a superior position compared to placebo for the prevention of a recurrence in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazole AUC is 90% larger in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the AUC is equal to the same dose as a tablet; the systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the mean time up to reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripiprazol injection was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration in a systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15- and 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">Studies on reproductive toxicity according to IV application showed no safety-related concerns following maternal exposure, which lay 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies using Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects have only been observed in the case of dosages or expositions which have exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; thus they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent low-kidney toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase in adrenal-state carcinomas and combined adrenal-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was observed as a result of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dosing (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81-fold of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quick reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy in any dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood's heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphage, bloating, tongue-burning, dry mouth, painful gums, loose stools, oeshagitis, pain in the abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of musculature, muscular pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, stromal pain, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 789 patients.</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an enhancement-microtubules active substance that promotes the conformation of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin conveys the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells, and in in-vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendothelial transport is conveyed by the gp-60 Albatype receptor and, due to the albuminous protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine), appears to be paclitaxel in the area of the tumour.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two randomised, unblinded studies and 454 patients who were treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion for 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as 3-hour infusion with prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion with no pre-medication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastatic disease.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously not received chemotherapy, 27% only had adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive first-line therapy are below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy level 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for decay on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the entire paclitaxel compared to 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active agent exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous dose of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravascularial distribution and / or soft speed of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel compared with intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane were compared with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the Abraxane administration (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher in Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxilitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for cumulative urea excretion of less than 1% of the total dose of 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel resulted in a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years because only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">Chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and above light light protected over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic medicine and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be observed when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is injected into an Abraxane water bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete encore the solution should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid material.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the water bottle for at least 2 minutes should be swivelled slowly and carefully and / or inverted until a complete resuspension is made.</seg>
<seg id="329">If precipitation or sinuses are visible, the water bottle must be gently inverted to achieve complete resuspension prior to the application.</seg>

<seg id="357">Member states must ensure that the owner of the marketing authorisation for placing on the market will provide medical professionals in dialysis centers and retail stores with the following information and materials:</seg>
<seg id="358">• Training Brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the medicine (technical information), labelling and packaging. • Unique model depicting the correct application of the product for transport by patients.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called "reference drug").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels, in which complications arise in the context of blood transfusion, if a blood-blood-donation is not possible prior to the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self-blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his caregiver, provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, haemoglobin levels should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be monitored prior to treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by an erythropoietal deficiency or that the body does not adequately address the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, enabling it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">In the course of a major study of 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused anaemia, Abseamed was compared with the reference drug.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected by Eprex / Erypo for at least eight weeks before either switched to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period between 25 and 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of Abseamed under the skin were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients converted to Abseamed were maintained to the same extent as those who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most frequent side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, piercing migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed in accordance with the European Union regulations, evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile, such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that manufactures abseamed will provide information packages for the medical professionals in all member states, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted the company Medic medicinal products Pütter GmbH & Co KG a permit for the placing of abseamed across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of the demand for transfusion in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, which receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (for example cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in the case of planned larger operating interventions (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">To reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be used before a large elective orthopaedic procedure in adults with no iron deficiency in which a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml can be used, which cannot take part in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l) except for pediatric patients, in which the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anaemia symptoms and effects may vary depending on age, gender and total disease; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">Increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual haemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient or under the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be attempted to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest permitted dose required to control anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in increments of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anaemia symptoms and - sequelae may vary depending on age, gender and total disease; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be attempted to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest permitted dose required for checking the anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the hemoglobin value increased by at least 1 g / dl (0,62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocyte number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to baseline value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the Retikulocyte number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl has risen to the baseline, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocyte number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocyte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline value, a response to the epoetin-alfa-therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), where a precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood canned foods are required, Abseamed should receive a dose of 600 I.U. / kg bodyweight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should begin as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the onset of the autologous blood donation program - that large iron reserves are available before the start of the abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each in 10 consecutive days, on the day of engagement and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the tube of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml of isotonic salt solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from treatment with some erythropoietin at a erythroblastomenia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastoenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep vein occlusion (e.g. anamnestic venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients who are unable to participate in an autologous blood donation program: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, vascular disease of the carotid or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred cardiac infarction or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoenia (PRCA) Very rarely was reported about the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of action, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the Retikulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes of non-response (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminiumtoxiation, infections or inflammations, blood loss and haemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Retikulocyte value, in consideration of anaemia (i.e. the Retikulocytes "Index"), is degraded (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other cause of a loss of action is found, the anti-erythropoietin antibodies are determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be considered for diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous application of Abseamed in patients with a risk of anti-body induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoiesis stimulating active substances (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials did not reveal any significant benefits that can be attributed to the administration of epoetins when the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required for checking the anaemia symptoms and avoiding blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The increase in haemoglobin should be about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evidenced coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with kidney failure, which are not yet liable to dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">A 2-3-week delay between epoetin-alfa dose and erythropoietin response should be taken into account in the case of tumour patients under chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l), the dose must be adapted according to section 4.2, in order to minimize the risk of potential thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit risk assessment involving the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">Patients with a larger electrical orthopaedic procedure should, if possible, investigate the cause of anaemia before the onset of epoetin-alfa-therapy and be treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing a greater elective orthopaedic procedure should receive adequate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially with underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epoetin alfa a higher risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events can exist for patients with an initial hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose should be adapted to the increasing haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there is no indication of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF concerning hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">More than thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, aneurysm, retinalthromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients suffering from erythropoietin treatment, including patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or worsening an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients treated with erythropoetine.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoietin treatment, there may be thrombotic and vascular complications in surgical patients with cardiovascular atrophy after repeated blood donations.</seg>
<seg id="434">Epoetin alfa is glycosilicated and is identical with the amino acids and carbohydrate content with the endogenous human erythropoetin, isolated from the urine of anemic patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown with the aid of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates the erythropoesis and does not influence leukopovese.</seg>

<seg id="567">Aclasta is used to treat the following diseases: • Osteoporosis (a disease that makes the bones brittle) both in women after menopause and in men.</seg>
<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high fracture risk (fractures), including those who have recently suffered a low traumatic hip fracture as in the Hindus; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment; patients with hip fractures should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) before the first infusion or by injection into a muscle.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of acetamol or ibuprofen (remedy against inflammation) shortly after the application of acetamol can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following the infusion such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included two 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who had recently undergone a hip fracture; the number of fractures has been studied over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In two studies, Accista was tested in a total of 357 patients and compared with risedron (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of effectiveness was whether the alkaline phosphatase content in the serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) in the blood again normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Acapsta (excluding other osteoporosis) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="578">Comparing all patients under Acapsta (with or without other osteoporosis) with those under Placebo the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fractures 9% of patients under Accista had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients in placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonates or other bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, infusion and osteonecsis (loss of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of aclasta provides information material for physicians who prescribe aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains information on how to apply the medicine, as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following key messages include: • The package supplement • contraindication in pregnancy and in nursing women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When resorting to medical or nursing aid</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous intravenous 5 mg aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, aclasta's infusion is recommended two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Accista should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">Following a treatment of Paget with Accista, a long period of remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable for patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient supply of calcium, according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture an initial dose of 50,000 to 125.000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first Accista infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of acetamol may be reduced by the administration of acetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with renal dysfunction (see section 4.4) Patients with a creatinin-clearing &lt; 35 ml / min are not recommended because limited clinical experience exists for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dosage adjustment is not necessary, as bioavailability, distribution and elimination with older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Accista are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, since data for safety and efficacy is missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalcemia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment with aclasta (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of Zoledron acid on bone reconstruction, temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia develops, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the infusion of aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable for patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient amount of calcium, equivalent to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene) should be considered an appropriate preventive dental treatment before using bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who require dental interventions, no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan for each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of acetamol or ibuprofen can be reduced shortly after applying acetamol (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of suspected cases of atrial fibrillation was increased in patients receiving aclasta (1,3%) (51 from 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">Osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) were comparable to the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%).</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledron acid was associated with kidney function disorders associated with decrease of kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">Changes in the creatinin-clearing (measured per year before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as reduced kidney function were comparable in a clinical trial for osteoporosis for three years comparable to the acetate and placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinine within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), compared to 21% of patients treated with aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after hip fractures and in the Morbus Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent fracture fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to administration of aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after the administration of Zoledron acid in a large clinical study were reported about local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area has been shown, especially in cancer patients, via osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area) that were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervening.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Study with 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the jaw area with an aclasta and a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of overdose, which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation of oral calcium and / or an IV infusion of calcium gluconate can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of aclasta 5 mg once annually for 3 consecutive years was demonstrated in postmenopausal women (7,736 women aged 65 to 89 years) or at least two mild or moderate existing spinal fluid or BMD-T-score for the femoral contracture ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric Eddy-body fractures Accista were significantly over a period of three years, as well as the incidence of one or more new spinal fractures after one year (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Accista showed a consistent effect over three years which resulted in reduced risk of hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density at the lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increasing the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the knee-neck by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) a year after the third annual dose bone biopsies were taken from the pelvic ridge.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomographic (µCT) analysis showed an increase in trabecular bone volume and the preservation of trabecular bone architecture compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone tumor markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BPD), the N-terminal propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in the serum and the beta-C-Teleptide (b-CTx) in the serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Accista significantly reduced BSAP significantly by 30% compared to baseline and was kept at 28% below the initial value for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D (50.000 to 125.000 I.E. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortgage was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Accista, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Accista treatment increased the BMD compared to placebo for all time points.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Accista treatment conducted more than 24 months compared to placebo for an increase in BMD by 5.4% in total and 4.3% at the femoral neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% for Accista-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once-yearly administration of aclasta was not inferior to the weekly administration of alendronate relative to the percentage change in BMD after 24 months compared to the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of treatment with Morbus Paget of the bone Accista was studied in patients aged more than 30 years with radiologically proven, mainly moderate to moderate-severe morphology Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase corresponding to the age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of risedron once a day for 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for aclasta and risedron.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month main study (responded to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with aclasta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic approach in 141 of patients treated with Risacronat could be maintained at an average duration of the follow-up phase of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes perfusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledron acid in 64 patients resulted in the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Then the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearing from the large cycle with half-life time t ½ of α 0,24 and t ½ to 1.87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above ½ -values) probably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the prescribed dose occurs in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance is 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a reduction of the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the area below the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A decreased clearance of substances metabolized by cytochrom-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely, because Zoledronylic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, substance-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the Zoledron acid correlated with the creatinin-clearing, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin-clearing, and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">From this it follows that an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney dysfunction to a creatinin-clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the Zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because for severe kidney dysfunction (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data is available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letally active intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies in dogs single doses of 1,0 mg / kg (based on the AUC the 6x of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In trials with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of Zoledron acid in rats was administered in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose equivalent to the 6x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated exposure to cumulated expositions that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects occurred in other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as the intravenous injection site.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spongiosa in the metaphor of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding which reflects the pharmacological, absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats were treated with teratogenicity of 0,2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the reduced serum calcium level.</seg>
<seg id="663">If the medicine is not used immediately, the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application; normally, 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a representative of a class of substances called bisphosphonates, and is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, the osteoporosis in men and the Morbus Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially oestrogens, which are made of androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">Bone reconstruction is quickly done with the Morbus Paget, and new bone material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta acts by normalizing the bone structure, thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus reinforces the bone strength.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in a dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, inform your doctor that you are treated with aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you are using aclasta with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or the nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently used / used it, even if it is non-prescription medicine.</seg>

<seg id="739">In some, however, not in all cases the start of convulsions seems to be associated with procedural stress such as dealing with animals.</seg>
<seg id="740">If Rimonabant was given over a longer period before the combination (9 weeks), which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rimonabant, no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or menstrual disturbances.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations for the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which cannot be adjusted satisfactorily with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonic resin or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonic acid or insulin can be maintained with the start of the acetate treatment, except for hypoglycemia patients (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of the sulfonylurea and / or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients, Actos efficacy was examined in tripletherapy; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonyl resin. in addition, they received either acetate or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a decrease in the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar values were lowered in the application of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triple treatment study, the effect of the additional administration of acetin and a sulphonyl resin showed a decrease in HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, the patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin had a decrease in HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who received additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with acetate were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoesthesia (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients with metformin as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approval for Actos in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the mark "15" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for pioglitazone patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor (i.e., previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase dosage.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserves.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema if pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in heart failure reports, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated output liver enzyme levels (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme levels are to be controlled again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate hepatic dysfunction, such as nausea, vomiting, upper stomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision as to whether the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone should be continued until the laboratory parameters have been evaluated by clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated that can agitate fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a slight reduction of the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the treatment with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparison-controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients with metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3.6-4.1%) and to a lesser extent in patients under sulphonyl resins and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and haematocrit by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, there is a risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia in patients who receive pioglitazone as oral bipolar or triple-combination therapy with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, the treatment with thiazolidindions, including pioglitazone, was reported to decrease the visual acuity in diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct relationship between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be taken into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and in case a patient wishes for a pregnancy or this occurs, treatment may be discarded (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies to investigate interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetic or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC from pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in AUC from pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone reduces the hypercholesterolemia resulting in pregnancy and increases the insulin resistance of the cervix, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequent &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not invaluable from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgate and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazone ALT ascents beyond threefold of the upper limit of the normal range were equally common as placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylurea.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with preexisting advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency in Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo if pioglitazone or pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported about heart failure in Pioglitazone more frequently, however, if Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary of reports of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients were performed in the groups treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive trial running over a period of 3.5 years, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">In case of taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ) (PPAR-γ), which results in increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazone reduces the glucoseproduction in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose tolerance in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus gliclacide as monotherapy was continued for two years in order to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the start of the therapy a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone at 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled trial for 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three months of improvement with insulin were randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients treated with Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c reduced by 0.45% compared to those who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over one year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients was statistically significant compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was studied in a small study of type 2 diabetes in a small, 18-week study.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction in overall plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and a rise in HDL- cholesterol levels and low, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced overall plasmatglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or liclacide, and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, there was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels below Pioglitazone, while lower levels of metformin and liclacide were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone did not only reduce the triglycerides, but also improved the post-radial increased triglyceride level, both through an effect on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease in groups were randomised to receive either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to efficacy is equivalent to the triple of the efficacy of pioglitazone whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">Interaction studies have shown that Pioglitazone does not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the subjects (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination-time of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans and the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral Clearance of the parent substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies were observed in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible excessive heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the decrease in the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth under treatment with Pioglitazon, which reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumors (male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiacolidindions led to an increased frequency of colorectal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side mark "30" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study for two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with either pioglitazone or liclacide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinin quotients was statistically significant compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the triglycerides, but also improved the post-radial increased triglyceride level, both through an effect on Tryglyceride absorption and hepatic Tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the target of its primary endpoint, which presented a combination of the overall mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary reascularization and revascularization of the leg arteries, results suggest that with the intake of pioglitazone no cardiovascular risk of long-term risks are associated.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side mark "45" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone and of more than 7,400 patients receiving comparative medication, increased incidence of fractures in women was observed.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actrophane was studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, in which the body is unable to use the insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Acetphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were similarly reduced with another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">You may also need to adjust the doses of acetphane if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be removed from the package contents).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of acetphane in the treatment of diabetes outweigh the risks.</seg>

<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are usually used once or twice a day if a quick initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">For example, patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by intensified insulin therapy may be able to perceive the hypoglycemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in strength, brand (producers), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analogue) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA to insulin-animal origin) can cause a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dosage adjustment is required when changing to acetphane in the patient, this can be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>

<seg id="1186">As with other resin-based medicines, acute gout may occur during the treatment, because the reduction in the serum harnleic acid levels may first mobilize uric acid deposits in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. malignant diseases and their treatment (Lesch- Nyhan-Syndrome) increase the absolute concentration of Xanthin in the urine in rare cases so far that it has to be deposited in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver disease During phase 3 clinical trials, slight abnormalities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the febuxostat treatment begins and in the subsequent course (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwas did not conduct any interaction studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO-inhibiting can lead to an increase in theophylone level (an inhibition of the metabolisation of theophylline was also reported for other XO-inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, the simultaneous display of febuxostat and naproxen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in the Febuxostat exposition (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not related to a clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorothiazide / Varfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without the need for a dose adjustment for febuxostat or the other active ingredient used at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study with subjects 120 mg of ADENURIC 1 x daily showed an average 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antacids It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an antacid, the magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delayed the absorption of febuxostat (around 1 hour) and caused a decrease in CMAx by 32%, but no significant change in AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancies may not include side effects of febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of fetus / newborns.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be cautious when controlling a vehicle, serving machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the overall febuxosty group in the pivotal study phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with Febuxostat could be found.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors in these patients were arteriosklerotic disease and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects, which could be observed in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Febuxostat and reported more than once in all Febuxostat treatment groups, are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients treated with colchicin at the same time. * * In the clinical trials no severe rashes or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 open long-term extension studies In the open long-term extension studies 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1204">Treatment related events reported during long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported in all Febuxostat- treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years).</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in the pivotal studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypaesthesia, conspicuous ECG, coughing, short breathe, skin discolorations, skin lesions, bursitis, proteinuria, renal insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, increase in blood, decrease in lymphocyte, decrease in number of white blood cells.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Mechanism of action uric acid is the end product of the purine metabolism in humans and arises as part of the reaction chaskade hypoxanthin → Xanthin → Juric acid.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Febuxostat is a potent, non-Purin-selective inhibitor of the XO (NP-SIxO) with a Ki value for in vitro inhibition left below the nanomolar range.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The efficacy of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were conducted with 1,832 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint in each study was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly dose levels were &lt; 6,0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily (n = 258), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 258) for patients with a serum creatine intrinsic value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed statistically significant superiority in both treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventionally used doses allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed statistically significant superiority in both treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conventionally used dose of allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Patients with serum creatininininals &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl) or 300 mg 1 x daily (n = 509) were summarized for analysis.</seg>
<seg id="1216">The lowering of the acid water level to &lt; 6,0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">In 509 patients, allopurinol received 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum increments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">The primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with kidney function restriction The APEX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction (ie.).</seg>
<seg id="1219">The primary efficacy endpoint of ADENURIC was 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage decline of serum concentrations in subjects regardless of kidney function (58% in the group with normal renal function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum-acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl of Etwa 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum hardness levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in incidence of gout seizures, so that less than 3% of the patients needed a treatment against a gout (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not require any treatment against a giraine).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the plaited nodes, which resulted in 54% of the patients a complete disappearance of the gth node by month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients who received a long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients receiving allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of febuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is greater than the dose proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking ordinary or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the CMAx amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5,0-5.3 μg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum resin concentration, provided this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume (Vss / F) of Febuxostat is from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma protein binding of Febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primary bond to albumin) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsoms showed that these oxidative metabolites are predominantly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronid mainly arises through UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuxostat, about 49% of the dose in the urine was found as immutable Febuxostat (3%), the known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) as well as other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion via urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair found an unchanged Febuxostat (12%), Acylglukuronid of the active substance (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and its conjugate (25%) as well as other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the CMAx of Febuxostat did not change compared to subjects with normal renal function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC of Febuxostat declined approximately the 1.8-fold of 7.5 μ g ⋅ yr / ml in the group with normal renal function to 13.2 μ g ⋅ yr / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 Liver dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child-Pugh classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh-Classification B) Liver dysfunction, the CMAx and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Age There were no significant changes in regard to the AUC of Febuxostat or its metabolites after taking multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in older patients compared to younger subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats, a statistically significant increase in urinary bladder tumours (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dose treated group, with approximately 11-fold exposure in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific purine metabolization and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It has been noted that febuxostat has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, which were about 4-times the human therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred which accompanied by a reduction in the rearing performance and a developmental delay in the offspring of rats.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratological studies in carrying rats with expositions, approximately the 4.3-fold and in carrying rabbits with expositions, which amounted to about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure, did not result in teratogenic effects.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorothiazide / Varfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without the need for a dose adjustment for febuxostat or the other active ingredient used at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1254">In some people, uric acid accumulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that uric acid becomes insoluble.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you keep urine acid concentration low by taking the 1 x daily intake of ADENURIC, the formation of the crystals is prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="1256">ADENURIC must not be taken, if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredient Febuxostat or any of the other components of ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine, if you have a heart weakness or have or may suffer from any other heart problem. • If you are treated as a result of a high level of uric acid concentration in the wake of a cancer illness or the Lesch-Nyhan-Syndrome (a rare congenital disorder where there is too much uric acid in your blood).</seg>
<seg id="1258">If you have an attack at the moment (sudden appearance of severe pain, pressure sensitivity, redness, warmth and joint swelling), wait until the drop is cleared before you start treatment with ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1259">This does not have to be with everyone, but could also occur with you, especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months when you are taking ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1260">Your doctor will prescribe other medicines if necessary, in order to prevent an attack or to treat the associated symptoms (such as pain and joint swelling).</seg>
<seg id="1261">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently used / used it, even if it is non-prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1262">It is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use / apply any of the following substances, since interactions with ADENURIC can occur and your doctor may want to consider necessary measures. • Mercaptopurine (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (for blood thinning with heart disease)</seg>
<seg id="1263">No studies have been carried out on the effects of ADENURIC on traffic jams and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Please use ADENURIC only after consultation with your doctor if you know that you suffer from intolerance to certain sugars.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient must not lie until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">As alendronate and vitamin D3 are already separately used in medicines which are approved in the European Union, the company submitted data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to prove the efficacy of ADROVANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those with Alendronate alone (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data that suggests that the alendronate dose included in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headache, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), constipation, diarrhea (ulceration), swollen abdomen (blower abdomen) as well as acid repulsion.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with any hypersensitivity to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any other component, ADROVANCE may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It must not be used in case of diseases of the esophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot sit or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1287">ADROVANCE is only available with water (not with mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first meal, drink or intake of medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of geophageal irritation and associated side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after daytime. • Patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera. • Patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleedings or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract, except pyloroplasty, can be given only with special care (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal responses such as oesophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by ophageal lines, were reported in patients taking alendronate (some were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible ophageal reactions, and patients should be pointed out in the occurrence of symptoms of ophageal irritation like dysphagia, pain during swallowing or retroviral pain or new or deteriorating heartburn to remedy the drug and seek medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious ophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or continue taking it after symptoms that indicate bad-hageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical studies with alendronate no increased risk was detected, stomach and duodenal ulcers, including some serious and associated with complications, were rarely reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoarthritis of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimen mainly administered intravenous bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There is no data available to indicate whether a bisphosphonate therapy in patients who require a maxillary surgery reduces the risk of osteoarthritis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed that if you miss a dose of ADROVANCE, you should take the tablet next morning after you have noticed your failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but will continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be adequately treated before starting treatment with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and drinks (including mineral water), supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the resorption of alendronate if taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking alendronate, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, Alendronate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for the application of postmenopausal women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy nor by breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteoarthritis of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bisphosphonates; most of the reports date from cancer patients, but osteoporosis patients were also reported.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Nevertheless, decreases in serum calcium to &lt; 8.0 mg / l (2.0 mmol / l) and serum phosphate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency.</seg>
<seg id="1309">Alendronate following an oral overdose can be hypocalcemia, hypophosphatmia and side effects in the upper gastrointestinal tract such as stomach upset, heartburn, oeshagitis, gastritis or ulcera.</seg>

<seg id="1311">The main effect of 1.25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 is the increase of intestinal resorption of calcium and phosphate, as well as the regulation of serum calcium, renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone resorption.</seg>
<seg id="1312">In severe cases, a deficiency of secondary hyperparathyreoidism, hypophosphatmia, weakness of the proximal musculature and osteomalazia can lead to increased risk of falls and fractures in osteoporotic patients.</seg>

<seg id="1315">After 15 weeks of treatment, the mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher (26%) in the group under ADROVANCE (70 mg / 2,800 I.U.) (56 nmol / l [23 ng / ml]) than in the group under Alendronat alone (46 nmol / l [18.2 ng / ml]).</seg>
<seg id="1316">ADROVANCE (70 mg / 2,800 I.U.) significantly decreased the proportion of patients with vitamin D insufficiency after 15 weeks (serum value of 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt; 37,5 nmol / l [&lt; 15 ng / ml]) by 62.5% compared to alendronate alone (12% vs.</seg>
<seg id="1317">Studies with alendronate The therapeutic equivalent of alendronate once weekly 70 mg (n = 519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n = 370) was demonstrated in a one-year multicenter study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="1318">The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in postmenopausal women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design (n = 944) and fracture intervention study (FIT: n = 6.459).</seg>
<seg id="1319">In the phase III studies, the moderate ascents of the BMD with alendronate 10 mg / day compared to placebo in 3 years 8.8% on the spine, 5.9% on the femur neck and 7.8% at the trochanter.</seg>

<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical study were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplant, comparing Advagraf with Prograf / Prograf or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transplant was repelled after one year (by examining, for example, how often a re-transplant or resumption of dialysis was required).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, more recent studies in 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant were performed and examined how Advagraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only physicians who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dose; renditions of the formulation or the regime should only be undertaken under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that systemic exposure of tacrolimus is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-level rules (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus-Talks should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On day 4, the systemic exposure measured as a level mirror was comparable with both formulations in both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated inspections of the Tacrolimus-Talks are recommended during the first two weeks following transplant under Advagraf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post-transplant phase.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application For suppression of graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advance therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustments may be required later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of the patient following the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplantation Prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - switching from Prograf to Advagraf must be a transplant receiver of twice daily dose of Prograf Capsules to a once daily intake of Advantool, so this changeover is to be done at a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After switching from other immunosuppressants to AdvantyOnce a day, the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation for prophylaxis of graft rejection must begin daily.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant For adult patients who are converted to Advagraf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung, pancreatic and intestinal transplanted patients, performed in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in pankreastly transplanted patients at an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage Adaptations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood-tallies in the targeted area can be required for patients with severe liver dysfunction to reduce the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, careful monitoring of renal function (including a regular determination of serum increas levels, a calculation of the ininininants and a monitoring of the urination volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to Advagraf With the conversion from a Ciclosporto to a Tacrolimus-based therapy caution is advisable (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the blood level in full blood The dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases by using whole-blood tacrolimus-tallow controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks following transplant, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to Advent, Dosage adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or while using substances that could alter the tacrolimus dorsal blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advagraf is a medicinal product with a low clearance, adjustments to the dose may require several days before the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The indications in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the level of sebum in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the blood levels of Tacrolimus in thoroughbred in the first time after liver transplantations are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and cardiac transplants, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which can occur in consequence of tacrolimus sub-exposure or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dose; renditions of the formulation or the regime should only be undertaken under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be refractory compared to other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">No clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf is available for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adults with adult heart transplants and graft recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) can be avoided (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">A particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood is offered in patients with diarrhoea because the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf, a hypertrophy referred to as cardiomyopathy was observed under Prograf, which can therefore occur under Advagraf as well.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malignant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who are taking Tacrolimus symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and vision disturbances, should be a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood level while simultaneously offering substances that can alter the CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dosage to maintain consistent concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels was primarily due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; hence, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase the hormone exposure, decisions about contraceptive measures are particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus may potentially reduce the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and extend their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients have no indication that under tacrolimus compared to other immunosuppressants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for any adverse effects of tacrolimus (especially regarding its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1466">Cases of BK-virus-associated nephropathy and JC-virus-associated progressive multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients suffering from immunosuppression therapy, including therapy with Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in conjunction with treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, tacrolimus can not be dialyzed.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects At the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus are mediated by its binding to a cytosolic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents transcription of a certain number of lymphocykin genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphocells (like interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1480">Published results of primary immunosuppression with tacrolimus in the form of twice daily used Prograf Capsules after other primary organ transplants Prograf has become a recognised primary immunosuppressant following pancreatic, lung and intestinal transplantations.</seg>
<seg id="1481">175 patients, with 475 patients who had undergone a pancreatic transplantation and in 630 patients treated as primary immunosuppressive in 630 patients.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral program in these published studies was consistent with the large studies in which Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression with liver, kidney and cardiac transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis over a recent, multi-center study with oral program, more than 110 patients were reported that received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin in 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliter- syndrome, was seen less frequently in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus it occurred in 21.7% of cases to develop bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be converted to tacrolimus (n = 0.02) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were converted from tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute rejection was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus Group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the incidence of chronic bronchiolitis was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multi-center study with oral program was performed in 205 patients undergoing pancreatic and kidney transplantation, receiving a randomised trial of Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to reach the target levels of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the unbound faction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism induced by corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearances observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion mainly occurs via the gall.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraf was approximately 10% lower than Prograf for stable patients who were converted from Prograf (twice daily) to the total daily allowance.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks following transplant, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be refractory compared to other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advent is used to treat and prevent haemorrhages in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital heart defect caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Advent is used to treat hemorrhages or to prevent haemorrhages in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that empowers it to the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain any human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of hemorrhages as well as surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the effectiveness of Advent in the prevention of hemorrhages in 86% of 510 new blood episodes was "excellent" or "well" evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) include dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">It may not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to the human scent factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in March 2004, the European Commission granted the company Baxter AG a permit for placing Advate in the European Union." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following haemorrhagic events the factor VIII activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or more repeat until the pain and the acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat all 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, adequate determination of the factor VIII plasma levels is recommended to control the dose and frequency of the injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII, reach different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-value.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis On long-term prophylaxis of haemorrhages in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma is not reached or if bleeding is not controlled at a reasonable dose, a test must be performed to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitor values, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration speed should be directed after finding the patient, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against Factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the prokoagulatory activity of factor VIII-directed IgG immunoglobulins that are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestic known inhibitor development, following conversion from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the reoccurrence of (low-inverted) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences concerning the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs experienced in the largest number of patients were inhibitors to factor VIII (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of the formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), rarely known (frequency based on available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the total of the individual patients (234). the unexpected decrease of the blood clotting factor VIII-level was observed postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the day and both the factor VIII- levels in the plasma and the clearing rate again showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 children and adults 2 with a diagnosis of severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient with ADVATE showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 exposure days.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 pediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) after previous exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) found a FVIII inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) treated patients with ADVATE treated inhibitors to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating the antibody titer against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and an ongoing peak of the antibody level for anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the incidence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive, but has taken into consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, based on the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a filing of PSURs every 6 months, the CHMP has decided to apply for another extension procedure within 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited granted the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to allow the company to withdraw its application for the advent of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni-Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the chest, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures within the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been altered so that it does not produce any copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors, enabling the cancer cells to recreate the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defective p53 gene in the human body usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and kill the cells if DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53-gene is defective, the p53-protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient, in which Li-Fraumeni cancer occurred in the area of the underbelly, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had reviewed the company's answers to the questions asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initial documents submitted, the CHMP grants 120 a list of questions sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">The CHMP opinion was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore provides benefits for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be established in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The Company did not know the CHMP about whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "Comprehensive" programs with Advexin.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages caused by allergies) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and children over 12 years, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice a day a tablet, which is to be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clarified.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can cause constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When viewing all hay fever symptoms except for constipation of the nose, the patients who received Aerinaze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was examined, the patients under Aerinaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who were not alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) include tachycardia, dryness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (somnia), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to deschloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other components, anti-adrenergic agents or laureadin (another medicine used to treat allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients suffering from congenital glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertonia, hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroidism), hyperthyroidism (cerebral overfunction), or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of Aerinaze to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swallowed whole (i.e. without biting it, crushing or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of absence due to lack of data on the safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days, as long-term use can reduce the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors respectively within 2 weeks of termination of such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, Lisurid, cabergoline, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphragm etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient population and the data is not sufficient to verbalize appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze has not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertonia or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or strengthening of headache) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with heart rhythm disorders • Patients with a heart rhythm disorders • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck construction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistamines otherwise avoid positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical tests with deschloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazol were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions were observed or alterations of the plasma concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test did not reveal any significant differences between patients treated with placebo and placebo treated patients regardless of whether they were taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadiene has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In-vivo CYP3A4 not inhibited and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate is nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a drowsiness, which can lead to impairment of the traffic jam or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, reduced mental alertness, cyansis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lettuval processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, difficult mists, muscle weakness, and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, pre-cordiale pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth drought, pupil stiffness and - dilatation, skin erythema, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basedophils as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesive molecule P-Selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">During a single dose study with adults, Desiatadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestation of CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years of seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonist effectiveness of aerinaze tablets, determined by the overall score for the symptoms (except the nasal mucous swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine for the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with deschloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, deschloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after the plasma is administered.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Following the peroral application of aerinaze for healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow balance of desoratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multiple dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four test subjects were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the exclusive gift of pseudoephedrine is bioequivalent to exposure to an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, gene otoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with desciatadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of laucomamn / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 of the application application, the pharmaceutical covigilance system described and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the alleviation of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets can relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itching nose and drowning or itching eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnosing the following symptoms or diseases under the use of aerinaze: • Blood pressure • heart chasing, heart beat • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headache, or strengthening existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you take aerinaze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">The recommended dosage is not to be expected that aerinaze leads to dizziness or decreases attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a greater amount of aerinaze than you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken a greater amount of aerinaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you have forgotten the intake of Aerinaze if you forgot to take a dose in time, take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin it was very rare to report cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of heart palpitations, heart chasing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disturbances, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, in cases of inflammation of the liver and cases of abnormal liver strains has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate for taking (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five, the dose is 1,25 mg once a day, in the form of 2.5 ml syrup and / or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children between the ages of six and eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by finding the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrants, impairment of sleep and performance in days) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to intake and the enamel tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom score by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% among the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urticaria, the decrease in symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to deschloratadin, laureadin or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe to transfer Aerius to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with or without a meal, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience in clinical trials for efficacy in the use of desoratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease process and can be terminated after the symptoms end and resumed after reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="1732">During the persisting allergic rhinitis (onset of symptoms in 4 days or more days a week and over 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended during the allergy time a continuous treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with deschloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazol were given additionally (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to dizziness, which can lead to impairment of the traffic jam or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in different indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius daily than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most frequent side effects reported more frequently than placebo reported tiredness (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical trial of 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most frequent side effect was headache, this occurred at 5.9% of the patients treated with deschloratadin and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multidose trial administered up to 45 mg of deschloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basedophils as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesive molecule P-Selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which deschloratadin was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine-fold of the clinical dose) over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desiatadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal fluid and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was substituted for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, notwithstanding the etiology of the different forms, is similar and chronic patients can be recruited more easily.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As histamine removal is a causative factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that in addition to Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, other forms of urticaria will lead to an improvement in the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of pruritus and the reduction of size and number of quadrants at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the stimulus rate by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with placebo compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and alertness significantly, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of desciatadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant cumulation after a daily use of desoratadin (5- 20 mg) for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadiene has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desciatadin does not inhibit CYP2D6 in-vivo and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate is nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desciatadine at a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of deschloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with deschloratadin and laureadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of deschloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with deschloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains lactose monohydrate, hypromellose, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colourless film (contains Hypromellose, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, bleached wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there is no data available to support an infectious Rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin investigations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 are metabolized for desloratadin and experience higher levels of substance (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which are fully metabolized, is identical to that of children, which are normally metabolized.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. announced the approval of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the Company resumes its application for the prevention of aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the stem (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from person to person, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">When the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus present in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to form rapid antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this stem.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface detected by the human body as foreign body) was purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection from some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base was insufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus of type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who are not able to swallow the capsules, asgenerase is available as a solution, but it cannot be taken together with ritonavir, as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Asgenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined which antiviral medicines the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus will respond to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and other anti-viral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between the ages of 4 and 12, and for patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is based on the body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and therefore also the development of infection and disease related to AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase, which was fortified with low dose, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the alterations in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had not taken protease inhibitors after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml compared to placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few responded to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the medicine Agenerase enhanced the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effectively as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase combined with Ritonavir to decrease the viral load after four weeks than with the patients who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) include headaches, diarrhoea, flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients, the St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines that are broken down as well as asgenerase and are injected in high concentrations in the blood to health detrimental.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines against HIV, patients who are taking Agenerase have the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndromes (symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of asgenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Asgenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of asgenerase in combination with ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "" "" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "" "", "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited a permit for placing asgenerase in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1, protease inhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children aged 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase capsules are to be administered to the pharmacokinetic booster of amprenavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre-treatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from amprenavir as capsule; hence, ageneral capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram base are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the increased addition of ritonavir (boosters), higher doses of asgenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be used.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg amprenavir / kg bodyweight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenerase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use should be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given at the same time with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrom P450-ion enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to reduced plasma concentrations and reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir during the use of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that asgenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with asgenerase, does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with antiretroviral therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of concurrent antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing reduced liver function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show increased frequency of liver function disorders under antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored in line with clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous use of amperase and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of vastatin with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhubdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring of the International Regular Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medication at the same time, asgenerase can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however, the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on ovary withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are also administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this form of dosage is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with care in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy medicines were needed to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. increased age, and with drug-dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophile patients (Type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, there are reports of an increase in hemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haematarthrosis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or resident opportunistic infections can be developed at the time of initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) which leads to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multi-factorial aetiology is accepted (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher Body Mass Index), cases of osteoarthritis were reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term treatment of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 Substrate with a low therapeutic width Agenerase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width plus substrates of the Cytochrom P450-ion enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with ritonavir must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are primarily metabolized with CYP2D6 and associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase in other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were frequently observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be humiliated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amprenavirus levels and, if possible, check the viral load and depose the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when Nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, however, for CMAx reduced by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg amprenavir were used twice a day and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% abase when amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin-values of amprenavir in plasma, achieved in combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice a day), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and caletra can not be given, but it is recommended close-meshed monitoring because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study for the use of asgenerase in combination with Didanoin was carried out, but due to the attached component of Didanoin it is recommended that the revenues of didanoin and asgenerase lie at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin possibly lowers the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Should these drugs be used at the same time, caution is advised as Delavirus may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed because precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and pinion to Delavirus is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous injection of amprenavir and rifabutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 19.3%, resulting in an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer a rifabutin together with asgenerase, a reduction in the dose of rifabutin will be recommended at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once a day led to an increase in the CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma around 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the 2.69fold compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can possibly interact with interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs when used in combination with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on data from other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as asgenerase as it can cause resorption dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), amprenavir can lead to degradation of amprenavir plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, Niccolpine, nifedipine, nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased 10 by amprenavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake of asgenerase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the side-effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial where Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) more than 7 days in subjects, the fluticason propionate plasma levels rose by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous addition of amperase with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticoids, unless the possible benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are expected to have pronounced increases in plasma levels while administering asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including Rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased while amprenavir is present (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase cannot be used together with orally taken Midazolam (see section 4.3), while caution is required while using asgenerase with parenteral Midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseininhibitors indicate possible increase in Midazolam plasma levels by 3 to 4 faxes.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opatosis, especially if low doses of ritonavir are also administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation is currently available, such as amprenavir can be adjusted with methadone at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended while apitalase is present (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amprenavir related substances have been detected in the milk lactose-related rats, but it is not known whether amprenavir is transferred to people in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the implantation in the uterus until the end of the lactation period amprenavir, showed a diminished increase of 12 body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not impaired by the administration of amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of asgenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, early on and rarely leading to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether or not they are related to the use of asgenerase or another drug used for HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below come from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients who have not treated protease inhibitors received 1200 mg Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication, were performed in more than 1% of the patients, and laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are performed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and bilateral subcutaneous fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsal pelvic fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">In 113 patients treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine after 36 weeks, only one case was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, in 2 45 NRTI- pretreated patients with amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 patients (11%) in 241 patients in Indavir, in combination with different NRTIs over an average duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or macroporous nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment had to be canceled with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteoarthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term treatment of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or resident opportunistic infections at the time of introduction of antiretroviral therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In the case of PI-treated patients who received 600 mg of asgenerase twice daily with low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable; an exception were the rise in triglyceride and CPK values, which were very common in patients who received Agenerase along with low dose of pinion.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is expected to observe signs of intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures can be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thus prevents the process of viral gene and gag-pol- polyproteinespressions with the result of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0,012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amprenavir versus HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosage, the mutations described in other Ritonavir were rarely observed with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral-untreated patients who received 700mg fosamprenavir with 100mg of Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolation of 13 of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients enrolled with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I / L, I47V, D60E, I62V, I85V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its prolongation APV30005 (700 mg fosamprenavir / 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients with protease inhibitors occurred in patients with virological failure more than 96 weeks, following the following protease inhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypical resistance testing genotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F /</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutations may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysing the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance tests, clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic patterns associated with a reduced sensitivity to amprenavir creates a certain cross-resistance against ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral-untreated patients, in which a Fosamprenavir (one of 25 insulates), indinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 insulates), indinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 insulates), saquinavir (three out of 24 insulates), and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 insulates) appear.</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitors; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early abortion of an administering therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The testament to the effectiveness of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which adult treated adults after virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and a standard of care (SOC) with PI, predominantly with low-dose Ritonavir, "received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">A hundred threescore and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to asgenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-superiority of APV / ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-inferior threshold of 0,4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbleached Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution for taking and capsules of 15 mg / kg was three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dosed pinion was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks about 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data, therapeutic optimisation should be taken into consideration when treating PI pre-treated children of the expected benefit of "unbleached" asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases, for CMAx lowered by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimal concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as a unimpeded penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active component fluctuates during the dosing interval, depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the steady state over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 must be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The administration of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable than the capsules; hence asgenerase solution and ageneral capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram-basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the impact of renal dysfunction on the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir should be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those who are achieved twice daily at healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity in mice and rats, benign hepatocellular adenomas in male animals showed benign hepatocellular adenomas in dosages, corresponding to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the development of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, the present exposure data to humans, both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application, revealed little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo and In-vitro-Genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse-mutations test, mouse lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral lymphoma were contained, amprenavir was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily routine by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">No significant liver toxicity has yet been observed in clinical studies, neither during administration nor after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the mice and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposition which was significantly below (rabbits) or significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus and minor skeletal changes were observed that indicate delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the increased addition of ritonavir (boosters), higher doses of asgenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg amprenavir / kg bodyweight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous use should be performed in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction with care, in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring of the International Regular Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Agenerase should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of a lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors, such as higher age, and with drug-dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increases, however, for CMAx reduced by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin-values of amprenavir in plasma, achieved in combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice a day), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and caletra can not be given, but it is recommended close-meshed monitoring because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed because precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and pinion to Delavirus is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer a rifabutin together with asgenerase, a reduction in the dose of rifabutin will be at least half of the recommended dose 31, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, nifedipine, Niccolpine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nanodipine and verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical trial where Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) more than 7 days in subjects, the fluticason propionate plasma levels rose by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of norethintoxicology) led to an increase in AUC and Cmin by 22% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2080">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the implantation in the uterus until the end of the lactation period amprenavir, showed a diminished increase in body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The harmlessness of asgenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of overdose, the patient is expected to observe signs of intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures can be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0,012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Conversely, amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitors; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, therapeutic optimisation should be taken into consideration when treating PI pre-treated children of the expected benefit of "unbleached" agroase.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active component fluctuates during the dosing interval, depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the steady state over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 must be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2174">The application frequency and duration of treatment with Aldara depends on the disease to be treated: • Aldara is to be performed three times a week in case of cowards in the genital area. • In case of small cell carcinomas, it is performed three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment, with a break between the treatment courses three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Before bedtime, apply the cream to the affected areas of the skin, so that it remains on the skin for a long time (about eight hours) before being washed off.</seg>
<seg id="2176">In all studies, Aldara was compared with a placebo (the same cream but without the active agent). • Aldara was tested in four main studies on 923 patients with genital warts in the genital area for 16 weeks each.</seg>
<seg id="2177">The main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated warts. • Aldara was also examined in 724 patients with small basal cell carcinomas in two studies where the patients were treated for six weeks and aldara or placebo either daily or five times a week.</seg>
<seg id="2178">The main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tumors after twelve weeks. • Aldara was also tested in two studies involving a total of 505 patients with actinic keratoses.</seg>
<seg id="2179">In all studies, Aldara was more effective than placebo. in the treatment of patients in the genital area, the total healing rate in all four main studies was 15% to 52% in the patients treated with placebo. • Results of the two studies on basal cell carcinomas showed a complete healing rate of 66% to 80% in the patients treated with aldara compared to 0% to 3% in the placebo group.</seg>

<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions normaly decrease in intensity in the course of the therapy or go back after the therapy with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If local skin reactions cause major discomfort or are very strong, the treatment may be exposed for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">From the data of an open clinical trial, patients with more than 8 ac- lesions showed a lower complete cure rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>

<seg id="2210">Although no quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) have been achieved either once or after repeated topical application, no recommendation can be given to the application during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most common adverse events reported and possibly or possibly associated with the application of Imiquimod-cream in the studies with three-week treatment were local reactions in the treatment of inclination warts (33.7% of patients treated with iiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most commonly reported and possibly or possibly associated with the application of Imiquimod-cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The placebo-controlled placebo-controlled placebo-controlled placebo-controlled placebo-controlled placebo-controlled basalioma patients were shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common adverse event, probably or possibly associated with the application of iiquimod cream in relation to side effects, were in these studies a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with iiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects indicated in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with Imiquimod cream are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">These placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimod-Cream frequently resulted in local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), exposure / scraping / scraping (23%) and edema (14%).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of clinical signs presented according to the test plan shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with iiquimod-cream frequently resulted in severe erythema (31%), severe erosion (13%), and severe deformation and impregnation (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials for the treatment of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratoses, alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent oral recording of 200 mg iiquimod, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Clinical severe side effects, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, existed in hypotony, normalized after oral or IV fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, systemic concentrations of alpha interference and other cytokines have been detected after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies, it was possible to demonstrate that efficacy in response to a complete healing of the inclination in an iiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the 119 patients who had treated Imiquimod treated patients treated completely; this was the case at 20% of the 105 patients who had been treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">Total healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with Imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 male patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">Imiquimod's efficacy in five times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed individual primary super-ectable basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod with three weeks of application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non hypertrophic, non hypertrophic action lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area on the uncomfortably scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">In paediatric patients, the approved indications utterances of pronunciation, actinic keratosis and superficiency basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara creme was studied in four randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses examined there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Minimal systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three-three weekly treatment for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml when applied in the face (12.5 mg, 1 single bag), on the scalp (25mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated obvious half-life time was about 10 times higher than the two-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this points to an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod to topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients aged 6-12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with acute keratosis or supernormal basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in rat doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of CG led to significantly lowered body weight and increased spleen weight; a study on the dermal application for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year-old study on carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not induce tumors in the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for the human being is regarded as very low due to the systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the effective free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with inferior UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2256">Do not breastfeed your infant during treatment with Aldara Cream, as it is not known if Imiquimod passes into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different for inclined warts, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratoses (see specific instructions for each area of application).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream on the clean, dry skin area with the cowards and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is fully absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with cowards under the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area underneath (see paragraph 2 "What do you need to consider before applying Aldara cream?").</seg>

<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas on which you applied Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Most of the cases are lighter skin reactions that resend within about 2 weeks after the treatment is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, shrinkage, skin destruction, bladder, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes in the application location (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, swollen nose, flu or flu-like symptoms, depression, eye irritation, swelling of the eyelids, throat pain, diarrhea, actinic keratosis, redness, face swelling, ulcers, limb pain, fever, weakness or shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzymatic therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to the brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not decomposed and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, which complicate movements, reduced lung volume, heart and eye disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalization equipment, and patients may need medicines to prevent allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly examined the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was measured (by examining its effect regarding the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), arthralgia (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known and, if necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients receiving Aldurazyme regarding the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted approval to Genzyme Europe B.V. to transfer Aldurazyme to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long term enzymatic therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes in individual steps.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only occur in a reasonable clinical environment where revitalization facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 trial, it is expected that almost all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with care when applying Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, it is necessary to cautiously proceed as a result of the theoretical increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the onset of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to be treated in order to minimize the potential incidence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of mild or moderate infusion, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be weighed and / or a reduction in infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single severe infusion-induced reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed again by reducing the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate where the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or procaine because a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular intake of laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there is no data on newborns exposed to Laronidase over the mother's milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their prolongation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 or older at a duration of up to 4 years, are shown in the following table according to the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre-history, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, respiration and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a Phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with mainly severe form and duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients had a seroconical rendition within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, with a more severe form of macular circulation in the patients under 5 years of age (average after 26 days compared to 45 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or to premature excretion from the study) 13 / 45 patients had no immunohistochemistry (RIP) assay revealed antibodies, including 3 patients with whom it never came to serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of antibody levels had a robust lowering of the GAG level in the urine, while a variable reduction of GAGs in urine was observed in patients with high antibody titers.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low inhibiting inhibitory effect on enzymatic somatic activity in vitro, which did not seem to impair clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAGs in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies didn't seem to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme therapy is one of the hydrolysis of the accumulative substrats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study that showed the entire spectrum of disease, the majority of patients were of the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and ability of hearing in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically non-significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a HepAtomic acid before treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size up to the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear decrease of the GAG level in the urine (µg / mg creatinine) was observed that remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous manifestation of the disease between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined endpoint, clinically significant changes were observed for five efficacy variables (expected percentage of patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-long open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion (16 patients with severe expiration form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients, the dose was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- Mirrors in week 22 in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined after the Z-score for this age group. the younger patients with the severe follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe expiration only limited or no progress could be observed in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, research into pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing regimens on the GAG level in the urine, liver volume and 6-minute walk were carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a justifiable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged less than 5 years was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with a unique gift, toxicity with repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data will not reveal any particular danger to the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2341">This tab will give longer-term safety and efficacy information to patients treated with Aldurazyme, as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2342">In patients suffering from MPS I an enzyme called α -L-Iduronidase is found which splits certain substances in the body (glycosaminoglycane), either in a small amount or this enzyme is missing completely.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to one of the components of Aldurazyme or if you have experienced a severe allergic reaction to laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2344">An infusion-related reaction is any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see paragraph 4 "What side effects are possible").</seg>
<seg id="2345">If you are using Aldurazyme with other medicines please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chloroquine or procaine because there is a possible risk of reduced effect of Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines recently, including non-prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Instructions for use - thinning and application The concentrate for the production of an infusion solution must be diluted prior to application and is intended for intravenous application (see information for physicians and paramedics).</seg>
<seg id="2348">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "maligne" (cancer has already spread to other parts of the body).</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy in patients who have previously not been treated in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should take corticosteroids as well as folic acid (a vitamin) and injections of vitamin B12 during treatment with Alimta.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, a "anti-emetic" (drug against vomiting) and fluids (to prevent a liquid deficiency) should be given before or after the administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood picture changes or when certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed thus slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from splitting.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Converting Pemetrexed to its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of active form of the drug and longer active life in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was investigated in a main study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared to the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin had an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months on the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which cancer did not attack squamous epithelial cells in the administration of Alimta showed longer survival times than with the comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for the placing of Alimta in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each water bottle must be dissolved with a 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with Lo- Kal advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except for predominant hard disk epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is administered intravenously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion about a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of KOF is administered intravenously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">The reduction in frequency and severity of skin reactions must be given a corticosteroid in the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed offering as well as the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days preceding the first dose of Pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must continue during the whole therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) a week before the first pemetrexed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive pemetrexed, a complete blood picture should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of leukocytes and a platelet count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGPT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose check must take place taking account of the nadirs of the blood picture or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of previous treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if in patients after 2 dose reductio- or non-haematological toxicity Grade 3 or 4 occurs or so forth at the incidence of grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above, in comparison to patients aged 65, there is an increased risk of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a creatinin-clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min, which could go beyond the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin-clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3,0-fold of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-fold the upper limit value (for the presence of liver metastases) were not studied specifically in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with immunosuppression and Pemetrexed should not be given to patients before their absolute number of neutrophils again reaches ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophils, thrombocyte number and maximum non-hematological toxicity observed in previous treatment cycles (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hematological and non-haematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was moistened if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed need to be instructed to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce the treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous intake of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for whom a therapy with Pemetrexed should avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, preexisting high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid retention in the transcellular space, a drainage of the effusion before the Pemetrexed treatment is to be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 abnormal cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies using Pemetrexed if this drug was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated life vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible damage of the reproductive capacity is due to pemetrexed, men should be pointed out before the treatment plan to obtain advice concerning sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">High doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g. daily) can lead to reduced pemetrexed excretion with the result of increased occurrence of side effects in patients with normal kidney function (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day).</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is necessary if high doses of NSAIDs or ace- tylsalicylic acid can be used in high doses in patients with normal renal function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetrexed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data concerning the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piroxicam or Rofecoxib, simultaneous use with Pemetrexed for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetre- mixed must be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetrexed for pregnant women, but as with anaerobic Antimetabolites severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed should not be used during pregnancy except when necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to pemetrexed, men should be advised before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed exceeds the breast milk and unwanted effects on breast-fed infants cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the incidence and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomized Cisplatin and Pemetrexed and 163 patients with mesothelioma who received randomised cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2428">From clinical studies, cases of sometimes fatal interstitial pneumonitis with respiratory insufficiency were reported in patients with Pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2429">There have been reported cases of acute renal failure in mixed monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2430">Cases of radiotherapy in patients treated before, during or after their Pemetrexed therapy were reported (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is a antineoplastic antitorture, which exercises its effect by interrupting important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies show that Pemetrexed acts as an antitorture with multiple targets by blocking the thymidylatsynthesis (TS), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and glycinamidribcleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are the folate-dependent enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymid- and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomised, single-blind Phase 3 study by ALIMTA plus Cisplatin versus Cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma demonstrated that with ALIMTA and cisplatin treated patients had a clinically meaningful benefit of a median 2.8-month extended survival compared to those patients who were only treated with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the treatment arm in the treatment arm (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement of clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with malignant pleuramesothelioma was demonstrated in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) compared to the single cispla- tin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two arms resulted from an improvement in the lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / cisplatin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multi-center, randomised, open Phase III trial with ALIMTA for docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was median survival time of 8.3 months in patients treated with ALIMTA (Intent to treat population n = 283) and from 7.9 months in patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>

<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot metabolise some fats in food, thereby causing approximately a quarter of the fats which have been added to the food unhealthy to the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study Alli was compared with placebo in 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In the two studies in patients with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg in taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily patches on the anus, flatus (winch) with faeces, faeces, oily / oily chair, finish oily secretion (feces), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It may not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in graft patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It must also not be used in patients suffering from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract) or on cholestase (liver disease), and pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (BMI body mass index ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokalical, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18, as there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only resorbed to minimal absorption, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for older and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Chronic malabsorption syndrome • cholestase • pregnancy (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or high-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting treatment with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic must be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended that additional pregnancies take place in order to prevent possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-values (international normal-ised ratio, INR) could be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients who had been treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years stayed the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as the beta-carotene in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, it should be recommended to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure a sufficient vitamin intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a single dose Amiodarone, a marginal decline in the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of known side effects noted after the market launch of orlistat is unknown as these events have been reported voluntarily by a population of incertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to conversions regarding possible and actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">Most of the reported cases of orlistat overdosing were reported either with no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research on humans and animals, a rapid back-up of possible systemic effects can be assumed that can be traced back to the lipassinhibiting properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is based on the lumen of the stomach and the upper thin intestine by covalent bonds to the active Serin-rest of the gastric and pankreatical lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg orlistat was taken three times a day, blocking the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the effectiveness of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalical, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameters, the change in body weight compared to baseline value (at the time of randomisation), was assessed as follows: as a change in the body weight in the course of study (table 1) and as a percentage of those participating in study, who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their baseline weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight loss was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Average cholesterol in the Gesamtcholesterin stood with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (baseline 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% with orlistat (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (baseline 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">The average change in waist measurements was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (initial value 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, in therapeutic doses, not metabolized orlistat in plasma was only sporadic and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two major metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactic ring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-Formyl leucine-group), were identified in a study with adipous patients, which displayed approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot be seen as a danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxio is used in chemotherapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, which are moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is insufficient information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies Aloxi was studied at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 from 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, which are moderate vomiting for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted approval to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. it was approved by Aloxi in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloha is indexed: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnestial obstipation or signs of a subacute ion after injection should be closely monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is required if palonosetron is present with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the Qt interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi is not to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit tumour activity of the five chemotherapeutics examined (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytabin, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady-steady-concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population-based pharmacokinetic analysis, CYP2D6 inductors (amiodarone, celecoxib, chlorpromazine, cimetidine, doxorubicine, fluoxetine, ranitidine, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies does not exist, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common side effects of a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which at least might be associated with Aloxi, headache (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the appointment (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effect relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis trials were carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not an effective treatment for alopic overdosing.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, 1,132 patients who received moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cephalosin and &gt; 25 mg / m2 dose phosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 docx orubicin and 250 mg. of dolasetron (half-life time 7.3 hours) were given, which was given intravenously at day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the study with moderate emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the EKG effects of a palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations, a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area below the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional in the entire dose range of 0.- 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous palonosetron dose 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) compared to a one-time intravenous dose of 0,75 mg. however, the CMAx was higher after the one-off dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison with Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies for metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the isovienzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms per kilogram [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unaltered agent made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">The total number of patients was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance of 53 ± 29 ml / min after a one-time intravenous bore injection.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Admittedly, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal elimination hormone and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, but a reduction in dose is therefore not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects have been observed only after exposures, which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies evidence suggests that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and prolongs the period of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose was equal to approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily for two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is intended for one-time use, the relevance of these results is considered to be low for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) approved a negative opinion in which the failure of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug-sensitive component that has already been approved in the EU (also called "reference drug").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damages damages, moreover, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood are increased.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast that converts a gene (DNA) to stimulate the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that prove the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to 455 patients with the efficacy of the reference medical.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study evaluated how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after treatment of the treatment responded to the drug (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the drug and of the drugs to be marketed will not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon the disease appeared again in more patients than with the reference drug; Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the question of the extent to which the medicine forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected infirmations (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been detectable or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not have an effect against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years the skin surface to be treated should not be more than 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two to three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies the percentage of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients in placebo were responding to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together at home wound, about 90% of patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (eiterated cavities in the body tissue) or infections that have been detectable or presumably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo were outweighed in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the import of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of an awareness-raising or serious local irritation by applying saaminulin ointment the treatment should be canceled, the ointment carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Reapamulin is not to be used to treat infections where MRSA is known or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of reapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or worsening of the infected area occurs after 2 to 3 days of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on skinned skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole the middle saaminulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx increased by 81% after topical application of 1% Returinulin ointment on skinned skin of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adaptations are not considered necessary if topical reapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficiently related to an impact on birth and foetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Reapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of reapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / terminated, the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefits of the Altargo therapy should be weighed for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies in 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that used Altargo, the most commonly reported side effect irritation was at the adjunctive site, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Returinulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passangerianus (earlier Pleurotus passtick-anus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The effective mechanism of reapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub-unit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the transfer of peptide, blocking partial P-binding interactions and prevents the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of reapamulin at least some infection forms may seem questionable, advice by experts should be sought.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of reapamulin opposite S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of non-response to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Returamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion on intact and on scented skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% retapamulin ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling procedure took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake of people after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 of skinked skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml) 660 times lower than the Returinulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolites of retinaminulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were conducted over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro analysis of genetic mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mouse lymphoma-test and in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rats microphone test for in-vivo analysis of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility at oral dosing of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which achieved a up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application to 200 cm2 of skinned skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats, ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to ≥ 3-fold of estimated human exposure (see above), development stoicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity have been determined.</seg>

<seg id="2715">The owner of the marketing authorisation process is committed to carrying out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and included in the module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management System for human use," the updated RMP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area show you should quit the application of Altargo and talk with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not use any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if you were not explicitly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is out of sight on one of these areas, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occur.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambiisco is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged one to 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, and a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambient may only be used if there is a small risk of hepatitis B infection while immunizing, and it is ensured that the vaccination plan existing out of two doses may end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose of hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or other hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by "bringing" the immune system (the body's natural defense), as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccination approved since 1996 and since 1997 approved Vaccine Twinrix Children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and twins are given children within the framework of a vaccination schedule consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence of Ambiisco's application.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional 208 children study, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambić performed between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambient's degree of protection was similar to a six-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambiisco (observed in over 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain on the injection site, redness, maturation (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardisation plan for the primeval dimmation with Ambient consists of two doses of vaccines, the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher creation is desired for both Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-Hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-Hepatitis A antibodies (anti-HBsAg) have been found in the same scale as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured that immunocompetent persons who have responded to a hepatitis A vaccine will need a refresher vaccination as they may also be protected by immunological memory in no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should be available immediately for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units form-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemodialysis patients and persons suffering from disorders of the immune system, there is no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value under certain circumstances, so that in these cases the administration of further doses of vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal impinefficacy, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders Ambient can be injected as an exception, as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambiintolerance was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or combined with a combined mass mumps reindeer, the immune response was adequate to all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it is necessary that no adequate immune response may be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headache and fever similar to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomage and preservative formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines Ambient were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, Ambient's tolerance was compared to that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturation on a computational basis per vaccination Ambient, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed at 50,7% of subjects compared with 39.1% in subjects according to the dose of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of subjects who had received Ambient reported pain, compared with 63.8% in the subjects who were vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturation was comparable to a proband (i.e. about the total vaccine cycle at 39.6% of subjects who received Ambiisco, compared with 36.2% in subjects who received the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and maturation was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccines, the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambitious group was comparable to that observed in combination with the three-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA-units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambiintolerance a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines that reported serious side effects during the 2-dose injection schemas with the combination of 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at vaccinations at the age of 1 to 15 years, serum rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The dose rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambiisco and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogeneity was evaluable, the rate of seroprotection (SP in the table below) was significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3-dose vaccine was significantly higher than with Ambiisco.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were reached in a clinical comparative study at 1-11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-dose injection plan with Ambirix or a 3-dose injection scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In persons who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of priming, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction observed in this study was comparable to that observed after inoculation of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA-units of formalininactivated hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose-volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- to including 15-year-olds, it was shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies was comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme compared to the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose of Ambiintolerance was administered at the same time as a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussel, inactivated poliomyelitis, and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined mass mumps-mumps-radish vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formula in adults showed similar levels of seroprotection and seroconversion rates similar to the previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">Both before and after the resuspense, the vaccine can be examined for any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2780">If you / your child has already been infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vaccines (although you / your child will not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of the vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections affecting the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction may be caused by itching skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B, if your child has a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled administration of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend three injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second dose of this vaccine with reduced amounts of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and will give you / your child a vaccination protection before the vaccine is stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected by people who suffer from severe blood clots, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child is weak due to illness or treatment in your body's defense / or if you / your child is undergoing a haemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction is to vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Say to your doctor if you are taking other medications (including those that you can get without prescription) or if you have been vaccinated or have received immunoglobulins (antibodies) or is planned or planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambient, it should be inoculated in separate places and as many limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Typically, Ambiani is not given pregnant or breastfeeding women, unless it is urgent that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Please inform your doctor if an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic) has been shown to you / your child.</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ A very common (more than 1 case per 10 injected cans): • pain or discomfort on the insertion point or redness • Matching • irritability • headache • lack of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ A frequency (up to one case per 10 injected): • swelling at the injection site • fever (above 38 ° C) • Fezziness • gastrointestinal disorders</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects that have been reported very rarely days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (less than 1 case per 10,000 injected doses) are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include locally restricted or broad strokes that may be itching or splash-like, swelling of the eyes and the face, startling breathing or swallowing, sudden drop of blood pressure and unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="2801">Flu-like discomfort, including shivers, muscle and joint pain, seizures, dizziness, abnormalities such as tingling and "ants", multiple sclerosis, diseases of the optic nerve, loss of sensation or mobility of some body parts, severe headache and stiffness of the neck, interruption of normal brain functions</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambient is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which have become known since the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP argued that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambient remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambient has only been placed in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients aged over a month with complete enzymatic defect or hyperammonia-mic encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammoniacal concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is - split up to several individual doses of meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a Gastrostomia eschlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube) or a nose probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because ammonses could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo (a pseudo-drug, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia may also lead to loss of appetite, an abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste savor, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disruptions of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammoniacal levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "Ammonaps was approved in" "" "" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "" "" "because limited information on this drug was limited due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients with a complete lack of enzyme in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifest form (incomplete enzymatic defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life), there is an indication for use in the anamnesis of hyperammonia encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake necessary for the growth and development of the patient's daily protein intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of caricylphosphate synthetase or ornithine transacamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency should receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty in swallowing, as there is a risk of the development of oesophagus ulcera if the tablets do not reach the stomach right away.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore only be used with care in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolisation and excretion of sodium phenylbutyate via the liver and kidneys, AMMONAVO should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these findings in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">Subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate in young rats at high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) resulted in a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted in the human being in the breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS during breastfeeding is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAVO, at least 56% of patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) and at 78% of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAVO (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectal patient which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactate power, severe hypokalemia, cytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdosing occurred at a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which in an intravenous dose of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine that is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that a sodium phenylbutyrate that is taken for each gram is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglyglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the earliest manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infaust, and the disease led to death in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analoga.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative routes of nitrous elimination (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartum (however within the first life month) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease had been diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy was 100%, but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the ornithine transacamylase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is enzymatic in the liver and kidneys, in which phenylacetylglyglutamine is produced.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and with cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis by up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients for intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea-cyclic disturbances or hemoglobinopathies, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was no phenylacetate in plasma after nocturnal fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">Three out of six patients with cirrhosis treated repeatedly with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three single doses) were five times higher than after the first gifts in the plasma gas concentration on the third day.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The medication is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours of about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat had no more toxic effects in the rats treated with toxic and non-toxic cans (study 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules are taken orally (infants and children who can not swallow tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastroenterieslauch or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of caricylphosphate synthetase or ornithine transacamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAVO granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat flutes were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat) before birth, lesions in the pyramids of the brain cortex occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAVO (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectal patient which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactate power, severe hypokalemia, cytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disruptions in the urea cycle, it can be assumed that a sodium phenylbutyrate that is taken for each gram is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglyglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granulate form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were determined 15 minutes after taking.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of shelf life, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0,95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2,9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you carry out laboratory tests, you must tell the doctor that you are using AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you use AMMONAVO with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is non-prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you may not take AMMONAPS as the medicine could move into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headache, taste disturbances, impaired hearing, disorientation, memory disorders and a worsening of existing neurological conditions were also observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency department of your hospital in order to initiate a corresponding treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you have forgotten the intake of AMMONAVO, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>

<seg id="2873">After the expiry date specified on the carton and the container, they are not allowed to use AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2874">As AMMONAPS looks and content of the package AMMONAPS tablets are of whitish color and oval form, and they are equipped with the embossing "UCY 500."</seg>
<seg id="2875">30 When carrying out laboratory tests, you must tell the doctor that you are using AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2876">If you use AMMONAVO with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is non-prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS evenly on the same single doses or via a gastric paste (hose, which runs directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall) or a nasal probe (hose, which is led through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">• Take from the container a heaped measuring spoon of granulate. • Range a straight edge, e.g. a knife edge over the top of the knife-spoon to remove excess granulate. • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon equal to a measuring spoon. • Take the recommended number of granulates from the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, decreased blood flow to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) (an anomalous measurement value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiotoxin was compared with the normal combination treatment with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often used a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent the closure) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as cciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events (death cases, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or one year.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, Angiox was as effective as heparin with respect to all indicators, except for severe bleeding in which it was much more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox must not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudine, other hirudine, or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had a hemorrhage, as well as in people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that angiox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an acceptable replacement for heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd to transfer angiox across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST lift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in an emergency intervention or when an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out subsequently, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery will be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, an input of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous infusion of 0,75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intravenous IV infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolus-administration of angiox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt input of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed prior to the application and the dose should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is given properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">A lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose must be tested again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, included in phase III- PCI-study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the addition of Bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adjustment on average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 Patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the IV administration of unfractional heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalirudine is given in combination with another antigen (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the majority of hemorrhages occur in the case of PCI patients, most bleeding in arterial points of puncture can occur in patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), while the treatment generally occurs everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and being treated with Bivalidation, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regular Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after replacing the treatment with Biovrudin reached the level prior to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombocyte aggregator), it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of Biofrudin with thrombocyte aggregators or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters can be monitored regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experimental studies are inadequate in relation to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the delivery or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractional heparin or Enoxenin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the group as well as in patients treated with heparin, it was more common in women and patients over 65 years of prevalent adverse events compared to male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to the ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding as in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both mild and severe hemorrhages performed significantly less often than in groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidatdin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe hemorrhage was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemoglobin, ≥ 5 cm in the point of correction, reduction of haemoglobin levels ≥ 3 g / dl with well known blood supply, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed bleeding localizations, observed at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "Miscellaneous" points of points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with a bivalirudine in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the group as well as in patients treated with heparin, it was more common in women and patients over 65 years of prevalent adverse events compared to male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped together according to system organic classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, the treatment with the bivalidin must be immediately disrupted and the patient is closely meshed with regard to the signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains a bivalidin, a direct and specific thromboflavor, which binds both at the catalytic center as well as in the anion of thromboid, regardless of whether thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Thrombin to Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin is slowly splitting the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, there was no thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is verified by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thigh or upper arm or administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or the insulin can not process effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin is very slightly different from human insulin, and the change means that it acts more quickly and has shorter duration than a short-acting insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between 4 and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body insulin can not work effectively, Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adult type 1 diabetes, after six months a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was noted in comparison to a decrease of 0.14% for insulin secretion.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the decrease of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in human insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be used as a subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, the thigh or the deltoid muscle or to apply subcutaneous via continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal bell.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the decreased gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the need for insulin in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in the effectiveness of the brand (manufacturers), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production can change the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosing or abortion of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin that is used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyrus, fibrate, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of the adrenergic counterregulation can be weakened or missing under the influence of sympathetic olytics such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and spare-pin.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin occurs in human breast milk, but in general insulin is not absorbed into breast milk nor is it resorbed after oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed according to system organics and sorted by decreasing frequency of occurrence (very often: ≥ 1 / 100; &lt; 1 / 10; rarely: ≥ 1 / 000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; not known (frequency based on available data).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual creation or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, lightheadedness, excessive dog bats, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Wird fails to change the injection point within the injection area continuously, as a result, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous dose of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucoagine injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of serious hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (in particular by skeletal musculature and fat) and the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulisin the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu- manic normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 males aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin lulisin therapeutically relevant dosing range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional conceiving effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosey effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast acting insulin as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucose release effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a similar post-denuncial glycemic control is reached, as with human insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin pulses were taken in 2 minutes before the meal, a better postoperative control was achieved than with human insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin pulses are applied in 15 minutes after the meal begins, a comparable glycemic control is achieved, as with a human insulin analog, which is given 2 mixed cues before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin pulses with gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the beginning of the meal in comparison to human insulin analog which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the meal begins (Figure 1A) and compared to human insulin analog, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulzer with gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after) after the beginning of the meal, compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
