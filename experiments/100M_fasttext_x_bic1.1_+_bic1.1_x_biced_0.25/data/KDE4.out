the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite their small size , they offer some extra functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available .
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings expan@@ sions .... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard settings from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that perhaps more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package that contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or before comp@@ iling this package .
to use the crash module , click &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if available .
the Module Stra@@ p Filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Tools menu under Extras Monitoring Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ aller , all other node elements are sub @-@ elements of this root .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
tree @-@ maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . tree @-@ maps permit the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder , the size of a folder is set as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be detected when they are far below in the folder hierarchy . hence , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap account is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over view color mode can either display depth for the easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the representation of another file property like name , owner , batch or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough room to display , or whether the area is to be used by subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles ( whereby , therefore , you can specify the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle ) .
for Tre@@ em@@ ap &apos;s algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ ap , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target will not always be respected .
how spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this context , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space loss by frame so that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods are rows , columns or recur@@ sive divisions .
you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an assigned item .
originally it was &amp; FS@@ View ; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets designed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the picture gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras Image gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box .
the images per line has a slider and a screen@@ shot to set the number of thumb@@ nails in each row in the gallery .
with the file name of the image , display if the file names are displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
to display the file size of the image , determine if the file size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box , you determine if the size of the images is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the folder dialog , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders should be included .
in the file selection Save to HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved .
with the sub@@ folder sub@@ folder , you can set a slider or a turn@@ table to which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
copy the original pictures with the check box to copy if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery .
to use the comment box comment file , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box &apos;s own color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings offers easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under the navigation pane or with the key short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation section , and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback .
change browser detection adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; add browser and OS detection for individual domains . this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the standard browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Moz@@ illa / 5.0 ( compatible ; Con@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser , change browser detection to one of the following options .
changes the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject the access with browsers on the basis of Moz@@ illa . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to call up with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use your own &amp; HTML ; - Use elements and attributes , are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of this obsol@@ ete browser .
with this option , the set browser detection will be used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting .
using the menu entry ... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ cam ; download albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every media and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; contains a fast image processing with base image editing tools . you can use these to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can easily be extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( Hand@@ book ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ cam is easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG Export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens that can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ cam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement opportunities .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; tries to report problems or suggestions as easily as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests .... This opens a dialog with a under@@ lined short@@ cut . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; then we would like to invite you to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to participate is logging in to the developer mailing list . instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when editing &amp; editing ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data log is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like . &amp; digi@@ code ; will also be used as an al@@ b library . settings digi@@ cam set up collections
if you already have a collection of images on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; consider each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; recur@@ sively searches the library path in its entire depth . you can &apos;t exclude sub @-@ folders , unless it is hidden in hidden folder . this can be ex@@ hal@@ ved &amp; edited by inser@@ ting a point in front of the sub@@ folder name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and placing them on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My S@@ wor@@ Fast@@ est to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , it may also be possible . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help raw camera support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ cam ; download albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every media and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash , Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for the actual transfer to the computer , the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device . the camera can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever @-@ increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a common protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images using g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the preview images of digi@@ kam can be reliably read . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , preview images may not be possible or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ cam is how easy it is to extend its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in interface project ( manual ) is an approach to developing a common modular structure for the digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and g@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules for all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ cam ; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam itself .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
moving and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the tree , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or into another application window . the only limitation is that an image cannot be placed in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to lift the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the icon view . thus , the fil@@ ter@@ name works on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if it is displayed in the symbol view .
view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ es ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos managed by &amp; digi@@ cam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the album features or after the date on which the album was created first .
if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Im@@ ports pictures . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select album Im@@ ports screen@@ shot .
to copy or move an image from an album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . in the menu you can select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to select your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection that you set is used to sort your photos when you choose to sort or view albums from the tool@@ bar . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections .
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date .
the buttons El@@ der , average , New Year : these set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file in this folder will be used instead .
when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture on the album will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ Ste@@ quot ; This will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , select the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As a album preview , quot ; select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
album collections have a different effect . the collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window gives you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these previ@@ ews with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the tool@@ bar .
if you open an album for the first time , you must wait for a moment while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recre@@ ate all thumb@@ nails .
information on each image will be displayed below the per@@ tin@@ ent preview . what information is this , you can change settings , change settings . select the albums page here and adjust the thumb@@ nail area to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have auxiliary windows that appear . if you leave the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor for a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all the key features of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the section Intro@@ duction to the main window shows such help window .
pictures and tags allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you . image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can choose all the features that came with &amp; edited ; you can choose between viewing the pictures , a slide show or the editing of the pictures .
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 image editing ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... you will find instructions on how to edit your photos . with image editing you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; edited ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub @-@ menu of the file . to this , and how to adjust them to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing with other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the picture . some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . this way , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two possibilities for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Tur@@ ning . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click the thumb@@ nail and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from the editing box , it will be moved to &amp; k@@ de ; Del@@ ete . F@@ 8 Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete if you prefer to delete it , you can use Shift ; Del@@ ete .
&amp; quot ; My date sli@@ ste@@ es ; organis@@ es your photos based on the data . &amp; edited ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the data view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
keywords are provided with a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again .
if a keyword is selected , all photos that were marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also easily collapse parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword list , so that you can easily find the keywords that you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or click on an existing keyword and then choose a new keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this will be the sub@@ stit@@ uting word of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drawing it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking and editing keywords in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My sample letter .
to select another photo as an album symbol , select the picture with the right mouse button and select the Album in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to use keywords to deal with keywords , you first have to put your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword , click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My sample letter ; alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the previ@@ ews of the images and select keywords from the context menu .
you can indicate a photo with any number of tags . the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords related to it . this way you can give a cue for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event in which it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , it will be displayed in the main window under the thumb@@ nail preview .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select from the Tags menu Rem@@ ove from the menu . the menu only shows you the keywords that have been allocated to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per unit of time . a selection frame can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . in order to select a time frame , you only have to click the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which displays the time unit .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this then appears in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
ne@@ on er search box is a small lamp the green will be when the search finds hits . if you click here the filtering is deleted and all images will be displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you entered as a search criterion .
if you are satisfied with your selection , hit the head OK and the search will be done . the text box Save as is used to select a name in my search list to your request . if you want to change your selection after the search , select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select to edit search , the search form will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you select to edit as extended search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for searching .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu .
the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search for in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ cam ; s database .
the list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database . all rules are added by operators , added by operators . an option can be added to this list using the search group / search group . any option can be combined with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes every image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures . the less the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond with each other .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop every image to find a similar result . by means of a s@@ well , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand colour sketch : draw a quick sketch and a digi@@ cam ; find the right pictures . also here can be set a t@@ res@@ hold .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can click or zoom in or hold it with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull up a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides a lamp table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L Add to the light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opened .
from the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window . a small arrow tells you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you want to synchron@@ ize a preview from the tool@@ bar and perform a zoo or move operations on one of the pictures , then you can compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly sorting out of a series of pictures . if you are using pairing mode from the tool@@ bar , the two first images are automatically loaded into the fields for the same . use the left mouse button on any preview screen to view it in the left . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal del@@ e@@ tion actions also work directly from the lighting table , like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both preview images in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in p@@ anning function that you can recognize on the crossed arrows . to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you must click on it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the preview mode both pictures will show the same image area .
zoom in the same way as in other views . just use the zoom knob under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the picture and zo@@ oming in . this happens in both images if you are the same in the preview mode .
what is a digital inventory management - aside from the fashion statement ? digital continu@@ ance management considers every part of the process that follows after the picture was taken to the final output and the permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or digital photos saves a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect , and use photos again . we focus on the procedure for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , arran@@ ging , securing , evaluating , arran@@ ging , archiving , optimi@@ zing , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management adop@@ ts , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is , according to your definition , data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not even need to find a particular photo without stock management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you will definitely not use &amp; digi@@ cam ; . the approach to save metadata in both a database and image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do is build up information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive , or on a network drive , etc .
you may be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be quickly found on your location . the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date . if you make enough photos , you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; Export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a web page .
professional photographers have other requirements such as the version@@ ing of photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % working files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend to save metadata in the editing page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ cam ; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? to do so , &amp; digi@@ cam provides them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are , of course , the most important ones .
now the real work begins , since you should now assign any photo keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , since you can focus on the best photos during further work .
let us now use keywords , keywords , as you often name or categories in other programs . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ ged images from another source with embedded stit@@ ches , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically set the tree for you or place the images in the right place . re @-@ sorting the tree within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by drawing a sub @-@ tree to another .
the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very crude representation , since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
most people don &apos;t want to let anybody see your photos , they want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming , having associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you might even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others who look at your photos , the title might be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is it the meaning to transmit to the viewer , to help him understand what you understand .
it is fine if an image is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text as you want in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE also provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it Earth a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation drives already with speed of light .
the possibilities for explo@@ iting ge@@ olo@@ cation are already un@@ coun@@ table and will become even deeper in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys by means of pictures with geographic data . &amp; edited ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps Viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , i.e. also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and writer ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization may be used .
author title : associated with the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s job title . examples of this can be titles as : employee Phot@@ ograph@@ er , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or change this , embedded in the picture . for individuals , this is only of little interest for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . digi@@ cam has to provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : disk failures , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives too . in this section , it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics on the reasons for data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be handled carefully and you may not be trusted more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that requires a lifetime of 100 years .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliably .
CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faulty CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a convenient program called I@@ so@@ bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual player Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8.5 GB .
burn slowly with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non propri@@ ate format . then read the data again to check you . likewise , you should copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store them on a clean , dark dry and protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disc@@ olo@@ ur@@ ers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this topic : flo@@ ppy @-@ study
in brief : disks hold the longest if you operate in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temperature changes , the error rate increases dramatically . some of S@@ MA@@ RT &apos;s errors are the most common cause of failure .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power issue before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without any major problems .
while most electrical devices don &apos;t matter much , the devices with computer chips and high speed processors are different . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware alter@@ ation , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against power peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . it guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it offers protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage can use any cable to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors that also include a telephone line for your modem . others offer connection options for co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in an un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . some models allow you to store your data and run down the system . some models also allow you to keep the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and and compare its security with current problems with the cost to avoid these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . at the end you should always remember all cables to recognise before you go on holiday .
the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
you are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are loc@@ alized on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in the case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically corrected thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are deser@@ tification @-@ proof .
the diagram demonstrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs secure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst part is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred , not if this happened in your hardware . all of these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until one day you should open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . no one seems ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not currently concerned with transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes each year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates able to deal with plate errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will be available for &amp; Linux soon . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebooks and 46 % for work@@ station systems . not@@ ebooks already account for 50 % of theft .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage , for example theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted .
open source fil@@ es@@ ystems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : un@@ true , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common fil@@ es@@ ystems . find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , The@@ ft and Human Mist@@ akes are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical borders . it is also meant that while the technology develops further , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are heading towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is getting worse . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anybody responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so backup your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous , such as re @-@ installing your operating system , the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash will hit you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous enough for your data .
therefore disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , there is a frequent reason for data loss in spite of f@@ use the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete assurance and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . it creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup was made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
back up important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media .
this procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for the backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
themes : metadata , IP@@ TC data stored in the image file , retain associate X@@ MP files , retain original memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ find images and metadata , copy images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , vision devices , ... , use of the Internet .
so precious pictures survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is being said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while the time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way to make a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . if you have used fewer variants in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : each time you change your computer architecture , memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . with * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command to see if your new disk was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # change the size of the mat@@ ch@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task gets easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard the GI@@ F should replace . it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC mand@@ ates , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency .
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , one problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open resource format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and obli@@ ges to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon even use it at some point .
this may be one of the reasons why 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource lock quot ; technology of the 1990s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored using the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP works because it saves the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking to the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to reach a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera map , you can use this as a temporary f@@ use .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fine editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images back with &amp; edited , then you should add the metadata again . these have been cut off from the other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . just export them into web galleries , code into m@@ peg , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; edited ; in the addition of a photo to an album , you can add a description on how to add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; connect them to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . for some cameras this may take a while . if this is the case , the file name and icon will appear on the camera for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. on the camera .
before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the metadata includes the internal metadata , such as ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ cam ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then the selection of all download . this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ cam ; . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we advise you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired ones with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , you can download the button Download and then download the selected .
if your camera supports this , an option New is available for download . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , you will of course only download the new images .
when you use the button all or you want to download the selected albums , a dialogue with which you can select the destination album will appear in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of existing albums in the My Albums section . select the destination album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , hit OK , and the digi@@ cam will load the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can all delete at one time by using the Clear All button . if you only want to delete some , you must first select it and then delete the deleted selected .
please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera . you should therefore carefully check that the photos have been successfully deleted in a digi@@ cam , before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera qui@@ ver completely , you should do so using the camera menu as this is much faster .
cameras use as file names for the photos frequently not particularly meaningful names . the file names are usually re@@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can result in double file names if you upload photos of different shooting galleries to the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time on which the picture was taken into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transmission will open three further options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data to the author in the standard Aut@@ ori@@ identi@@ fier . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y % d % H : % M : % S in the editing field . switch off the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case letters . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ cam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the section Bar Wid@@ get metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , the picture is in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken , it can be used to automatically create sub@@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information .
this option is normally switched off , and digi@@ ti@@ sed in this case ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you have to turn on that option . use the Advanced button and select the option Date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog box appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , you ask &amp; digi@@ cam ; you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder cho@@ oser dialog appears for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to start up@@ loading . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in length and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be determined by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , user who can locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and map references .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format because this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ based assignment .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or other dates then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ al co @-@ ordin@@ ates created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to give you as much control over its working procedures as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to change the settings menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or set image editing . so you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ cam ; specify when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . also in case of database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s line : this field should include the photographer &apos;s job title . these can be names like a photographer , a freelance photographer or an independent , commercial photographer .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be entered here as the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this will ensure that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the &amp; digi@@ kam database ; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; edited ; imported without losing any lost .
save image tags as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests on a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; edited ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
the default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
when you open the illuminated table , these settings will be switched on if possible . some images , however , have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole picture size lad@@ en@@ quot ; you should only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better picture results with this .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar when you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more explanation .
with P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , since P@@ NG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
using the TI@@ FF files option , you can enable the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no effect on the image quality , because the default algorithm works loss@@ less .
if you select the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss free . even if you select the loss @-@ free setting , the relationship between loss of quality and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ cam , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the image processing settings .
the default is that all green pixels are the same . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensi@@ tively to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference causes a minimal loss of details . this option draws the picture a little bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . default is a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the top lights , so the parts of your images that are burned out due to the inability of your camera to catch the top lights in the settings . the setting colors trigger some unusual results , as it shows the top lights in various rose tones . finally , you can try to restore some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions out of the yet saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting option you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adjusted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the editing box ; in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the sub @-@ raw data obtained by the color @-@ filtered image sensor , which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
and digi@@ cam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ic @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts at the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result .
if you know the color vari@@ ance of your l@@ enti@@ ls , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color @-@ sof@@ tening correction , as it is carried out during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be returned . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information on how to translate colour information from one color space to the other , so that the colours are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when a picture is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files .
color profile folder See here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you can save all your profiles .
ICC @-@ Profile settings You have the ability &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to store . everything can be changed when opening the blank file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color @-@ mapping or gam@@ ma@@ ke@@ correction . at present , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you must carry out the color @-@ mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you print image , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may be very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon profile expansion makes it possible to identify the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; picture viewer and image processing . by providing this interface can &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will be loaded by &amp; digi@@ cam ; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the previ@@ ews .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper control adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn on or off the metadata that appears at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera features show on the left a list of all supported cameras . on the right hand side there exists a button automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode .
at the bottom you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and turn on .
if you don &apos;t , you can set the camera model and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it will be shown in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can paste them all here .
with the option dialog for moving &gt; Pictures in the tr@@ ash Perm , you can adjust the inter@@ viewing of &amp; edited ; when you delete a photo in an album , you will find more details when you delete a photo and delete an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without using any questions . otherwise , you will need to save the changes using the button changes .
you can also display the display of the presentation screen from &amp; digi@@ cam ; when starting , it may speed up the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
setting When Start after new photos promp@@ ts &amp; digi@@ kam ; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something has been deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar settings from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; contains a fast image processing with some base tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview thumb@@ nail and selecting the item View / Edit .
image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them may be used as modules in &amp; digi@@ cam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see Set@@ ting the Image Processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , which shows file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and current image size .
a tool@@ bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
the editing functions of the image processing will change your photos . none of the features will change the original photo before you have used the Save or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Rep@@ licate button or the button The Rest@@ ore the Image Processing Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since last saving .
virtually any action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by editing or restoring from the Edit menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to remember .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; using the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image , image , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo in and out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the click menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select the magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you come to the normal view where you use the Es@@ c key . normally , the tool@@ bar is displayed . if you don &apos;t want this , you can edit it in the editing dialog of &amp; digi@@ cam ; view the main window . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select print Assistant from the Album Export menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the main window has a side@@ bar on the right , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , without the navigation arrows , also in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab will let the side@@ bar appear or disappear again .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ CC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only supports ASCII characters and is limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated to 2000 characters and special characters are re @-@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented on it , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the let@@ tering will then be saved .
besides the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database , but you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate several images at the same time , select this and use the context menu .
the valuation is written in the IP@@ TC @-@ field of Re@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the table below :
the keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keywords tree , and a selection box with the keywords used before ; -@@ session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the keyword you entered . you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords for a series of pictures . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image will be stored in the keyword field keyword .
if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keywords tree , this will only apply to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a keyword , please read the section keyword filter .
the Key@@ word Filter side bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more key words are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created words are available .
you can also draw and disc@@ ard keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears which asks you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the word@@ filter is based on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . you have been selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword is drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be turned off in settings Vari@@ ed .
if you have a rule with and created and note that it would have to be one or its , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry you search for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
you can , for example , set an Advanced search on all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group@@ ing button . the options then look as follows :

this article / Tut@@ orial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actual photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colours that you print or publish from your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point in the image processing work@@ flows . the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you should make sure to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired outcome .
if your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other educational expenses are by email or the web where s@@ RGB is de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB so works well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and thus have to think about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and then click Info and then click Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to add my monitor when I have decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to screen your monitor because s@@ RGB mer@@ ges that your monitor is cal@@ li@@ fied by s@@ RGB . if you work as a s@@ RGB colour space , then you either need to add your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before trying any further manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Automatic Balance and Con@@ trast Exp@@ and from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ise Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the Leu@@ st@@ acker values across the entire image , leaving the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot as bright as possible without changing its shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced .
the same : this method adju@@ sts the light intensity factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces just tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation , which either causes miracles in one image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic matching : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and bright border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area .
enhance Con@@ trast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new @-@ ji@@ usti@@ fication of all values in between . this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
white balance from &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited as a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color is worked . if you can be too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry color white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right , a hist@@ ogram is shown that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixel very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called lumin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow alignment can be improved or di@@ mming down the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then anywhere on the picture preview to use the color chosen for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the Pre@@ ferences list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result displayed in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set can save you in a text file and then load again later .
the Pre@@ ferences button will reset all filter values to their default values and the neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding needs more disk space , computing time and is available only for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter Color Management .
another important tool is to find tone correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , allowing you to use them for multiple photos at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always need the same error and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the tool color effects provide four colour effects , a solar energy effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that arose when a partially developed print explo@@ ded a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . the colored , darker areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . the result was a partial negative of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase eventually creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar energy effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that works the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ in ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , it beauti@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a color film that is optimized for daylight by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ in ; and hence a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and therefore it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos . you can look at the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ Stren@@ g@@ th / Con@@ trast / G@@ amma , the tool ton@@ er correction is located to improve exposure . even if dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you will need only the scope of the slider for the purpose described here . concrete the three slides below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected range . under the graph , three slides are cli@@ cked into which to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate is to move the knob and watch out how the image changes .
on the right , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically , based on the settings of the picture . on the left side , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ m@@ ical Y axis . for images of a digital camera , linear representation is often the most useful . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case log@@ arith@@ mic division is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma @-@ values .
the three colour pin@@ boards can be used in preview of the original picture to automatically adjust the input of shadows , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . the compression of the output values can , for example , be used to create a light image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatic : this button automatically sets the image values depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ette , the input is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun tones . enable the colour pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to preview the settings of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
the left side shows half of the original and the target image . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right @-@ hand side :
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel modified by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is mostly the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , for example the bright sounds , you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker tones and that the corresponding image pixel gets darker .
if you want to shift this selection to the area you want to change , a matching line will be displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p cur@@ vy format .
when using this method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ette buttons , you automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shade , means and sun tones . check the colour pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color h@@ ues of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and impact . the left part of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison with your own rider .
a preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction permit you to mix these channels . if you enable lumin@@ ance , the picture will retain the general brightness as well , as the channel mixer is then THE tool to generate great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . colour space is made up of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the colour space first .
stores as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save any mixer settings for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is shown in ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since colour pictures can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film rolls profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks great , with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure using a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at day@@ time . similarly , like the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow l@@ enti@@ l filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
this is very similar to the process of stopping a pressure and the re@@ development in a squ@@ am@@ at@@ ron . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ co@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ qui@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tool Mak@@ ing Tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; apply decorative textures to a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a Pop Art portrait of enlarged points or as a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect is applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the relief model has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; add tool frames can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to retain his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture . throughout the picture with a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white pictures ) , sh@@ kant@@ et surrounds it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame .
width : width of frame in percent . the width of the frame is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target picture decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio cut beforehand .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple one format@@ ted text into an image at any position . this can also be done at several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . the bigger the image , the bigger the character set must be . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the image has been saved once , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool template apply you can place a template over a picture .
the image template apply in image processing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions concerning size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to decrease the file size of the template . if you want to add your template from the digi@@ cam ; Mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you will need to set up your template folder with the button &quot; Fol@@ der Fol@@ der . &quot; select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the template tool@@ bar .
there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but it produces gra@@ iny images , especially in dark areas .
shar@@ per mask operates on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it sharp@@ ens no little bit , it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ or and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for custom@@ ization .
images without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process has to combine colors with only minimal differences to one color point . this in turn causes sharp edges to blu@@ r a bit . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally need more after sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners are already using an image filter while reading the image . if you disable it , you will get control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing value . this allows you to use the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sharp@@ ness .
however , you should carefully handle this because the results do not work very naturally : the sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image is re@@ focusing the tool .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little bit sof@@ tly is much easier than sharpen@@ ing it . use the tool to adjust the soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t soft draw and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount ampli@@ fies the effect . if you make the blu@@ r mask too strong , ru@@ stle and impression of gr@@ ates will produce near sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold is a frac@@ ture from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference @-@ amount . thus , one can define a minimal difference with it for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from shar@@ pen and therefore f@@ law errors in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mask . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted filtering algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool attempts to shar@@ pen an image &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ us@@ quot ; in which it revers@@ es the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienn@@ ese filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blu@@ r mask . re@@ focuss@@ ing achieves mostly better results than blur@@ red .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ ies which are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vienn@@ ese In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos; fold is actually very strongly influenced by far away pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should be 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , and eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the filter can accept values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , and eg ; 0 , the image quality is very bad . a good value is 0,@@ 03 .
G@@ auss &apos;@@ sche Focus : this is the radius for the palate . use this if your blu@@ r is Gau@@ ß &apos; sch . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the palate . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any more focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity corrections in the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
in general , blur@@ ring produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by arming mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Vienn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the blu@@ r mask .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters applied on a small un@@ focused image :
the original blur@@ red colour has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharp@@ ness correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the smoo@@ thing slider sets the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the tin@@ ted ink allows a modified colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust it here .
the Image error correction tool is one of the most widely developed tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool has various pres@@ ets as starting points to make the restoration easier . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ thing over the picture .
direction @-@ depen@@ dency alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes out evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoo@@ thed in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD h@@ iss is a high value und@@ ulating pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing ratio over all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going to go through . normally , here is 1 or 2 .
angle magni@@ fication &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never exceed 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal , but it doubles the run@@ time . therefore , we recommend it to let it exp@@ ire .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long time and drag a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the ab@@ ort button .
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with little art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo taken in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a unique black art@@ ef@@ act in the background that caused by a bad film shift during the journey . the original picture is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
below you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced settings can remain with the default settings .
radius checks the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can blu@@ r the image .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch in front of the filter to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , you may need to adjust the edge filter again if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again .
edges : check edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the total noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak h@@ iss or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend that you change color or lumin@@ ance in order to improve the image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process , which is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
colour : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend that you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically stronger , but also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter damp@@ ing . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering range responds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther if it is too high . it can remove noise and phase j@@ itter at the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for that purpose . all parameters for reducing noise , which you have set , can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little bit sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than sharpen@@ ing a picture . use this tool to sof@@ ten the soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t soft draw and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
digi@@ cam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long time and drag a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Stop .
the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera onto an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time textures are applied to an old color photo , which was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lights and photo paper . the original image is shown in ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; light pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ trac@@ ting method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the dark@@ shot button . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard re@@ members the last dark image and will automatically load it back in the next session .
the image area and preview can help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
cut : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the faulty pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ spot correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was magni@@ fied to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially in the medium and large photo format , often cannot illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) it reduces the corners and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses also show this behavior .
but it also has disadvantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 with aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to use the camera by hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also use an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as there are otherwise non @-@ shar@@ per effects caused by movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s filtration and colour or gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation with a Cent@@ er@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three controls you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the destination image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity loss at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or by chance of a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 , reducing it to compensate for a smaller degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting .
Leu@@ ch@@ Stren@@ g@@ th , Con@@ trast , and G@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction decreases the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric aber@@ ration of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of gravity adju@@ sts the distant edges to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be eliminated virtually .
general : this value controls the distortion strength of the second degree . negative values can be used to correct tone @-@ shaped distor@@ tions and cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of distortion . this value appears stronger at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter General .
zoom : this value res@@ umes the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
bright : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start .
the sound and cushion distortion should be performed before all cutting or size changes . it is best to perform this correction first . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line . move the cur@@ sor in the image preview to view the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Transform@@ ers cro@@ pping from image processing or using the zoom slider of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as pictures from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown in ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate the inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web site which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can set two parameters of film bas@@ kets and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film , the ISO control changes the amount of the film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green law@@ ns become white like snow !
since the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce inf@@ ra @-@ red film , especially the green channel it makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos since the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filtr@@ ate applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown in ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a type of aura in the top lights .
this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere released from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road @-@ photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to check the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , adjusted to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the movie effect effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ thing or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smooth 17 .
the char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage qui@@ z . the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized . pictures whose gra@@ dient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator el@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Grav@@ ure shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses an copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter Grav@@ ure is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important thing about the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows adjusting the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ tions . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and makes it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the shaft blocks 1 , the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Stop .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Di@@ shar@@ per : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ red : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels at a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
blur@@ r : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to be back in the background .
blur@@ red vision : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blu@@ r of a linear moving , z : B : photograph taken from a car or train .
sof@@ tening : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
shaking blur@@ r : blur@@ ring the image by random shifting of the pixels and thus simul@@ ating the blur@@ ring of an invol@@ un@@ tarily moving camera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp@@ ness : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finds the colour tank in the picture and wi@@ pes it out without the rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Stop .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture . this gives it a wet appearance to your pictures . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing to keep an area free from ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that is free to stay . if you start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen afterwards , the area will remain free from ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it in the correct orientation by mirr@@ oring or turning . you can find the tools in the menu Transform@@ ers Rot@@ ate or Transform@@ ers .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you zoom a picture and keep the details hot ? how can you zoom into a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached ? how can you inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose change size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
changing the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo resolution was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the new size is retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each template for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very quick with what it does , but it can take a very long time and drag a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop .
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . image editing allows you to create a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pulling the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut out . this will give you a good overview how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by simply drag by the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The C@@ tr@@ l button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is trimmed ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the File Save or File Save As in the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will be preserved .
depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as a high @-@ format or landscape format . in portrait format , the larger value of the height and the cross @-@ format width is assigned .
cutting the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are cen@@ timeter , inch or any other physical size . you can see , for example , a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can set the range for cutting to the maximum possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation .
the tool After aspect ratio will save its settings depending on the orientation orientation ( Horizon@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the translation help enable you to hide help so that you can better summ@@ ari@@ ze your images . these aids are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden center : the golden center is a division that relies on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides more liquid help lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye drops into the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not a tri@@ angular tri@@ angles .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles .
the Horizon@@ tal options mirror and mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic parti@@ tions .
with the Color button you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can become invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can fix this with the digi@@ cam ; image processing and the tool free rotation .
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are set in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right .
for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cur@@ sor to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function transform@@ ers from the image processing .
an elegant way to crop the image is the Automati@@ cally cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a bit after rotation . however , note the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed around a point of reference to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is slightly lubri@@ cated . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after which you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformer tri@@ mming from the image processing .
the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not a rotation , the picture is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
drag your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can rotate horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed to the right of the preview area .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool to adjust your image .
for a single she@@ ar , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two form@@ ulations produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after she@@ a@@ thing the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers cro@@ pping from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible at this point to give a list of all the file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
this is done using the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is specified in the list , the file will be displayed in the editing pane . you can change this list of file extensions , and edit it . in the Con@@ figuration section you will find more information on this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select even the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the use of data compression processes on digital images . redundant information is reduced to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store loss@@ less if this is indicated in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the shell format you can read from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the Con@@ figuration section you will find more information on using modules with &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ code ; with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in .
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ cam ; is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in capability to preview or edit movies .
go forward to the previously visited album in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you have gone back .

K@@ IP@@ I module exports a number of images into a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth .
if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustments with the white balance module .
many tools you need to make your photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; their description follows here .
use a unified di@@ alog@@ box showing the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you will see &amp; quot ; texture app@@ quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image . on the left of it allows five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper area shows the original and the lower for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and remove it on the part of the image from which you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the properties tab shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can click or zoom in or hold it with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull up a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes . the application can be used to manipul@@ ate color pal@@ ettes and to select and nam@@ ing colors .
the pal@@ ettes that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can either be applied to the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; Desktop ; -@@ Settings and hot User @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets , or browse the folders for files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the palette view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the palette view . here the colour name can also be changed .
to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is enabled under the Color button , the color from the color panel is inserted at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing was selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check box over@@ writing under the cur@@ sor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Cop@@ y , Cut and Pa@@ ste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line character , if another color follows . if there are three figures in the cli@@ p@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color sel@@ ector can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . until now , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that include &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the features of a well @-@ integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well @-@ integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ;

loading big graphs ( currently there are problems starting at around 1000 knots and a h@@ ack for representing more than these no@@ des )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is an &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graphs . in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . at first , when you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only contains the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
zo@@ oming in both directions is limited by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the uploaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be shown :
you can choose whether the graph will be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; can also mem@@ ori@@ ze your decision , so that later on . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Pre@@ ferences ...
if you open a Graph@@ ite file outside a current &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog .
at program start , you can re@@ open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as change later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
when you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be fit into this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph which is distributed across several pages without header and with another font
the Renew@@ able Download page gives the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been altered on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or om@@ it the program each time .
the page opening gives the ability to specify the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time it is requested .
the session management page gives the ability to specify the start @-@ up behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally . you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session ) or decide to be asked at each start .
the context menu , which usually appears at one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up additional options :
here you can choose between various &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z , are :
the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible as possible edge overl@@ apping .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the default for non @-@ generated graphs . it produces representations according to the jumping spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring@@ form model for non @-@ generated graphs . it uses the Fru@@ ct@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the node in a circular form according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog in which you can specify a layout command , then executed by a shell . the command should accept the Graph@@ ite file as a parameter , and specify the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format .
determines the type of graph@@ ene ( directed or executed ) and turns the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for non @-@ generated graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the -@@ mouse @-@ poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element with this mouse poin@@ ter to get more help to this element ( if any ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module can read images and provide tools to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner by the SA@@ NE project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE installed .
when you open the menu item pictures , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears in that you can replace the default duc@@ r@@ he custom to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the Scan button to read the image .
make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings might not be displayed otherwise .
after pressing the Scan button you have to wait for the scan to complete and specify the type of image file . remember that type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and hence creates very large files . you must also select the folder and # 160 ; select or create it by saving the image .
screen@@ shots can be created after you have selected the &quot; Import &quot; &gt; Screen Sa@@ ver menu . a window appears in which you can set various screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select The complete Desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after creating the screen shot , the dialog box appears with the options of the target image with the options already described above .
the K@@ IP@@ I module calendar presently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Res@@ p@@ ect : the participants of this list speak English .
this module will archive your albums on CD / DVD media with the K@@ 3@@ b burning program . you can simply select the files to be archi@@ ved . an HTML interface can be created for convenient navigation . also , the Auto@@ Play option is available for Windows platforms .
K@@ IP@@ I modules expand the program in which you are loaded to integrate additional functions . you can integrate additional menus , keyboard short@@ cuts and other capabilities into the program . you can install as many modules as you want within the calling program .

if you use the module for the first time you will be guided through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . so it is your identification to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . you will be presented the following page after a successful login .
just close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Y@@ ES , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r is started for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which will show the current access per@@ missions that the module will show . currently , the module does not support any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . pressing the O@@ k button starts up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server .
the Tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the picture as tags during the upload .
with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lia options , you can set the access rights to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos before up@@ loading will be changed in size . size is taken from the value registered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Res@@ p@@ ect : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I geographical loc@@ alization module allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF data of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I geographical loc@@ alization module provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization correlation . this interface can summ@@ ari@@ ze a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want cor@@ relate to the main window and go to the menu . the dialog at the top will then appear . to make a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with a GP@@ X file .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation takes place which shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done using the time zone . set your camera time zone here .
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the right data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then push the button cor@@ related to the inter@@ pol@@ ating .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog reveals the coordinates of a call to the next you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set by the displayed card . select the region and increase si@@ e.@@ Add this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Picture Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages conform to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums which are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right hand side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the range below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page will be displayed .
the tab@@ s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is extensively descri@@ p@@ tive . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ Show ,
the Album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images is also stored in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth , which of course also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nail tab allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album Ri@@ der for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press C@@ anc@@ el to break the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the generation . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and short@@ cuts . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual losses of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the color information takes place . this can also be found in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool that lets you connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Res@@ p@@ ect : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the picture you want to copy in the main program and then click the Import function . this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please take a look at ex@@ i@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images into an MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images into an MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show . afterwards , you can create the module via extras MPEG slide show .
the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting of the pictures or the contents of the list .
after you &apos;re satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value produces very sudden , a high , on the other hand very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should let them black . you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes , you can go to the creation of the movie with the button coding .
if a critic appears that the enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck programs on the right bottom of the button settings .
the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing gi@@ mb@@ p . this is for example : useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RA@@ W file that is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ color R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you &apos;re satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to edit your images frequently or otherwise use it elsewhere , you should not choose the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start conversion using the Exec@@ ute button . if you want to break this process again , you can use it to cancel .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing files automatically . this is helpful in case they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the number and the tim@@ est@@ amp .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the image smaller or bigger .
propor@@ tionally ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
propor@@ tionally ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
pre@@ press : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent .
after you have started the module , the picture window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images using a button selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right .
you can also drag pictures to the picture list and drop them there to add them to the list of images to be sent .
the pictures will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the images you can open the New message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject .
do not make sure to send too many images at a time . most email accounts have limitations on the size of emails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send mails if you want to send a lot of images .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used again each time you change it .
select your email client from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and added to the mail .
the P@@ NG format below the image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in images file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages , in search of errors . however , your email program will automatically start at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window appears with questions like you want to show your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option Open@@ GL passes in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant picture transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the option file name indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop . afterwards , you can manually interc@@ ept it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select make sure that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
the distance between the pictures can be set between the images . 1500 mil@@ lis@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly select another effect at each transition between images .
during the slide show you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left corner of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to switch you on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show .
at the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Res@@ p@@ ect : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your images and videos with comments , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse through them , see picture . as you can see by comparing them with the picture , entries are now available in each group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keyword .
in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images .
when you press the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
when you select another person , only the pictures shown on which both can be seen . through this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can use thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the picture , each person has the same icon in front of her name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to save your own preview image , that also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself .
to display images next to the names , select the button located on the tool@@ bar on the right . in the pop @-@ up menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not have suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you must specify which image to be displayed for each individual . in order to do so , you will need to open the image editor window ( in closer detail ) and view the entry category editor in the context menu . in the click window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you view the Search entry in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog at once .
if you enter a string in the label let@@ tering or description , the descriptions or descriptions of the pictures are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here you will find pictures depicting Jesus , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manuals but want to try similar features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog , in case you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start for the first time , or select in the menu help the menu entry k@@ Photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . after that , some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar displays you date statistics on the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed items preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date is displayed in the preview display ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , only pictures of this time period will be displayed to you in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a log of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two ways to create HTML websites with your images . one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is described ; integrated version , which you can create through the menu file HTML ... .
before creating HTML pages you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each section is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ Photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages you will see an example of these settings .
next , select whether you want to create a &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the overview page . you &apos;ll find more information about the export files in .
finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without a description . note that all images are exported from one party .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why this is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set up various resolutions for the images . you need to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified . so it can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transfer time . if it wants to get an image larger , it changes to higher resolution .
in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
for all of your HTML files , select a base folder and add a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select the location for all future pictures . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages were created should be started . otherwise , the web browser will be in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them to it . to enable the import function , see , correct , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings just described have changed all three to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you set in output folders .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create your pictures with them . however , if you have already spent a lot of time applying the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to go with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work does not go once more .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external ones . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file , or whether the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you can have all the images together and pass them on independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ in file directly from the Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file scans the images in two ways . first , it searches through the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you entered when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML @-@ export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can view from the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
if you copy the manual to the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
copying Automati@@ cally to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the export file option .
the last option on this page is maximum image size limit . if you send images to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size , since the .@@ k@@ in file would otherwise be very large .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Im@@ porting ... , it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the im@@ porting assistant is made up of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alise the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they correspond in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown .
in this manual you will pass through the various steps of ( 1 ) Speci@@ fying information about your images , through ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced subjects and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual you talk about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top folder of its images . this is a simple XML file that you can back up with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notes the folder where your images are stored and automatically re @-@ uses them in future starts . if you want to read another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu item &quot; Settings k@@ photo@@ album &quot; you can set up ... get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user manual , you will learn the different settings .
on the left , you will see six different symbols with which you can view settings of preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , there is a detailed help available , which you can view by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the option you want .
it describes how you can set different properties for each picture , e.g. people , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog , which is used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select an inscription and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog box options , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group are set up once in a group instead of all groups of a group as explained in .
in the list box you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you will find a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ cam and g@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can and are not described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page , which you can access via the module itself .
because the modules of several applications are shared among each other , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures The &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; Demo Database , you can either use the command line with the command &gt; k@@ Photo@@ Album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu .
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications put their images into albums . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates the order for some modules so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
it simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview right now .
besides the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here we go and k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you are using the category people , you will get &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do , so if you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture you see an example of a start screen as soon as you get &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar you will see the window with which you have entered your image database . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the entry pictures to show you an overview of all the pictures available .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to add any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the people who are shown on the picture , where the picture was taken , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text box by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , because you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , therefore , that the names used are moved up to find and assign the persons faster .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the Sor@@ ting icon on the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each picture individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are below the thumb@@ nail of the picture on the upper right .
if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to select all these images and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the US . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
in the picture you see a browser window showing the USA as an over@@ board . in order to show you that this is an over@@ board , a special icon will be displayed .
in the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry into a category and take it there to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the frames that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which offers , among other things , the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide the window . you will see this process in the picture .
if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images , or of all images if you have not set a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , this will appear in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and either click the Del@@ ete key or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now you will see the window you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use pictures without having stored them on your hard disk . of course you need to have the images stored somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk .
pictures depicting the right upper corner are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , the preview images are available so that you can preview them . however , you can not preview them with the picture viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and then copy them back to them . so if you want to avoid problems such as merging your images , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images .
in the pictures menu you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures in such a way that at the end of the ones you would like to make available to others and click on Ac@@ tual View in the privacy menu . alternatively , you can also click all images that your little sister can see , and unlock the menu item All out of the current view .
with this you have set which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , so that all images you have locked will be hidden .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the privacy menu .
please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , anyone who can access the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves to deny the view of private images .
the reason why you all of your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them at some point . for this reason it has a photo _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . of course he shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is to be displayed at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have several images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the keys image high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l ; S button .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is to be able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can click into the image and zoom out . for the zoom @-@ zo@@ oming , you can pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button you can zoom out again The Plus button zo@@ oms in the center of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . using the control key sets the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ oming operations that work for videos that are in and out are the plus and sub @-@ key .
with the script functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image using the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu .
when you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view this and open configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to select the image and view more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you look one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add pictures with features while watching them . features are the letters A to Z and you can place a feature by clicking the corresponding letter . in this you see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have set attributes to your pictures , they are available in the browser . you can see this in your browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do right now .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in dre preview view then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected .
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you can copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image but in the database . in this way , you can reverse your painted later .
in you can see a picture on which it was painted . to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture , select on the picture from the context menu . to stop the painting , just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully rule , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; you should have read and understood the documentation .
in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model Vi@@ ews yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to allow you to select the correct position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene before .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to take over those changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with error description . then you can correct the input errors and click on user or reject the changes with ab@@ rupt .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already includes the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross locally .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button to change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the Visi@@ bility level of the parent object or as an absolute value . objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their Visi@@ bility stage is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility level chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or under one view , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the right or left of one view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to map multiple views on top of each other , drag the An@@ f@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the flash@@ card riders at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to view a view from anch@@ oring , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the pane bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the connector bar . to prevent closing , click the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any position .
the current window view allows you to save window order ... save . it will display a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual is written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon Ren@@ dering the Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View Sc@@ ene .
a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview up to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the icons settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
every render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but meaningful is a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the sub@@ section and enter the picture cut to the rendering in the input fields .
in the quality combination you can select the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render characteristics can be found in the user manual of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
when a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to l@@ essen the influence of these errors . generally , images with this property look better .
when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , compu@@ te and connect &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super @-@ sampling comprises the neighbouring pixels . the second method is adaptive ; recur@@ sive because each pixel depends on the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method POV @-@ Ray follows a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the colour values exceeds the specified threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are further pursued and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on j@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; it calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams do not hit an object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly quit , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this will add the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert Source for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
when you click on help in the property view , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation for the displayed object . set the path to your retention and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type license plates .
you can set the object scope of the points to the grid in the contex@@ tual menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects , such as the sphere , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
if you tick the high level of detail for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections . this feature gives a better approxim@@ ation for the projections , but requires more time to render .
if you tick the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you cross the ground , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is displayed in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you tick the edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used to render the scenes . you can adjust the values for depth and t@@ res@@ hold in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can modify existing window assignments or create new window assignments . in the pane orders section , it explains how to create and store window assignments .
the drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing window assignments . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window assignments shows all existing window assignments . a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the selected window order . new views can be created with the Add button and select selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
with new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with card map you get a map @-@ card view together with the previous view and suspended the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , there can be no rules for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing tool@@ bar icons . read the documentation so that you can get an idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this tutorial , you first have to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit Del@@ ete . now you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of rendering the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the nam@@ ing camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
if you press the user button or the input key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you can see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view here .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( insert final body j@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite level as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button Apply or the input key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the level , although at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . when you render the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree carefully , you will find that you can fold the item for the bottom when you click on the + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . choose one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should shift the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens , where you can choose how to insert the object . please select first object . the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = ground pigment ) , with a click on the preview button you will see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the preview of the pigment will show only a matt black material , because you still have to enter settings for the pigment . therefore always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the header and the ball in the preview , just click on the user button and then click the thumb@@ nail .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should receive the following result :
in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this item twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , choose mon@@ ochro@@ me each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should already be done easily , since you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the input key or the button Apply ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the sphere would float above the ground as you have moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering is a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select first object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on ball pigment , then select In@@ colors and adjust the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press En@@ ter button .
the brightness effect and reflection gives already some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces even when metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of the possibilities offered to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that render the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the image is simply black . obviously any scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file you have created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last undo command . you can select this menu item only if you have used the edit item .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to add pres@@ et short commands to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set tool@@ bars . with this option you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; -@@ commands .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface separately , without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these base bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel @-@ based , using an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can indicate by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n , or the Return key .
you can set whether each image is to be displayed in its own window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing En@@ ter or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog In@@ sert - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ Show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , general and editing and slide show , you can set the way of the &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the key short@@ cuts can be specified for each window .
if this is selected , the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color you can adjust further down . default is not full screen mode .
when this point is activated , the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option , you will save the name of the recently opened folder . next start &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder will open in the browser window .
click the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can set up &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so set up that only a few of the file types can be displayed that can display the program as well .
with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines if the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 .
change the key short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed when no more browser window is opened .

open the input box for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ casing ; is an &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ cam ; picture editing . &amp; show@@ casing ; is part of the digi@@ cam ; project .
&amp; show@@ casing ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and modifications .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is a show@@ casing ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes its part to at least problems and possible improvements .
and show@@ casing ; makes it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry report you problems or requests . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and requests . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ casing ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a common user of a show@@ case ; then we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ casing ; however , you can ask questions about other users here soon . however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to participate in the show photo ; to join , it is to join the developer mailing list . instruction to enter the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ casing ; .
the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected .
the main window of the show@@ case has a side@@ bar on the right , providing important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side@@ bar in image editing . you can view it by clicking on one of the five riders :
&amp; Tax@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that can no longer be sc@@ anned and stored as images .
&amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer can scan and save images . &amp; channels ; can open a dialog for saving for each image or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by typing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; cann@@ ul@@ ite ; using the command @-@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options very well .
to scan an image , the user can start a scan scan first , then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window .
if the picture has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings , the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? en will lead to a demo@@ lition and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button will open the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if wished , before saving . in this case , the option Before Save a Pre@@ view must be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; images can be selected . dialog for saving for each image opens the dialogue in front of every sc@@ anned picture . if &amp; channels ; this is to automatically store them with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without searching for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without having to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images to be saved automatically and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is uploaded every time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; gu@@ ide@@ ite ; manual . the button Over starts the K@@ DE about dialog for &amp; cann@@ ul@@ ite ; the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; chann@@ l@@ ite ; .

below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global key short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking in the player window and setting up global short@@ cuts . you can set up the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ specific key short@@ cuts by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set short commands ... select .
you can set up existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . this will make your keyboard the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control centre .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common functions , which are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some of its own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback when the script can &apos;t be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are available and use a dialogue to show the user why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error : &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ruby ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; each K@@ DE installation should be included .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends aler@@ ts to all running scripts . for this purpose scripts are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script may also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change indicates that a new piece is being played . the script could now ask for more information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) with D@@ CO@@ P functions .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry can be selected . to add an entry to the menu , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) to remove an entry .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to , for example , save data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks &apos;s script administration can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the acquisition of amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file &apos;s rights :
if your script package is ready , you can attach it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; cr@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . you might even search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
you may have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which ones you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is right for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used , so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to experience your music anew !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used if you don &apos;t have any problems when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please tell them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . see the system requirements section for details .
activate de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without trouble using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in addition , when the option is turned off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ win@@ .@@ This option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with m@@ ood@@ bar support , which changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
drop voice files in the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with m@@ ood@@ bar support . if this option is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored to the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the preferences folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ Bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started when a browser is needed .
using other browsers : you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above .
save play@@ lists when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit and Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
keep the current piece visible when changing the piece , so that the play@@ lists window is rolled up / un@@ rolled to keep the running piece always in the visible window area .
switching to context @-@ browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . by selecting Custom fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray described section is enabled . you can select scripts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection user defined color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set up your own color scheme . for this purpose , use the color sel@@ ector for foreground and background color .
continue playback at the start , cause &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume play automatically with the piece at the spot with which it was stopped at the last stop .
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog box the desired font for the O@@ SD . the shadow box shadow causes the text to be shad@@ owed in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the colour spaces opens the dialog to the color selection . if own colors are not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the display text input field represents the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering the plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your needs . below you will find a list of available space moun@@ ts and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment to appear on the O@@ SD .
the flash@@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers also activate more settings in this card card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders .
browse the sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the selected and their sub@@ folders to be searched by music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders for changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : cause &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Add all found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination pad driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is needed in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : will enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed for the connection to the database .
the debit card last@@ .@@ f@@ m al@@ ig@@ ns the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
enter your user name and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
invo@@ ke similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters can be retri@@ eved to the played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) .
some functions such as the O@@ SD assumes that your window manager considers the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will , for example , cause difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file causing the crash .
most of the time , it is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version have been compiled . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable automatic off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least use no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens in case of a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be corrected .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in Met@@ a @-@ Info , but do not label them as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script resol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( shu@@ ffle mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) always look active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects will be easily forgotten .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the correct version first .
there are several possibilities . most installation problems are easiest through the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ cap@@ .net in the # Amar@@ ok channel .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please insert only one error if you have something to fix an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only an empty playlist appears . how do music pieces fit in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the user interface intuitive , the startup sub@@ window has been converted to the statistics window . you will find it in Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the list of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new rating column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press de@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select Von playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and drop it there , just like you would do it with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , the button playlist is stored . click on it .
probably lacks the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is available in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question is : Which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ M ? . as you can see , we support pretty much any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! you may use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which does not include any MP3 decoder in default ( due to patent reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat d.@@ mp3 , input key
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you are using the Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixers ( e.g. S@@ B@@ live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause and solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different link ( e.g. sink ) .
you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with the highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) .
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed play . read this error report . the magni@@ fication of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA installation file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ am@@ ers react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , it crashes and Amar@@ ok . why ?
after the installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . follow @-@ register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the IR@@ C Channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download and install ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all of the ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with follow @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report to bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to start playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before going to bed , then you will be arous@@ ed by the soft tones of the music that you have stopped prior to going to bed .
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles when you are on a different computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usability - Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your user name with your user name . this assumes your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size variable window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button turns a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the input button after a search in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search returned .

if you want to use AL@@ SA , please check the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and a lot of error reports .
probably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; newly installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you probably need a distribution that the development files are installed separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : don &apos;t use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .

I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
set up Amar@@ ok ... Output Audio output to the device . typical is , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :

enter the x@@ ine setup dialog now us@@ b @-@ audio and output is on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with arts will not continue to be looked after . you may naturally want to take this problem by yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed main@@ tain@@ er for arts : )
listen to music ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard , which is displayed at first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , this quick start guide will help you . with their help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to everyone else . the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and search your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok can be used , including creating a collection and playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Center . at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current track or current stream . directly below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sample rate of the current play . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining time of the play .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can change by the available Analy@@ zer by right clicking on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also included in the running text display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used for setting equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to set the play position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio operators . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you activate the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . however , don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they are all easy to use .
in the navigation area , you can find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right hand side is the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use , yet even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context @-@ browser displays different information about the current play . its look can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and artist . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ window is dis@@ car@@ ded . the information displayed there is now distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( extras statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title you will find the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to look up the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover pictures in the context @-@ browser , the cover pictures must be in the same folder as the current piece . file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng files may have arbitrary names , but pictures with the word front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also show cover images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ eces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the Recommen@@ ded pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five most rated pieces of the current artist .
you can set which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . with the right mouse button , click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last part , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album .
you can click all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also right @-@ click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , &amp; Amar@@ ok tries to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - only groups the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are dis@@ regarded .
group@@ ing Artist / Album - Un@@ til the pieces are arranged according to the artist and among them a further split after the respective album is performed . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under various interpre@@ ters .
group Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing album - All albums of your collection will be alphabe@@ tically sorted among each other and the artist will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces are first sorted by genre , including by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above but is additionally sorted by album under the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically collect your collection as soon as you change something on the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
there is a search filter directly below the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter is a drop @-@ down sel@@ ector with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection . you can choose from different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours up to one year .
clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser will give you the following options .
load - This cle@@ ars the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
attach the playlist - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you will achieve the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue , so you will be playing next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be stored .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for the transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player Browser .
all pieces of this artist burn / Bur@@ n on CD - This will send the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move files to the bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the selected album as a compilation , causing it to appear under various interpre@@ ters .
set up selection - Chang@@ ing a compilation selected album back to a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be displayed under various interpre@@ ters but again under the associated interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to handle a lot of play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the bottom part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection , which have never been played .
even created Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists are possible . click Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for connection with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist , sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the Artist list . when you &apos;re done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar with which you can pick music from an input URL . for example , when you type : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the file musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the hanging of files can be difficult by simply dropping the Shift key . in that case , holding the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place . as soon as you enter characters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button for a long time until the text box is empty again .
if you enter by spaces separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one or two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter OR between the search terms OR , search for entries containing either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then wrap the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not by entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also look for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ some search for pieces that do not contain something .
for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this is looking for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bad .
you can select the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then right @-@ click in the desired sequence on the entries . the entries then get a lab@@ eling with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left side you will find the Add that you can add to the playlist .
next , the buttons will rever@@ t and restore them , so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar is a unique , larger analy@@ zer . the re@@ fres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button on the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you will see in the player window over the right mouse button .
there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example , ren@@ al controls and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and setting up tool@@ bars .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it displays the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the overall playing time of all pieces . in addition , the status for rel@@ ap@@ sing mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by double clicking with the mouse in the appropriate display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist .
one click on this entry will open the window visu@@ alisation plu@@ gins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can launch it by selecting covers cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left side .
with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from :
the queue management received your large collection in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece to the queue , the playlist will display a number next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will be played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already present ( the details of setting up this later ) .

double click on the desired playlist , drag it to the playlist window , or click with the right mouse button on you and then select Download . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix all fill up your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist of Recommen@@ ded tunes will start with an empty playlist , and you have to add at least one piece from your collection , so your playlist will be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point .
the New button re@@ plen@@ ishes the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit the playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the ability to click Edit , and then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .

played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist so you can easily see which pieces were played recently .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will continue to grow because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick more than one playlist , it will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists selected .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking Up@@ load .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in one run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; typically automatic &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; in some cases it reaches &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet such programs are generally referred to as Ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio coding technology and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is benef@@ iting from open source and is in direct competition with MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ enco@@ der module .
fla@@ c : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible , for example , to de@@ code WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an utility that can convert between various audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ x Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : an auth@@ oring system fully equipped to edit , dis@@ assemble and analyze video CDs and Super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play back all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry will open the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As will appear with which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file .
includes the current project . if a project has been modified and not saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and modi@@ fying . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each non @-@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you were called for each project file .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each non @-@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it , as if you had called file closing .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the pop @-@ up dialog . this has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the Project View . if the current project is a data CD , the so @-@ added files appear in the base folder of the CD .
open the dialogue &quot; Bren@@ nen &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button Bren@@ nen , der &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you merge files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is meant for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already available on the medium .
this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a DVD , which you can then burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of copying a DVD with the help of the copy dialogue , so the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in its original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the whole content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD + R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
the dialog promp@@ ts you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not currently supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog promp@@ ts you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously le@@ aked DVD video can be converted . this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the content view and includes features of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is selected , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is checked , a small bar is shown at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the contents view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the media .
the table of contents allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head@@ line is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the commands available in the top part , you can adjust the key mapping to the bottom .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when the wizard is started .
open the Settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work immediately . this dialog is meant to person@@ alize and for fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
in order to use the D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or use the more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of task are more important in addition to which of the accompanying programs you give .
in this chapter we assume you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions common to all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVDs and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Media CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Media CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Media CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Media CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void dup@@ lic@@ ated ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can get a project on the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ String Name ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String ) void add@@ ur@@ ls ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void set@@ monthly id ( Q@@ String path ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String ) )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Media CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ res@@ l / home / tru@@ er / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read Audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on enco@@ der installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders who code these WAV files ( compressed ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss @-@ free compression ) are supported by default ( these enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into MP3 or O@@ GG format , or also in other formats such as the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all of these programs are usually available for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to install something yourself .
which coding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ der , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CDs ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the CD ; this program is not intended to avoid any copy protection . if not the firmware of the CD ; / DVD device protection , it is not possible to avoid a protected audio CD ; just avoid buying copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called as often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , it will be explained later by the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . step by step , for example , you can find more information about how this program is being used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the master tab@@ s for configuration of the program .
CD@@ DB request starts with CD data in accordance with the set up of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - if an enco@@ der has been configured in the code settings tab in the setup directory - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the standard . it must be noted that previously the enco@@ der has been configured in the code settings tab in the setup dialog .
open the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
open the setup dialog for the type of notification ( such as logs , be@@ ep ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ates ) .
opens the Main Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different card cards ( like enco@@ ders , to set up the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right enco@@ der .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such &apos; offshore &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit rate the differences are less important because both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high audio quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices exists .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 3@@ 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression ratio about 5.5 . requires ever 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate app . 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of youngsters , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that manually entered or fet@@ ched through the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / used with &amp; k@@ audio creator ; and the coding program to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files .
in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the key words ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audio creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button code in the wizard ) :
this is what fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where individuals can read / enter the audio CDs , so all the others can download this information instead of entering the computer itself . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent that from the &amp; CD ; information that is publicly available on the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music business can be har@@ med .
in &amp; k@@ audio creator ; actively select a check box ( sending one address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b may be used with another ( bog@@ us ) address as the one used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio creator ; set up for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( generally issued monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which read@@ out program is used to store pieces from the CD ; in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this has not happened yet .
to save the read WAV files , the enco@@ der and the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a enco@@ der , further information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading requirements and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not work !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords .
you should already have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can , for example , be found with a search engine since it is considered as a non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure the directory is / usr / share / cd and that you own write rights on it ( eg by trying to copy something into it ) .
the first section covers the basic setting up of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each read &amp; CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used to compression the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any reading of a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found once .
the device name is passed to the reader program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , the effective device name can also be specified . if the drive can be accessed with other programs , it will help you to view the / etc / f@@ stab file and / or DVD drives available there .
the map map General Settings . here there is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left / entered as shown in the screen shot .
only in case of incomplete information , please select , so that you will be informed when information about creating a keyword ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data can be downloaded automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; record found , immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ aming and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first . mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this path , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as regards the server , but as many fire@@ walls bu@@ ck the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take over the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously missing pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try himself .
CD ; throw out after reading the last piece : tick this to throw the CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored . if the field is not selected , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
typing everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a little long , under certain circumstances , something needs to be fl@@ atten to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted when needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of subsequent changes of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneous to encoding WAV files : with a dual @-@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to code more than one wa@@ v file at the same time .
this is it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have selected the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; running to the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the internet is built , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; CD ; repeated .
since we use a &amp; CD ; which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data obtained for a CD ; with success from fre@@ ed@@ b fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn to enter the &amp; CD data manually instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example will be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet been done , then the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the screen shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; can be identified as an audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , locate the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there , a window is displayed and you can select the database entry that best matches your opinion on your &amp; CD ;
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you will need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD @-@ Editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any adverse comments .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . consult the enco@@ der to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the read @-@ out CD ; this is not important in this example because we don &apos;t have the &amp; CD data anyway . for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the CD editor window appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . simply enter the title of the piece in any case and any other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; you have entered .
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the part list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each row of a piece . only the titles that are selected are selected . a simple click on the row turns the selection of the piece on or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All items at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
when selecting the selection process is started by clicking on the button selection , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what exp@@ ires .
click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to check the jobs . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
you will see this error message when you try to work with a enco@@ der that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been enco@@ ded successfully are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new record : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . this allows reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . with powerful machines the result is unclear . the used machine with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time appears in the top left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio creator ; today is within the c@@ de ; CVS as part of the box multimedia package . if you are familiar with CVS , you can download from there an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions contain , however , a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package .
this section is directed to people compiled from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it runs , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any indication of how it should continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive ) , or from the unusually short menu ?
what is it about ? if you read this , you probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; intended . whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion .
strange if you &apos;ve managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US maps .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows on k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
session support . when you exit &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US maps ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the File menu . it will appear the usual file dialog , with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the record from the pop @-@ up menu or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in case of several pieces , they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the slider back and forth .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display and change the playback speed . to restore the original tempo , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a play is played , a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item , interrup@@ ts playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text , others use lyrics and others both . some pieces don &apos;t have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be presented and even better : the E@@ rei@@ gni@@ Type is automatically calculated , which a song is used , so that you do not have to manually set the automatic text selection . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you wish to set an E@@ rei@@ gni@@ Type , select the text event or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files you summ@@ ari@@ ze . in this section you will see how you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking Cop@@ y and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the items in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to no other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection will not be saved . remember when you add lots of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add . it will again appear the file dialog , by which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the Automati@@ cally add to the collection .
when auto add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the select list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to continue to skip a song , select the next song button , next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right .
to reverse a song , select the Previous piece , select Pre@@ ferred piece from the item menu or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter since it is not stored when you leave &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates General MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ Map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano into events of the type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et , making a trumpet sound when originally playing a piano .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece .
every section may appear only once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that def@@ aults are needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not General MIDI .
in this section , you specify how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and leave it blank for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all the sounds that this instrument needs to sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun@@ shot ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot . to do so , add the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( ri@@ fle shooting ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is the term &quot; drum @-@ patch &quot; of the patch which represents a different percussion instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
like the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of rows is very important , as is the presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple keywords for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key maps are used above all to map sounds to the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look at the included Key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key map with the name Name for this channel is used . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch config option , all events will be ignored that attempt to change the patch on that channel .
for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch config option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the pitch Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio value indicates in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value n , it is converted with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM states that a keyboard which receives a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones higher up to one oc@@ tave . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a little bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; play around .
to use a MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . this can be found in the Settings menu , point MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you will see what sounds are currently being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed a tool , the button will no longer be green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views ( until now ) to display the sounds played . view the View menu from the View menu View menu : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can perform very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; You have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
make sure to tick the Automati@@ cally add to the collection beforehand . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard speed you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI @-@ Fol@@ der and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or go ( when I play a kar@@ aoke file ) , I only need to switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file to the &amp; k@@ mid window ; drag .
if you only want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection , turn the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . open files
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ Ther@@ . First you only want to play the first file . so , set the Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open your temporary collection exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , this encourages me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga . I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I do not have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a little time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an expansion of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me happy if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact you by &amp; k@@ mid ; however , before sending a MIDI file , you should contact me , because I might already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anyone for it . I would like to stress that I only keep programming because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia , for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Magn@@ us Pep@@ per , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ tho@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error notification or just a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course my thanks also goes to all those excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , it can be found on its homepage , which is located at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and view pictures . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you would have a sound card , except that you can of course not hear any music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always a window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / directory can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , you need to select the playlist from the playlist and select either the Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the processing mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation during start and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ j option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
the animation on start does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would distur@@ b the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; mim@@ ics ; / usr / k@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / gt ; / smil@@ es. ; In the list tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L the von &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; are supported .
there is a tab to configure M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured using the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file , like setting the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how to play a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even insert the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
for the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player must be specified as a service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the K@@ DE setting dialog .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be used in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . the started process is called cra@@ pp@@ layer . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
this means that a given back@@ end is always taken for a given mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by modi@@ fying the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file . for example , the phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used must be used and the TV channels . to do so , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port should be used . there , ports should be detected by which one is selected . the code to use must be found ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contained a dv@@ b inside .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , the following must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally , various names are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ ed@@ source are used .
are there any hints on how to qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is to run root after the device is connected . it is absolutely essential to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and networking support , and is used to compile &amp; ki@@ p .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . Unix @-@ like systems will likely rely on the package &amp; text ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for legacy systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD / DVD should be used .
the &amp; ki@@ p ; Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are part of the box ; website included .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ p ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the ki@@ p ; website should be made .
for questions or to compile &amp; ki@@ p , or if extensions are desired , this should be addressed to the ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; Desktop ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and custom @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about this , the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right choice : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , a La@@ ie ( lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it comes from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex is given , it is not the ultimate book for it . to be able to master correctly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the file starts with the command \ \ start { document } and must be closed with the \ \ end { document } command .
the Quick Start Wi@@ zard of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document .
documentation classes : this describes the nature of the document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Script &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : the character encoding of the system is set . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used auxiliary packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration , they only have to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( in compliance with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used when creating German texts .
new users do not have to worry about this . it is only a short description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by means of &amp; ki@@ lt ; there is a great probability that some mathematical environment is not closed .
with the automatic comp@@ utation of the surroundings , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; ki@@ lt ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to the closing of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by clicking on the respective object .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when you create your own &amp; lat@@ ex file . once a DVI @-@ file is created , it jumps and ki@@ cks ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ Viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI @-@ file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the available output art of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the back @-@ up search , the elements of the DVI @-@ file are connected to the editor and as soon as one element is cli@@ cked on an item in the DVI ; file , the exact opposite of it is ski@@ pped . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex is cli@@ cked , the corresponding point will be j@@ umped to the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with others is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
file monitoring : in this mode , the DVI @-@ file is at the f@@ no@@ vice &apos; , and it is not called by &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the fast construction .
when looking at the editing tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for the quick inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the quick structure of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ instructions for sub@@ division are :
the selection field Fur@@ ther is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , thread no@@ des or references . the available options are :
name : with this command , a term for a section , a picture or other element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection of a select field ) .
when using quote , a drop @-@ down list with literary inputs is shown . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last field of selection with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã © e is used for the definition of the font . it can be used for the main text , the foot notes , and so on . the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from the ground up by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done later in the text .
as soon as the source code example above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the simplest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Building or the quick @-@ release button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically exec@@ utes the storage .
if you fail to compile the document , you should search for the errors in the logging process . if you are using Quick Camp , you should start automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font vol@@ e 12 is created and only a few columns shall have another font .
the changes are supervised only within the environment ( from \ \ start { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many ways to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , bold printing , cur@@ sive printing , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the itali@@ c print and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a sentence can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } itali@@ c .
\ \ quota : creates a quote in the document . the quote will begin with \ start { quote } and end with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex is shown , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le is now followed .
once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , some adjustments may be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . at least a quote , a few places in bold and explosive pressure and a poem can be used to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor View or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( for the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , its window must be closed .
once the DVI @-@ file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
this files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI , file are the same steps as necessary for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed using the printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI @-@ file to other formats . once the DVI @-@ file was created from the lat@@ ex ; source text , the conversion can begin in wished other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the pre @-@ select search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI @-@ file .
&amp; ki@@ p ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do this , simply setup Modern under Options ... Tools Building .
in order to execute the pre @-@ selection search , the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor must be positioned in a line of the source text and can be cli@@ cked on pre @-@ selection search . the jump to the corresponding point in DVI ; -@@ Viewer is then eff@@ ected .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document from &amp; ki@@ ste ; opened and j@@ umped to the corresponding line . for this , you have to set up &amp; ki@@ le ; in &amp; Oc@@ ular ; in &amp; Oc@@ ular ; set up as text editor ( Set the Settings ... Editor )
if there is no error in using Quick Camp , an error may be present . if there is an error , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the logging file causes the source of error in the source code . in the editor , the def@@ aults of La@@ Te@@ X errors and errors can be used for jumps between the errors . the log file always speci@@ fies the line in which the error appears . to view the defective line , the error must be cli@@ cked on the error in the logging and &amp; ki@@ p ; jumps to the defective line .
as soon as the respective button is cli@@ cked on the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used for the quick creation of a new document . more information is included in the section .
hands @-@ on users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , stored and loaded to facilitate creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file is created .
when creating a new document from a new file , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in the box ... settings General can be set .
when creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the default one .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below will be executed .
&amp; tip ; used &amp; kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
for more information and its options , the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start working directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be called over the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains an outstanding description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use them as well as their syntax .
double click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ big@@ skip , \ \ par is selected .
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the Editor window .
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most diverse types of source texts and highlight these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color .
many assistants can add additional book@@ marks within the text . in this case , it is a separate way of book@@ marking within the text . the menu items &apos; Edit &apos; entries or the corresponding key attributes make the jump to the next or last jump mark .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; Even though it offers excellent possibilities , in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source tex@@ tes added ; special commands for their selection .
this extended meaning includes tables , lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source text . the only app@@ alling thing in &amp; ki@@ p ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two blank lines .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has extended meaning , since this command also has a extended meaning ; commands with an back character ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) will end up at the end .
to add a part of the document , it is possible to select this first and remove it by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; tip ; offers the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers with own commands for a faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ o@@ ving are the following commands to add the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ p ; is included in the description to edit select paragra@@ phs .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; ki@@ le ; for further commands in the Edit environment for a more easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to create the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to locate the surroundings .
if the cur@@ sor is located in front of or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command will close the most recently opened environment so that the ne@@ sted environment structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups specified by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ative bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ving closing bracket .
if the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly clip of a &amp; tex ; group # , the other end of the group jumps ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many ne@@ sted braces , the most recently opened group can be lost . this command will close the last opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple instructions are used as G@@ Ã ¤ r . for the beneficial implementation , the character is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the &quot; sign &quot; is used for two simple instructions .
this automatic double @-@ entry badge can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X to be switched on and off .
foreign specific settings can also be used ( for example , n german or French ) and thus German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , a smart line breaks . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , add not only a new@@ line but also the \ \ item command .
within a table environment , the line is called &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end of line breaks .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments .
some users want to sort the columns in tables environments and thereby assign all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) to each other . at the bottom of Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the above line .
even though it offers a good source code execution , it has been added in &amp; ki@@ p ; in order to include special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . there are three different modes . all of these modes can be set up for different working modes under Options ...
at the beginning a new environment will begin with the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to gr@@ ind the completion list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are nat@@ ely removed when selecting a command . alternatively , ski@@ pping marks can be inserted , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by means of a jump mark N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ st jump mark and then the desired parameters can be entered .
settings box ; set up ... ki@@ p ; Con@@ sist@@ ent settings can be made to these lists . you can select different lists of lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as users of the general language used .
command mode is not necessary for comp@@ utation of environments . it will always have to enter a few characters with \ \ begin and the inv@@ oc@@ ation mode will have a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for the execution of environments .
when activating the complete environment or the key Alt + Shift key , the command to process the environment is automatically opened and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient noise can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key .
once this has been accomplished , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ p ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added .
under Settings box ; set up ... ki@@ p ; Con@@ sist@@ ent settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the complete list of full@@ screen mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ completion . as an example of a drop @-@ off list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word completed by editing Ver@@ completion or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt @-@ space key , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large estates are not helpful for automatic processing . however , it has been established that many users in a document are written more than once . there@@ with offers &amp; ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written wishes .
this mode can be set up in the menu Options ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ fully Back@@ ed . here you can also set the threshold for displaying the completion .
the complete folders can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ p / complete / apps / ki@@ p / complete / fashion / the per@@ sian Home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex .
the Graphics dialog is designed to create graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered .
PS files are not as popular as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for the changes and re@@ ordering of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
in order to examine the results of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in groups in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Cre@@ ate , create conversion and create view .
for comp@@ iling the source text for the observer like the ey@@ epi@@ ece , or the other conversion can be used the key alto ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI @-@ file can be viewed by Alt ; 3 , via Alt ; 4 , and can be viewed in a PS file using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when the command is used , a viewer is usually called after the compile . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open every time .
a new project is about the project &quot; Neues Project .... &quot; here the following information for the project is qu@@ eri@@ ed :
when filling the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ob@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; ki@@ le ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed , and can be used in other versions of &amp; ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ p ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ p ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents , including documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather is a complete operating manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the correct document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; ki@@ le ; delivered documents and for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keyword arguments . from &amp; ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or clicking the space button will open the viewer to the document .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly and lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; ki@@ p ; is also available for different architec@@ tures of &amp; Linux ; - and Unix @-@ like systems ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X can be executed .

&amp; C@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures process you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command @-@ line interface , you generate random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature is made from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information you can make your emails varied and unique .
for day signatures , the same signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . for each day you use different signatures , as with the random signatures , you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you an empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . click the &amp; lt ; empty signature ; and add your new signature in the lower section .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mail privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select them first and then remove them from the File menu or click the icon with the red cross Rem@@ oval in the tool@@ bar .
open the dialog box . here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short@@ cut , select an action from the list . then click the Custom button on the right below and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .
for the use of &amp; k@@ sig ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .
all st@@ acking elements are listed here . the older the stack entry is , the lower its frame number . see the example below .
by clicking on a stack entry in the shown list , the cur@@ sor is transferred in the main window to the corresponding line number of the corresponding file .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all of these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base .
anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows what it &apos;s all about . let &apos;s take it a bit , let &apos;s give it a graphical interface ! no longer need to rely on a terminal ; just click on the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application is waiting for a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the required working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the folder in the other folder field .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; html files are deleted every time you run my@@ pro@@ c .
as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for this .
if the newly opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book then simply select the current work folder . if not , then select the current work folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be reviewed is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then let them simply hook up the current file . if not , they delete the tick on current file and select the file to be reviewed by another file - file sel@@ ector .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well formed , click the Well @-@ formed Review selection .
for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the definition UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG review is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then you simply leave the current file selected . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection .
specify the name of the file as the result is to be named . the file is normally stored in its home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , invite , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start editing plu@@ gins using the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when you add plu@@ gins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , use this path to find the plug @-@ in .
multiple persons often work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
top names and attitudes of one &apos;s own identity are important with regard to messages and ann@@ ot@@ ations . see for further information on notes .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see in for more detailed information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later , how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into CVS , or when it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
in the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ sat can be a team or sub @-@ project leader .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
it can either be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment section followed by Comment .
comments can be sent to a member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the team member &apos;s nick@@ name , role plays a role in the project .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses are invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages supported by DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are available via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , -@@ Speci@@ fic settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found .
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog covers some pages that are dealt with one after the other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with regard to tags , including car completion , can be changed with this . entries are :
tags : large / small @-@ write of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal case / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag XML files .
optional tags : when checked , tags , for which the closing tag is optional , will be added immediately after &amp; gt ;
do not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
automatically update start and end date : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accent@@ ed characters into the appropriate coding while typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting different types of files . the standard specifications can be restored using the Def@@ ault button .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created files or in other ways other than the file opening ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . however , this setting is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; generates backup copies regularly so that during a power failure or crash the document can be recovered from this backup at the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a cage ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
reset window settings to the default setting at the next start is useful when the user interface has been mess@@ ed up by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / un@@ locking views . it corresponds to the --@@ reset layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by means of non @-@ inquiries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode . see the different modes .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser @-@ node in the document , can be set into details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of knots in the tree , the frequency of the tree when editing , and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty k@@ not are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are available in groups , each one can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ rank short@@ cut means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be administr@@ ated . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from the third party , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part capable application , most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard directory like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , it will be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from version 3.3 , the error search was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept has been implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable Deb@@ u@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
when a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view where the content of monitored variables will be displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view where all holding points are listed , with time numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bu@@ gger requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger so that normally don &apos;t have to pay attention to it .
the counterpart to Deb@@ u@@ gger session starts the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to de@@ duce a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is shown in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and sending information about the monitored variables as well as the current line running . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without going into the features or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include afterwards .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and move to the next as if it were not the current one .
open a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is an &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a K@@ Part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that can be found at ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how to increase &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , adapt to your needs and how to help you become better .
document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag and descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic @-@ orientated led@@ ges of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and statements more quickly into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , den &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day shows . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the Tag .
tag files are nothing but folders . they only contain the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag files bear the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is presented in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can occur only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than the only element type above itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for class class . the name of the class for this class . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the Type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
this element can only be used once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . in addition , there are other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling in tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % day name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only occur for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
speci@@ fies the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( for example once per &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each field ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a only element type .
gives a list of elements that finish one day . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; -@@ declarations : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but look out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; . this will not cause a frac@@ ture , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ window to start and check tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
this feature is currently not available . currently , checking is carried out only when the Tag@@ XML files are loaded in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; Excel function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file will be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , reachable via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = turn 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings ... created . click New action to create the same dialog :
the key short@@ cut assigned to this action . with clicking the user defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ eine , the current key short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when the action is executed , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This allows &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to find the script in the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in your path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if von &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , only one instance runs , the text is unique to P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document , or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be entered ; in the input field input can be specified , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected Text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script , the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages are directed to the standard error message .
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create an own tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a tool@@ bar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to set actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the matching tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use them , enable the &quot; Edit tag &quot; dialog when available so that an input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Diagra@@ m Other Progra@@ ms ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size andern .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by the use of green ( green is mostly called off , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol will insert &amp; lt ; start@@ ings ; -@@ Tag in the current document will insert .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this happens via the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and select the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , if there are some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared for a better overview by some divi@@ ders into multiple groups . open the tool@@ bar to set dialog via Settings tool bar . make sure the tool bar you want is selected .
after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this will add the item to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the divi@@ ders support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by hal@@ ving all the symbols to make sure everything works .
after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened from the respective type .
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user , it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search for an existing documentation for the format / script / etc ; then you have to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # Elements in the main index Top@@ Element = Your description for those document@@ aries e.g. , PHP ; Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.@@ html , # Sec@@ 2.@@ html tags 2 = day 1.@@ html tags 2 = day 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , look now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out yourself .
note that the table of contents is directly refer@@ enced to a file ( and consequ@@ enti@@ ally at the top end of tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will appear ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but be careful &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files being replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function should be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of shared context elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your do@@ cr@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
if you are sure that they are good and worthy to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example what documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the disk resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or else whom . in different places there is an email menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the Scrip@@ ting tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ users can download them . to make a substantial contribution , we recommend to sign the resources for which there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this ensures the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the future users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your private g@@ pg key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource the input fields have to be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , before installation , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message will appear with the indication of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not yet by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in XML format . there is a simpler way to convert DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D load and Con@@ vert button . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that is to be used . then the following dialog will appear :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definition line : the string that in ! Doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with details of newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand these and gain full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the division is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . everything that is marked as global is stored in the joint folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which enables the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of a number of main areas : the Editor window , the construction reviews , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool@@ bars . please click in , and for more information on these areas .
you can click the right mouse button to select a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all tab , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , ski@@ pping to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right angles in the editor area lead to a further context menu on the processed document content , such as basic edit steps ( cutting / past@@ ing / paste ) , editing the tag under the cur@@ sor , or opening the file , if the string under the mouse cur@@ sor refers to a file .
at the upper end of the editor window are the editor &apos;s tool@@ bars . at present , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as default , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , for example &amp; lt ; insert it into your document , then click on the tag that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog box .
the construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open them and strip them . in the presentation with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation construction views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows administrators to manage files in the project by right click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be executed using the context menu displayed .
an additional feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are always available , local templates only for the relevant user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the spin @-@ off in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script .
with this view , one displays the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is set in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element opens a list of commands related to navigation and re@@ fres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application system aligned with the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two flash@@ es at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and any changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , files on your system . therefore auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have trouble starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H in front of your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimised for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , a stand @-@ alone , exten@@ sible mark@@ up @-@ language editor would ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer confined to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , well advanced on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be kept that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follow , in good use of free software , the idea of Why do anyone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this all possible , but allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for quick web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more details can be found with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , where the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . see the section on Tem@@ plates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / Project template folder , only one error is reported .
converted when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special Notes on &amp; HTML ; -@@ Note , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from cli@@ p@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ Note , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day .
switches the selection to or off . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your PHP ; -@@ script gives error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of script functions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
on and off the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter will be activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set Book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed by file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows , for example , to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de , and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , manage the project . see the details explained in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in Project You / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be set by setting actions ... and tool bars will be saved using tool@@ bar tool@@ bars , or you will be asked when asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar yet , you will be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it is useful if the entities of the &amp; DT@@ D are to be refresh@@ ed without updating the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags present in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu item in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; specific sub@@ menus .
currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is denied ; inser@@ ting tool bar is denied when this tag contradic@@ ts the rules at this place .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items above . click enabled . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activated .
select the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the posters ; version .
select the type of line @-@ ending identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh .
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes take time or cause un@@ beautiful graphics . the card @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
the changes in this dialog affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser .
al@@ ig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters , you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which add and modify the sequences .
this should create a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled in from top to bottom , as the entire directory structure for the rest of the project is completed automatically after filling the project name . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower case letter and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine you want to access , except for processing local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) is possible .
if you leave this field blank , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on the remote host &apos;s setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
let it be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started anew , no hooks .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise selection according to coup@@ ons .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files by hooks or , by removing the tick , exclude from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu tree with Project Properties in the sub@@ window profiles or Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders ) that are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to the above , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened . it can be read more about project views .
this can be used to select the de@@ bu@@ gger you want . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information on G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
in the lower @-@ window profiles , high load profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by pointing an own tree view for each profile .
in the Team Con@@ figuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , change or delete actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . you can &apos;t influence this behavior right now .
to open another project , select Project ... from the Project or the Symbol Project open from the tool@@ bar . open the Project dialog and allow the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files will find . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project management view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folder beha@@ ves as well , but the entries are missing and opened with ... in the right mouse button menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be da@@ zz@@ led to prevent removing .
remember that the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten on programs . this option is useful when frequent upload of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on disk save option does not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ load profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a full @-@ qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored , opened or deleted from the Project tool@@ bar menu or the Project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to their own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are best st@@ ov@@ able using the tool@@ bar menu . using and adding is different . the addition of tool@@ bars is treated below in the Add tool bar section .
tool@@ bars and symbols on it can be set either using context menu ( right @-@ click on tool@@ bar ) , where a new tool bar can be removed , tool bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bar can be executed , which can be specified , which actions on this or other tool@@ bar are to be displayed .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will also be removed and action modified which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set settings actions .. set .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , basically use templates such as a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you present for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually inserted in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the template @-@ tree under global templates .
documents can be of any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , special documents are made in appropriate sub@@ folders . a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in such a way to be efficient .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment about a final note up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire sites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . there are currently no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
design a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose File Add as template As a local template store ....
once this has been done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File Save as template to save your selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily dra@@ gged and dra@@ gged to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this , such as drag and drop or paste over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
in the file tree or in the project files , you can click a folder on the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and back up . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ tend he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically interact with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them to them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a drop @-@ down sel@@ ector with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led as soon as par@@ ental attributes have been attached .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template list . if a root folder is set to such a path , it would generally disable templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text block . if nothing appears , you will probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows pre@@ defined or im@@ printed text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying contents templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the matching he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source editor that can be accessed via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor when needed , in which the implemented changes are visible in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol indicates the default of &amp; PHP ; source text . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit it , the source text editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source editor as well as in the V@@ PL editor , and the cur@@ sor is activated in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL editor .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation applies : a small gap for fast calcul@@ ators and a big span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the web page , so the editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor is possible . the document properties dialog will also be called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this is to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , for example keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows the content change , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing the look of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change on the list is exactly as with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is not currently supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the corresponding file .
the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves like usual . in rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves peculi@@ arly . the marker works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the back button or removed key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags will not be removed , for example when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed from any other loop day .
some tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the Listen assistant are disabled . they will work later in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for analyzing style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be followed .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ iling , you need except &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db file compatibility mode , wai@@ ved holding points can be set in a specific file and row number and later activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g as@@ cer@@ tains the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path name . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top loaded style file fil@@ en@@ ame with relative path to the work folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is for example a style template file . / en / x@@ sl@@ ot@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
in this command , it is checked to a partial or entire match with a file named QNAP or a specified mode name . &amp; eg ; template is consistent with any QNAP that contains the template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a desired stop point must be resolved for the UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made a lot of changes while at the same time correc@@ ting the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program I used showed only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where the ind@@ entation might have changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently of each other at a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously display the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when merging the folder :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays exact differences and resist@@ s the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often need to check co@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more trouble when somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by just writing the file name of the first file . example :
K@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folders
open dialog allows you to manually type file names , select from the file browser ( file ... ) or select an recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog will show your selection and displays them again next time . you do not have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
if merging is enabled , the input field for the target is active and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily necessary to set an output file immediately . you can also do this later when you save .
the Settings button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison will start immediately . in open dialog , you don &apos;t have to select files , you can close the dialog with the ab@@ rupt button .
you can also drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you would only have to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : at the moment you can do nothing out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; pull out . only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , allow the mouse to rest for a while over the line . then a small help window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed using the settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , the color indicates which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when comparing three files . that is good in the next section ( merge ) .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . when differences are found in white characters , the color is displayed . in some programming languages , where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted in places where the respective source file does not have lines . if the line breaks are enabled , the line is represented with broken lines .
the result window ( below the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ change &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , every difference is at the same time a conflict which has to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed .
sometimes , by automatic merging or manual editing , there is no more line left in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; No row in the queue ; displayed . this is only a plac@@ eholder in the event that you may change your mind and perhaps again select another source . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may copy and insert somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources , ignor@@ ing the options or ignor@@ ing Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated as white characters .
navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page , side , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ beginning and C@@ tr@@ l @-@ end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the shared window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the merging and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation that you can skip to the current / first / last difference , the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture up@@ side / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture downward ) or to the next / previous conflict .
to copy the selection to the cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying is om@@ itted . however , be careful with this option , because you could accidentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the end of the source files , so you should not use them with bin@@ aries .
the options and list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically when loading and restored at the next start . ( setup menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides type@@ faces with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c font . if the selected font does not support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered sc@@ ast@@ ert . on these systems the button Pre@@ ferences automatically introduces an odd color .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when the tab@@ ul@@ ator button is pressed . otherwise a tab@@ ul@@ ator character will be inserted .
if you press En@@ ter or Return , the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board is no longer necessary .
you can select which type of line you prefer to save . the default value is the generally accepted option on the operating system used .
when comparing files , try &amp; ch@@ Diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all the completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others only save a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . usually , the character return characters may look identical , but then they may be disabled with different sizes in page @-@ to @-@ page comparison .
in the default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored , but in the result the differences are displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
in default , this option is disabled . comments in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will be displayed before continuing to jump to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white signs are less important in many files . note that the Automatic Sel@@ ection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled .
these options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and performing a merge . look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merging .
if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to shut down and restart so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global over the control center . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if this option is checked , the top setting will be used for all entries .
a short note of what is the local code ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you ) .
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which code to use for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , they may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to set the code for the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you &apos;d rather want to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arrange the comparison windows next to each other or over@@ lap . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes look at the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as pres@@ et names for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge operation , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut troubles@@ ome parts or correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it will first be handed over to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only in line balance . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program this themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line balance to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an ul@@ ular expression that matches all characters in one line . the \ \ 1 in the sub@@ stitution string refers to the found text in the first letter . the \ \ U converts the found text into capital letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all of them follow the same pattern $ keyword generated text $ .
while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line ab@@ outs . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Any sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so basically deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several sub@@ stitu@@ tions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead you can use something different like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ Aller@@ gies are different in per@@ l few details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre @-@ processor are maintained for viewing and merging . other operations only change the data that the line balance al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
note : in rare cases , if you are using a normal pre@@ processor , the line balance pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programm@@ ers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a suggestion for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate the merge and shows simul@@ ated changes without actually performing it ,
... exec@@ utes selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the comparison and merging of files . you only need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not the merge . to start the merge , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small news window about the current progress . if you cancel scanning the folders , only the files that have been compared to that point will be listed .
when scanning the folder it displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found while scanning is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can flip up a folder by clicking on the + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object , or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as seen in the picture above , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries , however , the colour is identical even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire contents are identical . then also folders have the same color . for folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ ti@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then turns yellow and later when it is old , turns red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started .
the synchron@@ ization mode is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folders are specified , and if the option synchron@@ izes directories is active . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user can only see visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied directly after merging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged , and select the new file instead of merge ( uns@@ afe ) is enabled , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files , but show the same date , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , the merging of the folders cannot be started .
while merging , one file is processed after the other . the Status column displays Fer@@ tig if the merge has been successful , and other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will show more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then in the three @-@ folder merging mode C will be used as the target , when B is selected as a target and when syn@@ cing , A and / or B will be used as a target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries that should be in the target folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options to skip over certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / resume in the list menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current input : select the action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
when non@@ conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options Con@@ duc@@ ting , Sim@@ ulate and C@@ anc@@ el .
choose Sim@@ ulate if you just want to see what would happen without the real changes made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , start / resume directory merge again or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , a corresponding dialog will appear . then drag &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; hit a fault , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem otherwise before you continue merging .
if some entries have been merged individually , drag &amp; drop ; these entries ( in the current session ) will not work together again . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings menu - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that fit the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . several patterns can be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ format@@ ted files are ignored by CVS , the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a previous pun@@ t. marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
for links to files : if the option is turned off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
for links to folders : if the option is turned off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links like normal folder will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ sions . ) This option is turned off in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of solved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large files to a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is turned off in default .
the files are considered to be identical if they are equal . this can be useful , for example , if the modification date has been lost when copying . please use caution . this option is turned off in default .
enables the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging files are selected in such a way that after that both folders are identical . also the results of merging files are saved in both folders .
if there are differences , instead of merging the newer file is proposed as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because it assumes the knowledge that the other file was not modified too . ) This option is turned off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension is already existing , it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal merge of individual files , not only merging whole folders . this option is enabled by default .
usually , the Fol@@ der @-@ merging view is visible during the merging of single files ; you can move the window @-@ divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can turn off the main window in the Window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory and the text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the -@@ menu . you can also merge a single file directly from the merge menu . once you save the result , the status will be reset to Er@@ le@@ eve and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : list menu : read new
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this allows you to specify the files and folders that are located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes due to the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder . then a file is always assumed to be a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the check option of the size . ) ( this is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently as a difference @-@ viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , right @-@ click on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the context menu .
usually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assuming that the input file is a patch file in unified format . at least one of the two files must exist . at least one of the two files must exist .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it supports only comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools called K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now they are compact ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs very long and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way or that they will go this way .
you compiled the program from sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will first be treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical .
the editor notes for each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information .
the effort for this has been too large so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger volumes of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text it is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c has left ; appeared and the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how you can use K@@ DE on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the latest changes can be found at ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties per@@ sist , please refer to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Del@@ ete ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift inser@@ tion ) insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replace the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder after changes to these options . )
this also means that identical files will not be copied to the target folder when merging them . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging them . ( the behavior is switched off in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) .
in default this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , to stop them or shift them . this works in both a desktop and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible in both a desktop and on other work@@ tops .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; p@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has to set up the two entries P@@ ager ... and exit . if however based on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the icon and the name of the application , as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ tops .
if this field is checked , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops will be displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
tick this field to the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is displayed along with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , eg . desktop .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
if this field is checked , the running programs will be shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces will be displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple , simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally let &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N @-@ grid , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops appear in a horizontal row , which is very good for the representation at the side on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , view and move the windows as symbols or with its content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select switch setup ... lets the dialog box appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have a write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator .
since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you will need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impairment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; gt ;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance machines .
when you start &amp; put@@ t , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag is shown in the magni@@ fied area of the screen . below , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . the picture shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to below as a selection window .
in the default setting magni@@ fied &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor as a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can indicate a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop@@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse @-@ line at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor setting . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is not yet able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ sor .
in the drop@@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this can also be done with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , or use the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection box .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it into a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the picture and much more .
when stopping the update causes the CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( very low , low , medium , high , very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short instructions for saving files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button Docum@@ ent again loading in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and size reduction &amp; etc ; .
it may also be used as a magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier , so as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual han@@ dicapped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click whenever the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor per@@ sist for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and cause any mouse @-@ click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click whenever the mouse cur@@ sor per@@ sist for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in Panel ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate pulling with the mouse . this requires a little practice however .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , the mere moving of the mouse can cause pain . if you suffer from pain related to the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you break the movement briefly .
if the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button em@@ ulated . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the drawing with pressed mouse button . the smart move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; takes a mouse click .
if Intel@@ ligent shifting is enabled , the shooting time is enabled ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the mouse button is waiting , before releasing the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse takes place in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this feature is enabled , it creates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , one click with the right mouse button . this move is stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but can be changed later .
if the sound appears delayed , you can drag &amp; k@@ de ; move to the sound &amp; multimedia center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select sound system and here the General tab . there is a slider that you set to lower the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the application button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last push of the user .
it &apos;s best to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with pre @-@ settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off at first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later post@@ p@@ one the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click will remain without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window , which do not represent a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should quickly be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . you can scra@@ pe the dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or the finger@@ nail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to move the cur@@ sor to where you want it . however , you can park the mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop if you want to have a ke@@ yp@@ ad . safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the smart move is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to select this way text , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it again or execute any other action by which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , simply select text by clicking on the one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse cur@@ sor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will always play when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the shift time starts when moving intellig@@ ently .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test add @-@ on for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and a loudspeaker , and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remained brief . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and who prepares the stu@@ ff@@ iness of the mouse keys .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling action to start before the mouse button is released . thus , pulling and dropping can also be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that dum@@ b users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can select sentences from a list with the conversation course that are to be spoken once again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) you enter the command , which is later used for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second hand , select the default text pass@@ book . from the text passages , you can often select used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you specify the dictionary for the word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can compare the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word completion .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a RAM memory of the sentences already spoken ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
when you have k@@ mouth ; properly aligned , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken set is attached to the tra@@ ms memory . you can select sets that are to be spoken once again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; This dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the side word completion and the side K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the flash@@ cards voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down field below the input field , specify the character encoding , with the text passed to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed unchanged as a default input to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your voice generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a voice service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the further settings will be ignored on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is an &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ em@@ on , der &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice output is available and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . choosing this option is reasonable even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text passages book or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of Instant speakers , the selected text passage is directly spoken and added in addition to the entry memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is entered only in the input field .
with the second selection field C@@ lose of the editing window for text pass@@ book , you can choose to automatically save the text passages book when closing the editing window .
save the book with the selection of text passages . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text passages book will not be saved . select Before Save , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book is to be saved .
the word completion page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word completion . in the main window alongside the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box where this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary to insert just written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly inserted words automatically insert into the dictionary , you can create a dictionary with your vocabulary through time .
the main part of the window to edit text passages is split . in the upper part , the text passages are shown as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passages , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , tool@@ bar or drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default storage .
the selected text will be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default storage .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected sets of the default memory .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands will be displayed . by default , the tool@@ bar is located directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is selected , a narrow gro@@ in is displayed at the bottom of the main window with clu@@ es about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the bar is located directly under the tool@@ bar via the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
probably you have not entered the command for the voice output properly or not fully . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for the voice output on the flash@@ card voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )
the festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and without further restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without further restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ tet folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ em@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text into phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax often swal@@ lows the last note of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v

the voice output da@@ em@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since setting of the voice generator takes place only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use Proc@@ ess@@ ary kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog , when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use it successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15@@ MB of memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on the individual on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , can print text by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored which the user can repeatedly spend anew .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; not a voice syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the machine .
a more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start the help center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service , which allows each application to read text over the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programm@@ ers ready to use their applications with T@@ TS abilities .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; kate ; even if it is embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications .
speech output is provided by the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program , which uses various background programs such as e @-@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows you to create language editions on the command line ( or shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility program .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .

in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can subscribe to the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / Mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility . the developers can also be found at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , Channel # k@@ de @-@ accessibility ) .
before you can use cookies , you need to install and adjust speech speech software .
at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card cabinet speaker will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card general will be displayed .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set several variants for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher would otherwise use the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer sp@@ lines for the same printer .
when you click on the tab tur@@ ner speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card holder is displayed . it will appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no more speaker is set up .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when there is no speaker .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a row further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ops system .
select here a voice type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the tab . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ats ; almost use . go back to the map and check if voice output is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) enabled to allow the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ats ; to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the learning system of &amp; k@@ de . click on the map Le@@ ading Gener@@ ally to open this card . here you can set some general options .
check this check box to activate the kt@@ ops ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card @-@ card orders will be displayed , and you can create and read text orders .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , runs &amp; kt@@ ops ; further , if the field of speech output is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is checked .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it will disappear again as soon as the reading is complete .
with the buttons in this row , you can start , cancel , stop and record text orders .
the buttons in this row can be used to read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied on all pages .
the card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and check the language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check the text that is to be read . then select the text that is to be read , and select Text from the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; head@@ lines and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; kate , the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ops ; runs . then select the text that is to be read , and select Text from the main menu . then , the voice output should start .
this also works when &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
Not@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de message system that noti@@ fies you about events set forth by you . you can also read the text of these messages from kt@@ ops .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de , you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , setting up a message when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supported a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu item noti@@ fications appears in the Settings menu of this program . the here possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml file is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed as pres@@ upp@@ osed in most cases .
filters are one of the advanced abilities of kt@@ ops ; for normal working with kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is processed before it is sent to speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation in order to replace mis@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to b@@ ypass certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the way filters work , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts .
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the Screen Reader has been read , the retained jobs will be resum@@ ed .
aler@@ ts have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the issue of warning .
news is the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . every order you send orders from the map sheet is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts which do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ops , this output is stopped and finished .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages , and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter process the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are implemented as modules . in the future there can be even more types of filters .
string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with pre@@ defined character cass@@ ette inser@@ ters that allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re @-@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; reform@@ ers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format .
with voice selection filters , you can send orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ops . if you have set a female voice for example on the card &apos;s card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE &apos;s messages on it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it will continue the text to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or an &amp; k@@ de ; message is sent , it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the bottom of the page . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the normal filters configured . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are executed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below setup di@@ alogs will be displayed .
you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns for the setting up of string replacement filters . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name , it must differ only from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Re@@ place . the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you hold the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key while clicking .
if a value is entered , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs will be given with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must leave you away . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID header 34@@ 32 indicates , you may just type in the copy .
the string replacement filter is applied to the text only if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the character set filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . so the words must be limited on both sides by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Phr@@ ases can be found in the deu@@ ti@@ ls package .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such formats . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility program must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the speaker selection filter , you can send texts to a particular speaker , which is set up on the card &apos;s speaker , or to a speaker with certain features . you can , for example , specify that texts from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is passed to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program sends , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the selected speaker .
if a value is entered , the filter is applied if the text contains the regular expression . is on your system der &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call this with a click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements . click on the button to the right to display the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your spre@@ ader settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection Filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ ets Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the language edition API , by &amp; k@@ de ; allows programm@@ ers to give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; Interface of the language edition API of &amp; k@@ de ; see the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

none of the so @-@ called speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my speech ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; format filter , but when using the module for festival websites , websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work at all . you also need to do that if you do not use this voice to read Web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ m@@ sch is spent . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be solved by a string replacement filter . see .

the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you can find in the associated documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the k@@ de@@ bau@@ mit &amp; kt@@ t package from it . in addition , you will find the source code from k@@ de@@ ported by ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ il@@ i , Zul@@ u and Ibiza .
K@@ T@@ TS also works with any syn@@ thesizer , which can be launched on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above languages may be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers in the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ops ; , for information not included in this manual .
the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program uses an adap@@ table modular architecture for speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile &amp; kt@@ t , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) , including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; downloaded from the source text archive for k@@ de@@ ported or downloaded the tar@@ ball you currently have created , install and install the program with the following commands :
before you use your speech syn@@ thesizer , check first if speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher works correctly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of kt@@ ops ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr will be developed in such a way that the setup of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is possible directly and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user can go back to sentences or paragra@@ phs , repeat , pause or cancel the issue .
for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is female and whose gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best speaker will be chosen automatically . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker , you will see in .
if you click Add Spe@@ aker on Add to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card speaker setup will be displayed . as an example , the installation of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . for details on the modules , please refer to .
enter the path to the detailed festival program . if the path to festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival . in the case of voices that are pun@@ ctu@@ ated , this setting will be automatically made . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these slider you adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some regulator and this is displayed in grey , the voice chosen by you will not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded for several seconds because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with bigger memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or forget to click on user ) . see .
if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed on kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the icon kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr runs not yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited rate . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card &apos;s ID .
with buttons in this row you can move forward or backward in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) .
with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the Audio tab . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . issues of screen re@@ a@@ ders , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the message types of kt@@ ops , please refer to .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been deleted &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled or kt@@ ats without support for the corresponding audio module ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the subscri@@ ber speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds approximately half and 200@@ nbsp ; % approximately the double normal speaking speed . so that these adjustments can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ops system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , choose Standard .
on this map you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . once the Screen Reader has been read , the ordered orders are resum@@ ed .
aler@@ ts have the next highest priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
news has the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks out messages . if you are &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can come with &amp; k@@ mouth ; still someone who enters the room .
a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue .
this audio file is played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings , and the expenses of screen re@@ a@@ vers if these are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ats ; to read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , run kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the flash@@ cards menu will pop up .
select this check box to turn the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and kt@@ ops ; read no noti@@ fications .
when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played are not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , are ignored .
use this drop @-@ down sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ops ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected Custom Text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the speaker you want . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is shown in the list on the list on the top of the list .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the Event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can specify the default noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the messages to a file . use the button Download button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events are merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of e.g. abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ml is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ats ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the standard voice , the festival uses in the edition of SS@@ ml .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ x ; % , SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . this can start &amp; kt@@ ops . this way you can skip or pause or pause on the card &apos;s card or pause , even if the speech syn@@ thesizer does not directly support this .
here you can see the stat@@ ute @-@ limit@@ er filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit@@ er filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add additional rules limit@@ er filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to do this is to try out the choice of speakers and select text to read . switch back the speakers sel@@ ector , select which speaker , select the speaker , change some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s choice changes .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then quicker to start reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function , you can pause or cancel orders on the card card .
for these reasons , the normal set limit@@ er filter is set up automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing .
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set limit filter retains the pun@@ ctu@@ ation .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ aders .
if you have removed the normal stat@@ ute @-@ limit@@ er filter from references , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
you can over@@ write the speaker settings for the application on the box of the speakers .
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card &apos;s speaker ) . in other words : no spre@@ ader properties are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the characteristics of a set @-@ up speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select this speaker . otherwise select the speaker that matches the original features originally set .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the speaker you want . if this property doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t enter anything .
select this check box if the property should have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set multiple markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language lies ahead when you know that a particular application text is sent in a different language than the one inserted in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the field speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click the default speaker button and then use Spe@@ aker , which is most likely to follow the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , the input is 0 ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get any trace@@ ability .

the audio output of AL@@ SA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . when I stop a text order , it freezes &amp; kt@@ ops ; on the &amp; console ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system there is the problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA occur which prevent simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed them and can use them in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / Vo@@ ices . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
in order for this to work , the program needs to be installed so@@ x and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thesizer modules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the card &apos;s card for intercom devices .
the settings for the subscri@@ ber speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ml . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; html ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ml conversion filter , and set up the subscri@@ ber speed .
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ t ; read the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce any mistakes , the x@@ s@@ l file for converting SS@@ ml to S@@ aber is the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags as well .
I have added your own label release filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ops ; no longer move forward or backward . on the prec@@ ep@@ tor orders will be displayed , the order consists of only one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clam@@ ation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . instead use a filter for the set limit recognition for these characters instead .

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; freezes if you stop a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read al@@ oud .
the so@@ x audio program is used for general setting of the subscri@@ ber speed , but otherwise it is not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can then install the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is already included on most of the Linux ; CDs already included .

before you start using the syn@@ thesizer , check first if your speech syn@@ thesizer is working properly . follow the instructions you received with the syn@@ thesizer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you must install at least one language . help with this can be found in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read Web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / li@@ b / Vo@@ ices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . therefore search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generated from it the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete voice output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival generates these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be produced from German lyrics Di@@ phone .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files won &apos;t be installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the / li@@ b / folder directory .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for german &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
you will find instructions in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with festival 2.0 , playback of the error correction is not necessary , you only have to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allowing administrators to manage network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network setup module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; Network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and the setting of network properties is possible .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module will be loaded when the Network Set@@ ting option in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this will try to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be identified , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and release . by selecting non @-@ re @-@ questions the setting can be made permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in the system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . by clicking on the button system management mode , you can enter the system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s :
the network interfaces will be used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices will be displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the tab network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface ... set up in the Device dialog .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Advanced Settings to display the dialog with further options .
with the selection Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are taken from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start , therefore no further adjustment is required .
with the option Manu@@ ell , the TCP / IP configuration can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desirable , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the Con@@ sole , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or turned off if required . switching on an out@@ dated network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
network devices can be activated or turned off if required . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
defines the IP address of the machine in the local sub@@ net that con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network where the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a machine with DNS support replaces a full domain command through the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host requ@@ esting ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will resolve this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator allows you to easily manage this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be sorted by selecting a listing and listing or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons Add @-@ down or down priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group hosts to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Servers dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .
the list Nam@@ ely known hosts describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list of know@@ led@@ geable hosts contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this version of IP is still to be replaced in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known machine has several alias names , press the Add multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a named computer from the list , and select Edit .... The dialog with your friend will be displayed .
it can be one of the following tasks , then click OK to update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network Set@@ ting are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes to be activated , the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution can be used .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; in addition , the development packages with libraries and other things are required .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given ; in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; variable configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace advanced knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is provided .
IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to run through in the near future .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address is to be assigned to a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact person running a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , usually addresses in the range of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes modified dynamically in DSL lines , so it will not be surprised if there is another content specified in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is dropped by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . a different stand may occur as expected .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar that also offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective packaging .
before a tape can be used , it must be included in &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; get back the tape and read the band &apos;s pre @-@ tension@@ ing information . detect &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t recognize the pre @-@ credits on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
if you can &apos;t find it , you will be asked if the index will be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched by un@@ folding the entry for the band .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; by changing the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be dis@@ car@@ ded without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; if your tape drive requires a tape to be format@@ ted before use , it must be format@@ ted before using the tape of &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy tape drives are usually preceded by a format@@ ting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; continuing with the format of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the band is automatically integrated and ready to use .
before you initiate the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a security profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
ri@@ ght@@ click the local file tree and select ...
once the backup is started , the dialog box opens for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for the backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the backup will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in any of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the check@@ out process has been started , the dialog appears for review . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the review .
if you have confirmed the settings for the check , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the examination procedure as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
before you can initiate the restore , the files to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
ri@@ ght@@ click a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the Res@@ et menu ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog box appears for Recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the restoration settings , the dialog will appear again . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the tape inde@@ x@@ file on the basis of the tape content . this procedure del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can re@@ compile the index on two types of the tape :
this creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a security profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all files listed under backup files , only the files on the same fil@@ esystem are backed up , such as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be stored separately from backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent from the others .
perform incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files have not been fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
if this setting is active , it transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command takes the load to the drive . on some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; block the throw at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when resol@@ ving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically dis@@ car@@ ded the band . do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . regardless of whether this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , share the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should contain only one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be administr@@ ated directly with &amp; GNU ; even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is an &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to receive information about your system , or where the system provides the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to receive information about your system , or where the system stores the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence , try to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first , the system log file - the system log - will open . it will not be displayed , and it opens itself instead of a small news window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely , do not have system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in / var / log , for normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or string . enter a string in the filter bar . the list of the log lines will now be displayed automatically , so that only minutes will be displayed , if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the log file system log , select the column process , and in addition , enter the name of a process in the system bar , so you will be able to show all the protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more noticeable color than protocol lines of step indication .
if you want to display only certain processes ( for example in the system log or in the sync protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server .
in addition , you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new upcoming protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the Window menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has an own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. You will find more current information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it quickly develops into the standard for the control of the program start when bo@@ oting the system in the Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone could try to change a machine to System V In@@ it without re @-@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . the Linux kernel first looks in / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. d@@ ort , you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you will need a script for any system service you want to start when you boot up the system or switch to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is started only once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port when you boot up .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places after the program and starts the first it finds .
the standard run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the default level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you have passed a little mess@@ ed up by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually run these scripts from hand on command line :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level that only lets ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , that &apos;s &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starting .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; using a mouse or other pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ ways to start ( or stop ) at this level .
you can also move scripts between run@@ way or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new area . to only copy them to a new running level , you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
sometimes the type number of an entry can &apos;t be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the numbers of the surrounding entries before trying again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ul@@ ator button to enable the different work areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cutting to the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and paste it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sort number or the name of an entry manually , press the input key to open the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ around , and now the machine is constantly re@@ started . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in the individual user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the standard run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ time X , but they are not executed .
if you are using Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary programming programs of these distri@@ butions , but does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution : please check if all configuration files are available ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are un@@ available or configured in@@ correctly .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ time distribution varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that it can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adapting &amp; k@@ user ; read .
after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or save the entry in the File menu .
the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user group and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties .
some flash@@ cards are only shown when you have advanced system settings . only if you have activated space restrictions ( quota ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings . other cards will appear if shadow passwords , e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD uni@@ x .
the password management card appears if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD uni@@ x .
this map only appears if the space limitation ( quota ) is activated and initi@@ alized for at least one @-@ time fil@@ esystem space limitation ( see the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with wild@@ cards using the field fil@@ esystem .
the Groups tab informs about the group belonging to the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the Group dialog properties include a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group , or click the matching tool@@ bar Add @-@ on . editing or del@@ eting the selected group or the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boat manager , add , remove and modify the boot password , change the time to boot the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
