<seg id="1">To translate the module web page, you will find in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras Website. select from the drop-down list the source and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part of the whole & URL will be translated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Native translations are only very rudimentary. Babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, no important decisions should be made dependent on the translations without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert too translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror;. despite their small size, they offer some extra functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making these easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings expansions.... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings from the box kde; addons. please note that perhaps more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package that contains & konqueror before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click & konqueror; on Extras crashes. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes, if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Module Strap Filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; Tools menu under Extras Monitoring Filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed page. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentaller, all other node elements are sub-elements of this root.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree-maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. tree-maps permit the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder, the size of a folder is set as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be detected when they are far below in the folder hierarchy. hence, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap account is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can either display depth for the easy recognition of the nesting depth or the representation of another file property like name, owner, batch or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough room to display, or whether the area is to be used by subordinate rectangles (whereby, therefore, you can specify the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle).</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemap's algorithms for Treemap, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView; this target will not always be respected.</seg>
<seg id="20">How splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this context, it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space loss by frame so that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods are rows, columns or recursive divisions.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an assigned item.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally it was & FSView; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of TreeMap widgets designed for the application of KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The picture gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras Image gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Picture Gallery module, a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box.</seg>
<seg id="26">The images per line has a slider and a screenshot to set the number of thumbnails in each row in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the file name of the image, display if the file names are displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">To display the file size of the image, determine if the file size is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, you determine if the size of the images is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the folder dialog, specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders should be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the file selection Save to HTML file, specify where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the subfolder subfolder, you can set a slider or a turntable to which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original pictures with the check box to copy if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">To use the comment box comment file, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box's own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings offers easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; -Settings can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under the navigation pane or with the key shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror navigation section, and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser detection adds a menu entry in & konqueror; add browser and OS detection for individual domains. this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Conqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change browser detection to one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for pages that reject the access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser detection to call up with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use your own & HTML; - Use elements and attributes, are displayed correctly with the identifier of this obsolete browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the set browser detection will be used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting.</seg>
<seg id="45">Using the menu entry... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; module, check your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; documents according to the recommendations of the W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">Check the website's website in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras "website. you can do the following tests:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; -Verification check if your & HTML; -Document of the syntax of & HTML; corresponds, all found bugs will be displayed. with this check, you can make sure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to check your & CSS; style sheets included in an & HTML; - or & XHTML; document. with valid & CSS; your web pages have a uniform appearance regardless of your browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Checks the links on your page on forwarding and incorrect connections. recursively all links are checked on the website.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you set the addresses of the servers for verification of your & HTML; -documents and & CSS; style sheets.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module web archiving system for & konqueror; you can save web pages with text and images in .was format.</seg>
<seg id="53">Use the mouse to archive your browser and it will display a dialog to save the displayed web page.</seg>
<seg id="54">The module web-archiving is Copyright & copy; 2001-2003 Andreas Schlapbach, Antonio Larossa and Malte Starostik schlpbash @ iam.unibe.ch larossa @ kde.org tries @ kde.org</seg>
<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digicam; download albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, every media and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digicam; contains a fast image processing with base image editing tools. you can use these to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the processing capabilities can easily be extended with KDE Image Plugins Interface (Handbook) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digicam is easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG Export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also digicam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digicam; tries to report problems or suggestions as easily as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests.... This opens a dialog with a underlined shortcut. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam; then we would like to invite you to other users of & digikam. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicam; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate is logging in to the developer mailing list. instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When editing & editing; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data log is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like. & digicode; will also be used as an alb library. settings digicam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a collection of images on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder. & digikam; consider each subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; recursively searches the library path in its entire depth. you can't exclude sub-folders, unless it is hidden in hidden folder. this can be exhalved & edited by inserting a point in front of the subfolder name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenList do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and placing them on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My SworFastest to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, it may also be possible. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help raw camera support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digicam; download albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, every media and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash, Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. for the actual transfer to the computer, the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device. the camera can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digicam; uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever-increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a common protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digicam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images using gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the preview images of digikam can be reliably read. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, preview images may not be possible or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digicam is how easy it is to extend its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plug-in interface project (manual) is an approach to developing a common modular structure for the digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules for all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digicam; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes in & digikam itself.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Moving and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the tree, above the horizontal divider line or into another application window. the only limitation is that an image cannot be placed in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to lift the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the icon view. thus, the filtername works on the filename only if it is displayed in the symbol view.</seg>
<seg id="85">View & quot; My Albenlistees; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos managed by & digicam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the album features or after the date on which the album was created first.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album Imports pictures. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select album Imports screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from an album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it. in the menu you can select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to select your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection that you set is used to sort your photos when you choose to sort or view albums from the toolbar. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can make this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Elder, average, New Year: these set the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or that of the average of the album. this will first try to calculate the average of the pictures from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last modification of each file in this folder will be used instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & digikam, the first picture on the album will be chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My AlbenliStequot; This will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, select the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; As a album preview, quot; select. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">Album collections have a different effect. the collection includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window gives you the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images will be displayed in this album in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these previews with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album for the first time, you must wait for a moment while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recreate all thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be displayed below the pertinent preview. what information is this, you can change settings, change settings. select the albums page here and adjust the thumbnail area to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have auxiliary windows that appear. if you leave the mouse-cursor for a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all the key features of a photo. the screenshot above in the section Introduction to the main window shows such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Pictures and tags allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you. image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can choose all the features that came with & edited; you can choose between viewing the pictures, a slide show or the editing of the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 image editing... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing... you will find instructions on how to edit your photos. with image editing you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & edited; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub-menu of the file. to this, and how to adjust them to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing with other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata contained in the picture. some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image. this way, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicam; provides two possibilities for rotation. the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Turning. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click the thumbnail and select F2 rename from the context menu. note that you keep the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from the editing box, it will be moved to & kde; Delete. F8 Delete or Delete if you prefer to delete it, you can use Shift; Delete.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My date slistees; organises your photos based on the data. & edited; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the data view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Keywords are provided with a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos that were marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also easily collapse parts of the tree & quot; My keyword list, so that you can easily find the keywords that you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking on & quot; My keyword; or click on an existing keyword and then choose a new keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this will be the substituting word of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by drawing it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking and editing keywords in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My sample letter.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, select the picture with the right mouse button and select the Album in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To use keywords to deal with keywords, you first have to put your photos with keywords. this can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword, click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My sample letter; alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the previews of the images and select keywords from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can indicate a photo with any number of tags. the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords related to it. this way you can give a cue for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event in which it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, it will be displayed in the main window under the thumbnail preview.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select from the Tags menu Remove from the menu. the menu only shows you the keywords that have been allocated to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a time-dependent adjustable histogram of the number of images per unit of time. a selection frame can be moved using this histogram. in order to select a time frame, you only have to click the lower rectangle of the selection frame, which displays the time unit.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. this then appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Neon er search box is a small lamp the green will be when the search finds hits. if you click here the filtering is deleted and all images will be displayed again. if the search has not found anything, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, hit the head OK and the search will be done. the text box Save as is used to select a name in my search list to your request. if you want to change your selection after the search, select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select to edit search, the search form will appear again with the previously entered search information. if you select to edit as extended search, the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for searching.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search for in certain fields of & digicam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database. all rules are added by operators, added by operators. an option can be added to this list using the search group / search group. any option can be combined with others via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least....</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes every image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond with each other.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop every image to find a similar result. by means of a swell, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere over the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand colour sketch: draw a quick sketch and a digicam; find the right pictures. also here can be set a treshold.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can click or zoom in or hold it with the mouse wheel. press Ctrl; left mouse button to pull up a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this assumes, of course, that your images contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. it will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digicam; provides a lamp table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add to the light table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opened.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window. a small arrow tells you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you want to synchronize a preview from the toolbar and perform a zoo or move operations on one of the pictures, then you can compare the same area of the two pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly sorting out of a series of pictures. if you are using pairing mode from the toolbar, the two first images are automatically loaded into the fields for the same. use the left mouse button on any preview screen to view it in the left. this simplifies it through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the lighting table, like e.g. F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both preview images in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in panning function that you can recognize on the crossed arrows. to pivot the visible area of the image, you must click on it and hold the & LMB; in the preview mode both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Zoom in the same way as in other views. just use the zoom knob under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the picture and zooming in. this happens in both images if you are the same in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - aside from the fashion statement? digital continuance management considers every part of the process that follows after the picture was taken to the final output and the permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or digital photos saves a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient manner.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect, and use photos again. we focus on the procedure for digital photographers that & digikam; use. we consider downloading, renaming, removing, arranging, securing, evaluating, arranging, archiving, optimizing, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management adopts, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, confectioned and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is, according to your definition, data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you do not even need to find a particular photo without stock management. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then you will definitely not use & digicam;. the approach to save metadata in both a database and image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do is build up information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive, or on a network drive, etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be quickly found on your location. the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date. if you make enough photos, you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; Export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as the versioning of photos, archiving, workflow, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% working files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend to save metadata in the editing page of the metadata in & digicam; this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which ones? to do so, & digicam provides them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are, of course, the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you should now assign any photo keywords, captions and an evaluation. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense, since you can focus on the best photos during further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now use keywords, keywords, as you often name or categories in other programs. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloged images from another source with embedded stitches, then & digikam; automatically set the tree for you or place the images in the right place. re-sorting the tree within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by drawing a sub-tree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata overlap. this is a very crude representation, since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people don't want to let anybody see your photos, they want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after the landing. wow! you start dreaming, having associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you might even hear the silence. so the caption has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title might be more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is it the meaning to transmit to the viewer, to help him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if an image is not perfect, if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text as you want in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8). you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE also provides you with a spell checker.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? wasn't it Earth a boring planet before GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation drives already with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities for exploiting geolocation are already uncountable and will become even deeper in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys by means of pictures with geographic data. & edited; can also export kml files that you can open with GoogleEarth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps Viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and designates the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, i.e. also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digikam; should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and writer): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the photographer's name, e.g. to protect the photographer's identity, then the name of a company or organization may be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: associated with the author. this field contains the photographer's job title. examples of this can be titles as: employee Photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, even though they do not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or change this, embedded in the picture. for individuals, this is only of little interest for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. digicam has to provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives too. in this section, it's about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics on the reasons for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be handled carefully and you may not be trusted more than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold-coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that requires a lifetime of 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliably.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just been written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there's a convenient program called Isobuster that apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual player Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recorder on high-quality media in a non propriate format. then read the data again to check you. likewise, you should copy the media with a description, date & author and then store them on a clean, dark dry and protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discolourers keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this topic: floppy-study</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks hold the longest if you operate in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temperature changes, the error rate increases dramatically. some of SMART's errors are the most common cause of failure.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power issue before you have backed up the files, but these losses can usually be recovered without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices don't matter much, the devices with computer chips and high speed processors are different. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware alteration, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against power peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in bar.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. it guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it offers protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage can use any cable to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage contactors that also include a telephone line for your modem. others offer connection options for coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in an uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. some models allow you to store your data and run down the system. some models also allow you to keep the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and and compare its security with current problems with the cost to avoid these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. at the end you should always remember all cables to recognise before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are localized on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online. the professional version provides you more, in the case of Flickr dramatically more.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are automatically corrected thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory. thus, they are desertification-proof.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram demonstrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the filesystem ZFS and btrfs secure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst part is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred, not if this happened in your hardware. all of these disturbances remain undetected until one day you should open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. no one seems ever thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal filesystems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not currently concerned with transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010, you will see thousands of mistakes each year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates able to deal with plate errors on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will be available for & Linux soon. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebooks and 46% for workstation systems. notebooks already account for 50% of theft.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage, for example theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source filesystems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: untrue, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common filesystems. find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, Theft and Human Mistakes are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical borders. it is also meant that while the technology develops further, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are heading towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is getting worse. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't make anybody responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. so backup your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous, such as re-installing your operating system, the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash will hit you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and thieves are dangerous enough for your data.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, there is a frequent reason for data loss in spite of fuse the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete assurance and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. it creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup was made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come for the backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, IPTC data stored in the image file, retain associate XMP files, retain original memory, scalability, media, re-find images and metadata, copy images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, vision devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So precious pictures survive the next 40 years, that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is being said today with caution and re-evaluate while the time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way to make a certain vigilance. if you have used fewer variants in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: each time you change your computer architecture, memory and security technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux, you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command to see if your new disk was detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sdc & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sdc # change the size of the matchfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task gets easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard the GIF should replace. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC mandates, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, one problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative file format is a royalty-free and open resource format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and obliges to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon even use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource lock quot; technology of the 1990s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored using the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP works because it saves the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking to the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to reach a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera map, you can use this as a temporary fuse.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing you can use external programs. if you edit the images back with & edited, then you should add the metadata again. these have been cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. just export them into web galleries, code into mpeg, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & edited; in the addition of a photo to an album, you can add a description on how to add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digikam; connect them to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. for some cameras this may take a while. if this is the case, the file name and icon will appear on the camera for each file, photos, movies, music, etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before downloading the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The metadata includes the internal metadata, such as exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata page bar from the main window of & digicam; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then the selection of all download. this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in & digicam;. when downloading the photos are not deleted and we advise you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can select only the desired ones with the standard selection methods of & kde. once you have selected the photos, you can download the button Download and then download the selected.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New is available for download. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, you will of course only download the new images.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you use the button all or you want to download the selected albums, a dialogue with which you can select the destination album will appear in which the photos are stored. you can read the list of existing albums in the My Albums section. select the destination album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, hit OK, and the digicam will load the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can all delete at one time by using the Clear All button. if you only want to delete some, you must first select it and then delete the deleted selected.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera. you should therefore carefully check that the photos have been successfully deleted in a digicam, before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera quiver completely, you should do so using the camera menu as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as file names for the photos frequently not particularly meaningful names. the file names are usually reused after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can result in double file names if you upload photos of different shooting galleries to the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time on which the picture was taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission will open three further options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate the data to the author in the standard Autoriidentifier. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix foto-% Y% d% H:% M:% S in the editing field. switch off the option date & time. for further adjustments you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase letters. or in uppercase, if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digicam; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digicam; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during downloading. not all cameras provide this information. in the section Bar Widget metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, the picture is in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken, it can be used to automatically create subalbums in the target album. all images with the same date are uploaded to the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and digitised in this case; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you have to turn on that option. use the Advanced button and select the option Date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog box appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, you ask & digicam; you where the images are to be uploaded. a folder chooser dialog appears for the camera. select the desired folder and press OK to start uploading. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in length and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the data can be determined by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser with a click that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another, user who can locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailings and map references.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save these data in gpx format because this is the only format supported by the geo-based assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of images and from the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other dates then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the accidental co-ordinates created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; tries to give you as much control over its working procedures as possible. there are many settings that the behavior of & digikam. to access these settings, you need to change the settings menu. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or set image editing. so you set the default behavior of & digicam; specify when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields, if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface. also in case of database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for the author's line: this field should include the photographer's job title. these can be names like a photographer, a freelance photographer or an independent, commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be entered here as the picture is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC field. this will ensure that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the & digikam database; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported into & edited; imported without losing any lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image tags as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse pointer rests on a file in the main window. depending on the selected option, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; edited; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">When you open the illuminated table, these settings will be switched on if possible. some images, however, have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. the option & quot; In the whole picture size ladenquot; you should only use on fast computers. if you have one, then you can get better picture results with this.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar when you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling it means that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of luminance than in color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality, since PNG requires a loss-free algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Using the TIFF files option, you can enable the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on the image quality, because the default algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">If you select the loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss free. even if you select the loss-free setting, the relationship between loss of quality and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digicam, image editing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the image processing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default is that all green pixels are the same. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitively to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference causes a minimal loss of details. this option draws the picture a little bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. default is a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top lights, so the parts of your images that are burned out due to the inability of your camera to catch the top lights in the settings. the setting colors trigger some unusual results, as it shows the top lights in various rose tones. finally, you can try to restore some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions out of the yet saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Reconstructing option you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adjusted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the editing box; in order to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the sub-raw data obtained by the color-filtered image sensor, which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">And digicam; and Dcraw provide you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenic-Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. it creates color artefacts at the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color variance of your lentils, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color-softening correction, as it is carried out during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be returned. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information on how to translate colour information from one color space to the other, so that the colours are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when a picture is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder See here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC where you can save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">ICC-Profile settings You have the ability & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to store. everything can be changed when opening the blank file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain any color-mapping or gammakecorrection. at present, dcraw Gamma does not correct conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you must carry out the color-mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof profile with which you can emulate how your image would be given back from one device. this is very useful before you print image, since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may be very saturated. this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expansion makes it possible to identify the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; picture viewer and image processing. by providing this interface can & digikam; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these will be loaded by & digicam; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the previews.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slide show settings should be easy to understand. the upper control adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes turn on or off the metadata that appears at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left a list of all supported cameras. on the right hand side there exists a button automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have a USB- or FireWire-mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it into the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">If you don't, you can set the camera model and port manually. once you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it will be shown in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can paste them all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option dialog for moving &gt; Pictures in the trash Perm, you can adjust the interviewing of & edited; when you delete a photo in an album, you will find more details when you delete a photo and delete an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly used by & digikam; if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without using any questions. otherwise, you will need to save the changes using the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the display of the presentation screen from & digicam; when starting, it may speed up the start-up of & digicam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">Setting When Start after new photos prompts & digikam; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digikam; if something has been deleted from the base folder, asks & digicam; you can delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & digikam; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar settings from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digicam; contains a fast image processing with some base tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview thumbnail and selecting the item View / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them may be used as modules in & digicam; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, see Setting the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, which shows file name, current file number, magnification factor and current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A toolbar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing will change your photos. none of the features will change the original photo before you have used the Save or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the File Replicate button or the button The Restore the Image Processing Restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change you've done on the photo since last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by editing or restoring from the Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to remember.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; using the undo or restore button in the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image, image, or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in and out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or icons in the toolbar or the entries in the click menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you come to the normal view where you use the Esc key. normally, the toolbar is displayed. if you don't want this, you can edit it in the editing dialog of & digicam; view the main window. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the menu and get the standard & kde; Print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select print Assistant from the Album Export menu. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window has a sidebar on the right, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available, without the navigation arrows, also in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab will let the sidebar appear or disappear again.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to the EXIF- and IPTCC fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and is limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated to 2000 characters and special characters are re-formed. if you want to use the IPTC label in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, use either the user button or simply switch to the next image, the lettering will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the application button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database, but you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate several images at the same time, select this and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The valuation is written in the IPTC-field of Regency. the coding follows the scheme in the table below:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keywords tree, and a selection box with the keywords used before; -session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the keyword you entered. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords for a series of pictures. if you have typed different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image will be stored in the keyword field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keywords tree, this will only apply to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, if you want to add a selection with a keyword, please read the section keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyword Filter side bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - date, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more key words are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created words are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and discard keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears which asks you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the wordfilter is based on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. you have been selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword is drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be turned off in settings Varied.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and note that it would have to be one or its, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry you search for in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can, for example, set an Advanced search on all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the grouping button. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / Tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colours that you print or publish from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point in the image processing workflows. the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, you should make sure to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor which is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other educational expenses are by email or the web where sRGB is de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB so works well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and thus have to think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and then click Info and then click Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to add my monitor when I have decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in sRGB colour space or not, you have to screen your monitor because sRGB merges that your monitor is callified by sRGB. if you work as a sRGB colour space, then you either need to add your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve an image in most cases. therefore, use it before trying any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Compare, Automatic Balance and Contrast Expand from the menu Correcise Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the Leustacker values across the entire image, leaving the darkest point black and the brightest spot as bright as possible without changing its shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same: this method adjusts the light intensity factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces just trash. it is a very powerful operation, which either causes miracles in one image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic matching: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and bright border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Enhance Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new-jiustification of all values in between. this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">White balance from & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited as a color space with 8-bit per color is worked. if you can be too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry color white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool's settings.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right, a histogram is shown that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixel very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma. shadow alignment can be improved or dimming down the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then anywhere on the picture preview to use the color chosen for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the Preferences list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result displayed in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load buttons make exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set can save you in a text file and then load again later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button will reset all filter values to their default values and the neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original. if you save it, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image here. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding needs more disk space, computing time and is available only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter Color Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find tone correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time, allowing you to use them for multiple photos at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always need the same error and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation that you will find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The tool color effects provide four colour effects, a solar energy effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that arose when a partially developed print exploded a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photopaper from the additional light. the result was a partial negative of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase eventually creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy effect. the original image is the (1) and that works the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquin; effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a color film that is optimized for daylight by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquin; and hence a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the neon light. for large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and therefore it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos. you can look at the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple LeuchStrength / Contrast / Gamma, the tool toner correction is located to improve exposure. even if dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you will need only the scope of the slider for the purpose described here. concrete the three slides below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected range. under the graph, three slides are clicked into which to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate is to move the knob and watch out how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the settings of the picture. on the left side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it can be set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmical Y axis. for images of a digital camera, linear representation is often the most useful. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pinboards can be used in preview of the original picture to automatically adjust the input of shadows, middle and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. the compression of the output values can, for example, be used to create a light image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: this button automatically sets the image values depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later. for this purpose, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three colour pipette, the input is automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun tones. enable the colour pipette you want to use and click on the original picture to preview the settings of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left side shows half of the original and the target image. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right-hand side:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is mostly the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode produces a wide beam. in this case logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, for example the bright sounds, you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker tones and that the corresponding image pixel gets darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">If you want to shift this selection to the area you want to change, a matching line will be displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. every curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curvy format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When using this method and the three colour pipette buttons, you automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shade, means and sun tones. check the colour pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you get the combined result displayed. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the colour pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digicam; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color hues of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and impact. the left part of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">A preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction permit you to mix these channels. if you enable luminance, the picture will retain the general brightness as well, as the channel mixer is then THE tool to generate great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space. colour space is made up of small noise artefacts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the colour space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Stores as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. you can save any mixer settings for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been re-adjusted. the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is shown in (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since colour pictures can be easily converted on the computer. also with a set of film rolls profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks great, with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure using a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at daytime. similarly, like the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lentil filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">This is very similar to the process of stopping a pressure and the redevelopment in a squamatron. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 ccoin (tm) squiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">"" "" "" "using the" "" "" "" "Tool Making Tool" "" "" "" "; apply decorative textures to a picture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a Pop Art portrait of enlarged points or as a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect is applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to see. the relief model has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digikam; add tool frames can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a possibility to retain his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture. throughout the picture with a coloured line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white pictures), shkantet surrounds it with a nice three-dimensional frame.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: width of frame in percent. the width of the frame is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target picture decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio cut beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple one formatted text into an image at any position. this can also be done at several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with the mouse. use text orientation, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. the bigger the image, the bigger the character set must be. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." after the image has been saved once, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digikam; tool template apply you can place a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The image template apply in image processing can be used to lay templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions concerning size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to decrease the file size of the template. if you want to add your template from the digicam; Mailinglist digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you will need to set up your template folder with the button "Folder Folder." select the folder in which you copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder automatically updates the template toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="474">There are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button reduces the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image lying under the template. to do so, take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpen is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but it produces grainy images, especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Sharper mask operates on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it sharpens no little bit, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapor and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitalized images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process has to combine colors with only minimal differences to one color point. this in turn causes sharp edges to blur a bit. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more after sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">Images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners are already using an image filter while reading the image. if you disable it, you will get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening value. this allows you to use the menu entry Correct sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, you should carefully handle this because the results do not work very naturally: the sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image is refocusing the tool.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little bit softly is much easier than sharpening it. use the tool to adjust the soft sign with the menu entry Correct soft draw and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount amplifies the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, rustle and impression of grates will produce near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold is a fracture from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference-amount. thus, one can define a minimal difference with it for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpen and therefore flaw errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred mask. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). unsharp mask has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted filtering algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool attempts to sharpen an image & quot; refocusquot; in which it reverses the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocussing achieves mostly better results than blurred.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's fold has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixies which are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Viennese Inverse of the Gauß 'fold is actually very strongly influenced by far away pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should be 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1, and eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce artefacts. the filter can accept values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, and eg; 0, the image quality is very bad. a good value is 0,03.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss'sche Focus: this is the radius for the palate. use this if your blur is Gauß 'sch. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the palate. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any more focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections in the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress pictures, & eg; than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">In general, blurring produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by arming masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter. practically, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur mask.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original blurred colour has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpness correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothing slider sets the blurring of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The tinted ink allows a modified colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The Image error correction tool is one of the most widely developed tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool has various presets as starting points to make the restoration easier. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the picture.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction-dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes out evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD hiss is a high value undulating pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing ratio over all. p then defines the relative smoothing.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going to go through. normally, here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle magnification [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride width [0,1, 10]: integrated step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal, but it doubles the runtime. therefore, we recommend it to let it expire.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load buttons make exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long time and drag a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the abort button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected with little artefacts. the module is applied on a photo taken in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a unique black artefact in the background that caused by a bad film shift during the journey. the original picture is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">Noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">Below you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius checks the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can blur the image.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch in front of the filter to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, you may need to adjust the edge filter again if you change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubricating occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: check edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the total noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak hiss or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend that you change color or luminance in order to improve the image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process, which is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend that you change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically stronger, but also lubricates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter damping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering range responds to variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother if it is too high. it can remove noise and phase jitter at the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for that purpose. all parameters for reducing noise, which you have set, can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little bit softly is fortunately much easier than sharpening a picture. use this tool to soften the soft sign with the menu entry Correct soft draw and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">Digicam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; artifacts & quot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save as and Load buttons make exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long time and drag a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera onto an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures are applied to an old color photo, which was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by scannerlights and photo paper. the original image is shown in (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">It uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixelquot; and "quot; light pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image subtracting method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the darkshot button. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the right image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard remembers the last dark image and will automatically load it back in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview can help you correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Cut: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the faulty pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotspot correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was magnified to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digicam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially in the medium and large photo format, often cannot illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) it reduces the corners and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 with aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to use the camera by hand. wide-angle lenses should also use an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as there are otherwise non-sharper effects caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's filtration and colour or grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation with a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further exposures of the destination image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity loss at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or by chance of a luminous intensity of 2, reducing it to compensate for a smaller degree of vignetting.</seg>
<seg id="572">LeuchStrength, Contrast, and Gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction decreases the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the exposure of the target image, let the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to an image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortion can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric aberration of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of gravity adjusts the distant edges to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be eliminated virtually.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the distortion strength of the second degree. negative values can be used to correct tone-shaped distortions and cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of distortion. this value appears stronger at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resumes the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The sound and cushion distortion should be performed before all cutting or size changes. it is best to perform this correction first. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a barrel-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent to the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line. move the cursor in the image preview to view the dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Transformers cropping from image processing or using the zoom slider of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as pictures from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown in (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org web site which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters of film baskets and film sensitivity (ISO). if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film, the ISO control changes the amount of the film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green lawns become white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce infra-red film, especially the green channel it makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos since the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filtrate applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is shown in (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a type of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">This is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere released from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, road-photographic, granular view especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to check the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, adjusted to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the movie effect effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digikam; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the top selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the processing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage quiz. the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized. pictures whose gradient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator elects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; Filter Gravure shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses an copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digicam; Filter Gravure is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in images with a simple structure, where color is not the most important thing about the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows adjusting the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distortions. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image into cells and makes it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the shaft blocks 1, the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Disharper: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from one center point. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurred: blurring the image by turning the pixels at a center point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Blurr: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurred vision: blurred the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blur of a linear moving, z: B: photograph taken from a car or train.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shaking blurr: blurring the image by random shifting of the pixels and thus simulating the blurring of an involuntarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">"" "" "" "intelligent" "" "" "" "sharpness:" "" "" "" "finds the colour tank in the picture and wipes it out without the rest." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture. this gives it a wet appearance to your pictures. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digicam; image processing to keep an area free from raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that is free to stay. if you start the filter Regentropfen afterwards, the area will remain free from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed image (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it in the correct orientation by mirroring or turning. you can find the tools in the menu Transformers Rotate or Transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you zoom a picture and keep the details hot? how can you zoom into a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached? how can you invent or guess the missing information? the Cimg algorithm that is used here makes a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose change size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Changing the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approach the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo resolution was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the new size is retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each template for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very quick with what it does, but it can take a very long time and drag a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo inflating by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. image editing allows you to create a picture with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pulling the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut out. this will give you a good overview how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by simply drag by the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The Ctrl button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is trimmed (Ctrl; + X). use the File Save or File Save As in the File menu to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">Depending on the aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as a high-format or landscape format. in portrait format, the larger value of the height and the cross-format width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are centimeter, inch or any other physical size. you can see, for example, a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can set the range for cutting to the maximum possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After aspect ratio will save its settings depending on the orientation orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the translation help enable you to hide help so that you can better summarize your images. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division that relies on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more liquid help lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye drops into the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not a triangular triangles.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal options mirror and mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the Color button you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can become invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it's easy that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can fix this with the digicam; image processing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are set in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to crop the image is the Automatically cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after rotation. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a point of reference to the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is slightly lubricated. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformer trimming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shearing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal shear, for example, will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not a rotation, the picture is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Drag your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can rotate horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed to the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, like the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shearing tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">For a single shear, this effect is usually negligible, but two formulations produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After sheathing the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transformers cropping from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible at this point to give a list of all the file formats available on their system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">This is done using the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre-defined list. if the extension is specified in the list, the file will be displayed in the editing pane. you can change this list of file extensions, and edit it. in the Configuration section you will find more information on this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select even the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression processes on digital images. redundant information is reduced to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also store lossless if this is indicated in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the shell format you can read from Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam; in the Configuration section you will find more information on using modules with & digikam;.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need to make your photo editing are in & digikam; their description follows here.</seg>
<seg id="701">Use a unified dialogbox showing the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you will see & quot; texture appquot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image. on the left of it allows five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">The left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontal parts without duplicates. the upper area shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area.</seg>

<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The properties tab shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo properties: shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo. these data come from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can click or zoom in or hold it with the mouse wheel. press Ctrl; left mouse button to pull up a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this assumes, of course, that your images contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for palettes. the application can be used to manipulate color palettes and to select and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The palettes that are installed by & kde can either be applied to the whole system or just one user. in the latter case, they are in your Personal Folder for & Desktop; -Settings and hot User-defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the dialog box, you can select from a list of installed pallets, or browse the folders for files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed in the palette view as a line. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">The color is described below the palette view. here the colour name can also be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">To create such a selection, click the area next to a color to move the cursor to it. then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the check box Beim Cursor is enabled under the Color button, the color from the color panel is inserted at the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwrites another; depending on whether the mode overwriting was selected. this mode can be set by selecting the check box overwriting under the cursor.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy, Cut and Paste.</seg>
<seg id="722">& kcoloredit; uses the following format for data in the clipboard: for each color three values for the proportions of red, green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line character, if another color follows. if there are three figures in the clipboard, they can be inserted as a color in & kcoloredit.</seg>
<seg id="723">The colors in the palette and the output of the color selector can be dragged with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="725">Graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. until now, there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that include & graphiviz; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphiviewer; project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the features of a well-integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphiviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphiviewer; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well-integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI;</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & kate; the graph will be recalculated and displayed in & kgraphiviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; or to open the graph in & kgraphiviewer; in a & kate; -component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading big graphs (currently there are problems starting at around 1000 knots and a hack for representing more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required software: & kgraphiviewer; is an & kde; program which presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for displaying the graphs. in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. at first, when you start & kgraphiviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar only contains the icon file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot; files, the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special buttons, left and right with pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming in both directions is limited by the factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the uploaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be shown:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph will be reloaded or if you want to ignore the change. & kgraphiviewer; can also memorize your decision, so that later on. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Preferences...</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a Graphite file outside a current & kgraphiviewer; instance, in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kgraphiviewer; instance, or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub-window of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but can also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start, you can reopen all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice as well as change later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">When you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be fit into this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph which is distributed across several pages without header and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewable Download page gives the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been altered on the hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or omit the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The page opening gives the ability to specify the behaviour of & kgraphiviewer; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session. you can specify a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that each time it is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the ability to specify the start-up behavior of & kgraphically. you can set a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session) or decide to be asked at each start.</seg>

<seg id="750">The algorithm puts the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible as possible edge overlapping.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the default for non-generated graphs. it produces representations according to the jumping spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a springform model for non-generated graphs. it uses the Fructman Reingold Heuristics, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the node in a circular form according to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog in which you can specify a layout command, then executed by a shell. the command should accept the Graphite file as a parameter, and specify the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format.</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module can read images and provide tools to read new images and save them.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan pictures: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner by the SANE project or another source such as Video Streams. to make this work you need to have Kooka and SANE installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu item pictures, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to get the picture. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears in that you can replace the default ducrhe custom to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the Scan button to read the image.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed, as some settings might not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After pressing the Scan button you have to wait for the scan to complete and specify the type of image file. remember that type BMP does not compress and hence creates very large files. you must also select the folder and # 160; select or create it by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screenshots can be created after you have selected the "Import" &gt; Screen Saver menu. a window appears in which you can set various screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select The complete Desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all of your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workstation.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other workspaces, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After creating the screen shot, the dialog box appears with the options of the target image with the options already described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. Flickr makes it possible to send photos to the people that are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, place the photos of your camera's phone online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The module Export to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you will be guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. so it is your identification to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to the Flickr website. you will be presented the following page after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Just close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing YES, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr is started for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which will show the current access permissions that the module will show. currently, the module does not support any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. pressing the Ok button starts uploading the photos to Flickr Server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the picture as tags during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the Public, Friends and Famillia options, you can set the access rights to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose to change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos before uploading will be changed in size. size is taken from the value registered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI geographical localization module allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographical data is stored in the EXIF data of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI geographical localization module provides tools for locating images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx-format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographic localization correlation. this interface can summarize a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want correlate to the main window and go to the menu. the dialog at the top will then appear. to make a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with a GPX file.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation takes place which shows the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done using the time zone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have the right data. if you know that in reality there is a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then push the button correlated to the interpolating.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog reveals the coordinates of a call to the next you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set by the displayed card. select the region and increase sie.Add this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module Picture Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages conform to version 4.01. you can select the albums as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all the albums which are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right hand side you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the range below, the Albenpreview and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tabs appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is extensively descriptive. if you click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; KuickShow,</seg>
<seg id="825">The Album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLexport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images is also stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth, which of course also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnail tab allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album Rider for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the generation. the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and shortcuts. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below, without the usual losses of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the color information takes place. this can also be found in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client is a tool that lets you connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Respect: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the picture you want to copy in the main program and then click the Import function. this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but do not write in any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please take a look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images into an MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images into an MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show. afterwards, you can create the module via extras MPEG slide show.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting of the pictures or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you're satisfied with your list, you should customize the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value produces very sudden, a high, on the other hand very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should let them black. you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file. keep the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes, you can go to the creation of the movie with the button coding.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that the encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the MjpegTools and ImageMagick programs on the right bottom of the button settings.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing gimbp. this is for example: useful to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file that is to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the button Preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you're satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to edit your images frequently or otherwise use it elsewhere, you should not choose the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start conversion using the Execute button. if you want to break this process again, you can use it to cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing files automatically. this is helpful in case they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the number and the timestamp.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can make the image smaller or bigger.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportionally (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportionally (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Prepress: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the picture window will be displayed with the images you have selected. you can add more images using a button selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag pictures to the picture list and drop them there to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">The pictures will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After selecting all the images you can open the New message window of your e-mail client with the OK button. you only have to add the addresses and the subject.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not make sure to send too many images at a time. most email accounts have limitations on the size of emails to be sent. it may be a good idea to send mails if you want to send a lot of images.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used again each time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email client from the menu. if you choose Thunderbird, you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and added to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format below the image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in images file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages, in search of errors. however, your email program will automatically start at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window appears with questions like you want to show your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL passes in the presentation activates very elegant picture transitions by OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option file name indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop. afterwards, you can manually intercept it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select make sure that the pictures are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the pictures can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly select another effect at each transition between images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left corner of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to switch you on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not currently have any documentation. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Respect: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected submenu option, as a background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your images and videos with comments, you can use & kphotoalbum; browse through them, see picture. as you can see by comparing them with the picture, entries are now available in each group, i.e. in people, places and in the group keyword.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories for which you entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse to the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">When you select another person, only the pictures shown on which both can be seen. through this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, locations and other settings, you can use thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same icon in front of her name. you can use & kphotoalbum; however, for each person to save your own preview image, that also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display images next to the names, select the button located on the toolbar on the right. in the pop-up menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display icons with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you do not have suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must specify which image to be displayed for each individual. in order to do so, you will need to open the image editor window (in closer detail) and view the entry category editor in the context menu. in the click window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you view the Search entry in the main window, a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog at once.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the label lettering or description, the descriptions or descriptions of the pictures are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all images by certain names as you can see in the picture. here you will find pictures depicting Jesus, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum; if you do not like to read manuals but want to try similar features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and select the demo in the first dialog, in case you start & kphotoalbum; start for the first time, or select in the menu help the menu entry kPhotoalbum; -Demo. after that, some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of & kphotoalbum; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the website of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document for downloading.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar displays you date statistics on the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed items preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first picture of this date is displayed in the preview display) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, only pictures of this time period will be displayed to you in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a log of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you with two ways to create HTML websites with your images. one is available in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other is available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual the in & kphotoalbum is described; integrated version, which you can create through the menu file HTML....</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each section is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on kPhotoalbum; HTML-example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether you want to create a & kPhotoalbum; export file should be created on the overview page. you'll find more information about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without a description. note that all images are exported from one party.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clear, which is why this is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set up various resolutions for the images. you need to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more images that have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified. so it can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transfer time. if it wants to get an image larger, it changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">For all of your HTML files, select a base folder and add a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time. this allows you to select the location for all future pictures. here you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages were created should be started. otherwise, the web browser will be in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you must manually copy them to it. to enable the import function, see, correct, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings just described have changed all three to base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you set in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you might want to create your pictures with them. however, if you have already spent a lot of time applying the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to go with & kphotoalbum; this work does not go once more.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external ones. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file, or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you can have all the images together and pass them on independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kin file directly from the Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file scans the images in two ways. first, it searches through the images that are located in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you entered when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML-export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can view from the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you copy the manual to the .kim file, you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copying Automatically to the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images are already compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option on this page is maximum image size limit. if you send images to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size, since the .kin file would otherwise be very large.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Importing..., it will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The importing assistant is made up of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalise the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is named in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they correspond in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view pictures: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will pass through the various steps of (1) Specifying information about your images, through (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced subjects and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual you talk about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the top folder of its images. this is a simple XML file that you can back up with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notes the folder where your images are stored and automatically re-uses them in future starts. if you want to read another folder with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu item "Settings kphotoalbum" you can set up... get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum. in the following section of the user manual, you will learn the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left, you will see six different symbols with which you can view settings of preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, there is a detailed help available, which you can view by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the option you want.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can set different properties for each picture, e.g. people, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog, which is used to edit already existing groups. for each existing group, you can select an inscription and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialog box options, you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group are set up once in a group instead of all groups of a group as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list box you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window you will find a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kPhotoalbum; splits its modular system with other graphics applications, such as digicam and gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can and are not described in this manual, since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page, which you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Because the modules of several applications are shared among each other, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures The & kPhotoAlbum; Demo Database, you can either use the command line with the command &gt; kPhotoAlbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, whereby it may be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications put their images into albums. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates the order for some modules so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">It simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is simply the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album & kphotoalbum, the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here we go and kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you are using the category people, you will get & kphotoalbum; so do, so if you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you see an example of a start screen as soon as you get & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar you will see the window with which you have entered your image database. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the entry pictures to show you an overview of all the pictures available.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to add any picture with annotations. this includes information about the people who are shown on the picture, where the picture was taken, etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text box by setting people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum, because you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons, you can, therefore, that the names used are moved up to find and assign the persons faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the Sorting icon on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each picture individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with annotations. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons, which are below the thumbnail of the picture on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded multiple images, e.g. with the same person, it can be more convenient to select all these images and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the US. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you see a browser window showing the USA as an overboard. in order to show you that this is an overboard, a special icon will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry into a category and take it there to sort it into a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the frames that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button... which offers, among other things, the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide the window. you will see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry pictures in the browser, you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images, or of all images if you have not set a filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, this will appear in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and either click the Delete key or select Delete from the Edit menu. now you will see the window you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use & kphotoalbum; you can also use pictures without having stored them on your hard disk. of course you need to have the images stored somewhere, so that & kphotoalbum; you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures depicting the right upper corner are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, the preview images are available so that you can preview them. however, you can not preview them with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and then copy them back to them. so if you want to avoid problems such as merging your images, please buy a larger hard drive to save all images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the pictures menu you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures in such a way that at the end of the ones you would like to make available to others and click on Actual View in the privacy menu. alternatively, you can also click all images that your little sister can see, and unlock the menu item All out of the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have set which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case. if you now give your laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry pictures, so that all images you have locked will be hidden.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, anyone who can access the index.xml file can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection only serves to deny the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you all of your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them at some point. for this reason it has a photo _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. of course he shows the picture, but additional all the information you have entered through the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it elsewhere. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is to be displayed at all. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have several images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the keys image high and image. you can jump to the first and last picture with pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl; S button.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; is to be able to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer, you can click into the image and zoom out. for the zoom-zooming, you can pull out a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus button you can zoom out again The Plus button zooms in the center of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. using the control key sets the zoom, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zooming operations that work for videos that are in and out are the plus and sub-key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the script functions from the context menu, you can turn the picture. this does not work with videos. you can make comments on the current image using the menu item Remarks from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can view this and open configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to select the image and view more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while you look one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to add pictures with features while watching them. features are the letters A to Z and you can place a feature by clicking the corresponding letter. in this you see a picture where the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set attributes to your pictures, they are available in the browser. you can see this in your browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do right now.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you can view categories in dre preview view then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected.</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you can copy & kphotoalbum; paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image but in the database. in this way, you can reverse your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In you can see a picture on which it was painted. to turn on the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; on the picture, select on the picture from the context menu. to stop the painting, just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovray; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully rule, but the documentation to & Povray; you should have read and understood the documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree, you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model Views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed to allow you to select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene before.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take over those changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with error description. then you can correct the input errors and click on user or reject the changes with abrupt.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already includes the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button to change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the checkpoints disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the Visibility level of the parent object or as an absolute value. objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their Visibility stage is smaller or equal to the Visibility level chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or under one view, drag the Anfasser to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the Anfasser to the right or left of one view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to map multiple views on top of each other, drag the Anfasser in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the flashcard riders at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to view a view from anchoring, drag the Anfasser to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the pane bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the connector bar. to prevent closing, click the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any position.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view allows you to save window order... save. it will display a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual is written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Rendering icon Rendering the Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the menu item View Scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview up to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icons settings icon in the toolbar or select Render Modi in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Every render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but meaningful is a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the subsection and enter the picture cut to the rendering in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the quality combination you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render characteristics can be found in the user manual of & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to lessen the influence of these errors. generally, images with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on anti-aliasing, compute and connect & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptively because the super-sampling comprises the neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptive; recursive because each pixel depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method POV-Ray follows a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the colour values exceeds the specified threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are further pursued and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called jittering. if you turn on jittering, change & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; it calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams do not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly quit, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the menu entry file Import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete command range of & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source text in & kpovmodeler; import this code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for & Povray; this will add the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert Source for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">When you click on help in the property view, the & Povray; the & Povray; User Documentation for the displayed object. set the path to your retention and the version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for viewing the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used to display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window-type license plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object scope of the points to the grid in the contextual menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects, such as the sphere, you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you tick the high level of detail for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections. this feature gives a better approximation for the projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you tick the wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is displayed in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used to render the scenes. you can adjust the values for depth and treshold in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window assignments or create new window assignments. in the pane orders section, it explains how to create and store window assignments.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down selector standard window arrangement: displays all existing window assignments. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window assignments shows all existing window assignments. a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all the views for the selected window order. new views can be created with the Add button and select selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With new column, create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with Unten anchor the window under the existing window, with card map you get a map-card view together with the previous view and suspended the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only receive a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, there can be no rules for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene lies in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons. read the documentation so that you can get an idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this tutorial, you first have to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select Edit Delete. now you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you will notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of rendering the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the naming camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera. simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the user button or the input key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, you can see the scene from the camera's point of view here.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you could, for example, insert a header (insert final body jader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that is a cumbersome method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite level as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the button Apply or the input key. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the level, although at the moment only as a finite level. when you render the scene, the plane extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree carefully, you will find that you can fold the item for the bottom when you click on the + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the standard options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting. choose one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should shift the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but select something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens, where you can choose how to insert the object. please select first object. the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = ground pigment), with a click on the preview button you will see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment will show only a matt black material, because you still have to enter settings for the pigment. therefore always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the header and the ball in the preview, just click on the user button and then click the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should receive the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this item twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, choose monochrome each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should already be done easily, since you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the input key or the button Apply), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the sphere would float above the ground as you have moved the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering is a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the floor, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first object and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on ball pigment, then select Incolors and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effect and reflection gives already some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromium-plated surfaces even when metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of the possibilities offered to you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that render the scenes) through each pixel in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you also don't see anything, the image is simply black. obviously any scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file you have created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last undo command. you can select this menu item only if you have used the edit item.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting up & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option to add preset short commands to & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set toolbars. with this option you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface separately, without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these base bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel-based, using an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can indicate by clicking the & LMBn, or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image is to be displayed in its own window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching filename is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Enter or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog Insert - & kuickShow; there are five flashcards. in three of them, general and editing and slide show, you can set the way of the & kuickshow; in the two other short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, the key shortcuts can be specified for each window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images are opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color you can adjust further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>

<seg id="1181">Below you will find a list of these shortcuts and their function. the global key shortcuts can be set up by right-clicking in the player window and setting up global shortcuts. you can set up the & Amarok; -specific key shortcuts by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set short commands... select.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You can set up existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they function as & Amarok; short commands. this will make your keyboard the & Amarok; control centre.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many common functions, which are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browsers, players, playlists, playlists browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some of its own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback when the script can't be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are available and use a dialogue to show the user why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' rescue LoadError: 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} 'exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command; each KDE installation should be included.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. for this purpose, the function exec () is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. for this purpose scripts are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script may also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange indicates that a new piece is being played. the script could now ask for more information about the new piece (for example, the metadata or the piece length) with DCOP functions.</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu entry can be selected. to add an entry to the menu, you can use dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle) to remove an entry.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to, for example, save data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks's script administration can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the acquisition of amarocscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file's rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can attach it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & crde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok, you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. you might even search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">You may have some playlists, but can never decide which ones you want to hear? then the playlists browser is right for you. and if the decision is still difficult, select the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. furthermore, many different audio systems can be used, so YOU can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right way to experience your music anew!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake are used if you don't have any problems when compiling. if you encounter problems, please tell them in the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options to enable or disable at compile time with the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compile options, certain dependencies must be met so that they can be used. see the system requirements section for details.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activate debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help with the development of & Amarok, you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; can be set up without trouble using the setup dialog. the setup dialog has several flashcards to set up the various functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">In addition, when the option is turned off, only the playlist window will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Use mood barometer: this function is only available if & Amarok; compiled with support for moodwin.This option switches the experimental function of the mood barometer.</seg>

<seg id="1214">External browser: lets you choose which browser from & Amarok; started when a browser is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Using other browsers: you can specify the path to another browser, which is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save playlists when you exit, save the current playlist automatically when you exit and Amarok;. enable this option if you don't want to lose the running playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually saved playlists: when activating this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep the current piece visible when changing the piece, so that the playlists window is rolled up / unrolled to keep the running piece always in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Switching to context-browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can adjust & Amarok's appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok. by selecting Custom fonts, the otherwise gray described section is enabled. you can select scripts for the following area: playlists windows, player windows and context browsers. click Select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the selection user defined color scheme, you have the choice of choice and can set up your own color scheme. for this purpose, use the color selector for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Continue playback at the start, cause & Amarok; after program start, resume play automatically with the piece at the spot with which it was stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The subwindow on-screen display allows you to turn on the OSD. if on-screen display is attached, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog box the desired font for the OSD. the shadow box shadow causes the text to be shadowed in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Use your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the OSD colors for writing and background. a click on the colour spaces opens the dialog to the color selection. if own colors are not enabled, the preset & kde; colors are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field represents the text displayed in the OSD. by entering the placeholders the OSD can be adjusted to your needs. below you will find a list of available space mounts and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users, so you can specify which screen of a multi-monitor environment to appear on the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The flashcard audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers also activate more settings in this card card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, the & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse the subfolder recursively: this causes & Amarok; both the selected and their subfolders to be searched by music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allows & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders for changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: cause & Amarok; Add all found playlists to your collection folder (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlists browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination pad driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup is needed in the MySql setup window.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; on calculator: will enter the machine on which the MySql database is located. then, under port: the network port is entered, under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data needed for the connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The debit card last.fm aligns the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Enter your user name and password for your Last.fm profile. if you do not have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and thus update the profile: this setting allows it & Amarok; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Invoke similar interpreters: after activating this setting, & Amarok; a list with similar interpreters can be retrieved to the played piece. you can view the list in the context browser. note: you do not need last.fm profile to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included in it, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD assumes that your window manager considers the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will, for example, cause difficulties. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org and also attach the broken file causing the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time, it is because Taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this bug to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries with the same compiler version have been compiled. if, for example, & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable automatic off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least use no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens in case of a crash). if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in Meta-Info, but do not label them as Unicode. the following perl script resolves the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s symbols in the status bar (shuffle mode / repetition / dynamic playlist) always look active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a well known bug in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects will be easily forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then check if Amarok is using the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd'which amarocapp '_ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or modify / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok finds the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are several possibilities. most installation problems are easiest through the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and IRC under irc.freencap.net in the # Amarok channel.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help. please insert only one error if you have something to fix an error in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok, only an empty playlist appears. how do music pieces fit in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the user interface intuitive, the startup subwindow has been converted to the statistics window. you will find it in Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces, the rating column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the list of the playlist and select column. click anywhere in the new rating column to specify the rating for a piece. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove and then press def on your keyboard. or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select Von playlist from the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and drop it there, just like you would do it with other files. it's as simple as that: -)</seg>

<seg id="1269">No. yes, that's true! no! & Amarok; uses a backend independent approach, so the actual question is: Which media types supports GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEM?. as you can see, we support pretty much any imaginable audio format. GStreamer can even decode text and PNG!</seg>
<seg id="1270">It may! you may use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, which does not include any MP3 decoder in default (due to patent reasons). the solution: alt-F2, gg: RedHat d.mp3, input key</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you are using the Streamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a blender. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixers (e.g. SBlive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause and solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify a different link (e.g. sink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">You can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you would only hear a white noise. GStreamer reads the file, decodes them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open control center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound servers with the highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!).</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEmultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed play. read this error report. the magnification of the sound buffer in your ALSA installation file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either do not use the Arts Driver, but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE-Multimedia completely to get the faster arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Use another driver (the xine driver has been strongly optimized for Analyzer), or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffer, the less dreamers react the visualizations. yes, this is a mistake, please help us fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, it crashes and Amarok. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After the installation of GStreamer, you have to register all the components. follow-register to register all the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help you can also ask the IRC Channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (finish Amarok before!): - Download and install ffmpeg, compile and install it. then run all of the ffmpeg files in the GStreamer module folder (you will find the module folder with follow-config / GStreamer-config) and run it again. start now & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1331">& Amarok; requires installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. also, some additional packages are listed that make working with & Amarok; make it more pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages using a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player, also has & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to everyone else. the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and search your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok can be used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; Control Center. at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current track or current stream. directly below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and sample rate of the current play. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining time of the play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the running text display. you can change by the available Analyzer by right clicking on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; -Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current Analyzer will be displayed in an independent, enlarged window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also included in the running text display. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used for setting equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the slider to set the play position or volume. with the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The built-in Equalizer is simple and works with all audio operators. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you activate the Equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. however, don't be deterred by the abundance of features, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">In the navigation area, you can find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right hand side is the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use, yet even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context-browser displays different information about the current play. its look can be adapted with the help of context-browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and artist. these three subwindows are later explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you may notice that the subwindow is discarded. the information displayed there is now distributed in other parts of & Amarok; in addition, the information can be collected in the statistics window (extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title you will find the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to look up the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Below the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover pictures in the context-browser, the cover pictures must be in the same folder as the current piece. file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png files may have arbitrary names, but pictures with the word front in the name are treated preferentially. the context browser will also show cover images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended Pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the Recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist. this area shows the five most rated pieces of the current artist.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to be displayed in the music subwindow. with the right mouse button, click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last part, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately. you can also right-click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, & Amarok tries to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - only groups the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Artist / Album - Until the pieces are arranged according to the artist and among them a further split after the respective album is performed. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Group Interpret / Year - Album - Sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping album - All albums of your collection will be alphabetically sorted among each other and the artist will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / artist - your pieces are first sorted by genre, including by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above but is additionally sorted by album under the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can adjust and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically collect your collection as soon as you change something on the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">There is a search filter directly below the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter is a drop-down selector with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection. you can choose from different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">Clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser will give you the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This clears the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach the playlist - Adds the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry, you will achieve the same effect.</seg>

<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for the transfer to the media player. for more details, see the section on the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">All pieces of this artist burn / Burn on CD - This will send the selected pieces to K3b and burned either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Move files to the bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the selected album as a compilation, causing it to appear under various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Set up selection - Changing a compilation selected album back to a normal album. after that, the album will no longer be displayed under various interpreters but again under the associated interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes it easy to handle a lot of playlists. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The bottom part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for running time. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection, which have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created Intelligent Playlists are possible. click Intelligent Playlist to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow Media Player is used for connection with & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. when & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist, sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the Artist list. when you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser, there is an address bar with which you can pick music from an input URL. for example, when you type: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz, you can access music in the file musi.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the hanging of files can be difficult by simply dropping the Shift key. in that case, holding the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place. as soon as you enter characters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button for a long time until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter by spaces separate search terms, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one or two, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR between the search terms OR, search for entries containing either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then wrap the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will be searched for entries that contain Mike Oldfield, but not by entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also look for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -some search for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">For example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 comment: bad. this is looking for all the pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bad.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can select the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then right-click in the desired sequence on the entries. the entries then get a labeling with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left side you will find the Add that you can add to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will revert and restore them, so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1399">The last button on the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that which you will see in the player window over the right mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for the toolbar, for example, renal controls and volume control. you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist. it displays the title of the current play, the number of pieces and the overall playing time of all pieces. in addition, the status for relapsing mode and retrieval can be easily changed by double clicking with the mouse in the appropriate display area.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1404">One click on this entry will open the window visualisation plugins. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry is a submenu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can launch it by selecting covers cover administration in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover administration contains a list view of all the albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left side.</seg>

<seg id="1409">The queue management received your large collection in & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece to the queue, the playlist will display a number next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 will be played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1479">The headline is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the headline has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the commands available in the top part, you can adjust the key mapping to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you need to enter the password for the system administrator (root) when the wizard is started.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the Settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work immediately. this dialog is meant to personalize and for fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled, for example, via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">In order to use the DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program, or use the more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and type of task are more important in addition to which of the accompanying programs you give.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume you are using the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; started. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions common to all & kde; program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatDVDs and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createMedia CDProject () DCOPRef createMedia CDProject () DCOPRef createMedia CDProject () DCOPRef createMedia CDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () void duplicated () void burnCdImage () void burndvdImage (KURL url) void burndvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can get a project on the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then get a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void addurl (QString Name) void addUrl (KURL url, QString) void addurls (QString path) void renameItem (QString path) void setmonthly id (QString path) void setVolumeID (QString))</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then adds files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createMedia CDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT addresl / home / truer / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudio creator; is an audio CD; -reader for & kde;. with it can easily be read Audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudio creator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoders who code these WAV files (compressed). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (loss-free compression) are supported by default (these encoder packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution). other encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read out and stored in wav files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into MP3 or OGG format, or also in other formats such as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudio creator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all of these programs are usually available for any Linux distributions, so it is probably not necessary to install something yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format should be used? chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about encoder, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CDs; s: as already said, uses & kaudio creator; cdparanoia to read the audio data from the CD; this program is not intended to avoid any copy protection. if not the firmware of the CD; / DVD device protection, it is not possible to avoid a protected audio CD; just avoid buying copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be called as often until a suitable configuration has been found), it will be explained later by the daily handling of reading a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface, which you often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without a network, where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. step by step, for example, you can find more information about how this program is being used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the master tabs for configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">CDDB request starts with CD data in accordance with the set up of request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder has been configured in the code settings tab in the setup directory - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the standard. it must be noted that previously the encoder has been configured in the code settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Open the file manager, so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Open the setup dialog for the type of notification (such as logs, beep) for program events (such as reading the & CD; terminates).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the Main Configuration dialog of & kaudiocreator; with different card cards (like encoders, to set up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such 'offshore' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bit rate the differences are less important because both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is nevertheless supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high audio quality (at high bit rates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices exists.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset Standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 36.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression ratio about 5.5. requires ever 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate app. 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of youngsters, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that manually entered or fetched through the program automatically from the freedb via the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / used with & kaudio creator; and the coding program to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the key words (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudio creator must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudio creator; parameters that can be used (= button code in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what freedb is: a free database where individuals can read / enter the audio CDs, so all the others can download this information instead of entering the computer itself. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent that from the & CD; information that is publicly available on the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music business can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudio creator; actively select a check box (sending one address). for the use of freedb may be used with another (bogus) address as the one used in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving data from the server (this can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudio creator; set up for use of freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (generally issued monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which readout program is used to store pieces from the CD; in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined encoders. more information about encoders are in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, further information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reading requirements and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this will not work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords.</seg>
<seg id="1545">You should already have cdparanoia and lame installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can, for example, be found with a search engine since it is considered as a non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure the directory is / usr / share / cd and that you own write rights on it (eg by trying to copy something into it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setting up of & kaudio creator; something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each read & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to be used to compression the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them at any reading of a & CD; change if the appropriate settings are found once.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reader program so that it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, the effective device name can also be specified. if the drive can be accessed with other programs, it will help you to view the / etc / fstab file and / or DVD drives available there.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map map General Settings. here there is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is left / entered as shown in the screen shot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information, please select, so that you will be informed when information about creating a keyword (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and leave the & CD; data can be downloaded automatically via the Internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the freedb server while reading the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; record found, immediately start reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries, they can be easily changed. the directory or filename is changed with konqueror &gt; renaming and the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. to use freedb in offline mode, the two selections must be selected, at least the first. mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the freedb section.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB Server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this path, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as regards the server, but as many firewalls buck the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to send data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take over the settings from the screen shot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously missing pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; throw out after reading the last piece: tick this to throw the CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must specify the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored. if the field is not selected, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Typing everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a little long, under certain circumstances, something needs to be flatten to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted when needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of subsequent changes of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous to encoding WAV files: with a dual-core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine, you can try to code more than one wav file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudio creator; this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a & CD; if you have selected the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; running to the hard disk. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described in the previous section and set up. first, a connection to the internet is built, since we are comfortable and the & CD; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read & CD; repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; which is not yet included in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from the data obtained for a CD; with success from freedb fetched data. therefore, you will learn to enter the & CD data manually instead of retrieving it from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example will be found. it's a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet been done, then the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the screen shot. this only if the & CD; can be identified as an audio CD; can be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, locate the section Questions and Answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been successfully picked up by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there, a window is displayed and you can select the database entry that best matches your opinion on your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD-Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field 'Current title' unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidividual per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD-Editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words with capital letters begin or not...), but also to check if there are any adverse comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the comment section. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudio creator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. consult the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the read-out CD; this is not important in this example because we don't have the & CD data anyway. for more information go to freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After selecting 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. simply enter the title of the piece in any case and any other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD; you have entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button on the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the part list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each row of a piece. only the titles that are selected are selected. a simple click on the row turns the selection of the piece on or off. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the All items at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When selecting the selection process is started by clicking on the button selection, this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what expires.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the jobs. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error message when you try to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been encoded successfully are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new record: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3. this allows reading and coding in parallel. note the status message in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. with powerful machines the result is unclear. the used machine with an AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short time appears in the top left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudio creator;, you need & kde; 3.x. resp. 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudio creator; today is within the cde; CVS as part of the box multimedia package. if you are familiar with CVS, you can download from there an anonymous copy. most distributions contain, however, a pre-compiled package, as & kaudio creator; part of an important & kde; package.</seg>

<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it runs, then the following is correct for you:</seg>

<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also supports the Linux; Ultrasound project driver that is needed for GUS maps.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop so that you can drag in & kde; any MIDI file from a & konqueror; -windows on kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files (song events or text events).</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you exit & kde; when playing a song, kmid starts again with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS maps (for the latter you need the Lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can open... from the File menu. it will appear the usual file dialog, with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window. this also works with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the record from the pop-up menu or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; (in case of several pieces, they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the slider back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly, you can click the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display and change the playback speed. to restore the original tempo, double click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a play is played, a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item, interrupts playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text, others use lyrics and others both. some pieces don't have a text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events are to be presented and even better: the EreigniType is automatically calculated, which a song is used, so that you do not have to manually set the automatic text selection. however, you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you wish to set an EreigniType, select the text event or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files you summarize. in this section you will see how you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organize.... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking Copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. at the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the items in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to no other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection will not be saved. remember when you add lots of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add. it will again appear the file dialog, by which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the Automatically add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When auto add to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the submenu sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the select list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To continue to skip a song, select the next song button, next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To reverse a song, select the Previous piece, select Preferred piece from the item menu or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter since it is not stored when you leave & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates General MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-Map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano into events of the type Change patch to Trumpet, making a trumpet sound when originally playing a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards are GM compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Every section may appear only once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the keymap..." END Define keymap "Another Keymap..." END Define Keymap... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that defaults are needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can offer support in future versions of & kmid; support can be used for devices that are not General MIDI.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, you specify how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order and leave it blank for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all the sounds that this instrument needs to sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gunshot (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with tone 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot. to do so, add the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (rifle shooting), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is the term "drum-patch" of the patch which represents a different percussion instrument (drum, pelvis, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how tones are displayed on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Like the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of rows is very important, as is the presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keywords for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Key maps are used above all to map sounds to the percussions channel. take a look at the included Keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the key map with the name Name for this channel is used. if you use the ForcePatch config option, all events will be ignored that attempt to change the patch on that channel.</seg>
<seg id="1674">For example, the ForcePatch config option can be useful to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The pitch BenderRatio value indicates in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-benefit event with the value n, it is converted with the n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM states that a keyboard which receives a pitch Bender event with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones higher up to one octave. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a little bit with & kmid; play around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-Map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. this can be found in the Settings menu, point MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you will see what sounds are currently being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed a tool, the button will no longer be green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views (until now) to display the sounds played. view the View menu from the View menu View menu: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so the same MIDI file can perform very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the instruments, the speed & etc; You have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; that happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Make sure to tick the Automatically add to the collection beforehand. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key left from the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the standard speed you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & konqueror; -Desktop with my MIDI-Folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or go (when I play a karaoke file), I only need to switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file to the & kmid window; drag.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection, turn the setting Automatically add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. open files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.Ther. First you only want to play the first file. so, set the Automatically add to the collection and open your temporary collection exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, this encourages me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga. I study mathematics at the University of Maacute; laga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I do not have much free time for my hobbies, but I try to take a little time. as hobbies I have programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files if you have a question, an error or an idea for an expansion of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me happy if you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will contact you by & kmid; however, before sending a MIDI file, you should contact me, because I might already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and won't get money from anyone for it. I would like to stress that I only keep programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AWE cards.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the AWE support, Ignacio Garcia, for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Peter Gritsch, Magnus Pepper, Thorsten Westhoder, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error notification or just a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also goes to all those excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and Karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, it can be found on its homepage, which is located at http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarpink / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and view pictures. you will also find links to sites with other karaoke songs, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you would have a sound card, except that you can of course not hear any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or phonon supported formats, as well as to play DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this machine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, please check the page The KDE website on new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always a window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. if you click an entry, its group and all its sub-groups are copied to the current category and playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not running. the various files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / directory can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to select the playlist from the playlist and select either the Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the processing mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during start and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No intro = 0 obj option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will be aware of the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be an supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation on start does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would disturb the end-animation, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photo: & lt; smiled; & lt; bodygt; & lt; mimics; / usr / koos / mum.gif "fit =" meet "/ gt; / smiles.; In the list tests / some examples of SMIL the von & KMPlayer; are supported.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab to configure MPlayer in the Configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the Configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured using the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file, like setting the backend per mimetype. here is an example of how to play a 'flash' with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even insert the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the & KMPlayer; to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer must be specified as a service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave flash in the KDE setting dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & KMPlayer; can be used in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library. the started process is called crapplayer. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">This means that a given backend is always taken for a given mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by modifying the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file. for example, the phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used must be used and the TV channels. to do so, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Quel- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo port should be used. there, ports should be detected by which one is selected. the code to use must be found (for example, it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably contained a dvb inside.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be functional. for the XFree86 server, the following must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, various names are used by KMPlayer for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, dvdnavsource, dvdsource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vedsource are used.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there any hints on how to quieter my CDROM drive when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command is to run root after the device is connected. it is absolutely essential to ensure that / dev / cdrom is shown on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine only slowly starts up, why do I have to check my CPU each time for their performance?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overhau. kxineplayer needs the last saved value automatically, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document to the following elements (the highest and subparagraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by clicking on the respective object.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful when you create your own & latex file. once a DVI-file is created, it jumps and kicks; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -Viewer to the corresponding line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI-file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the available output art of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing of DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back-up search, the elements of the DVI-file are connected to the editor and as soon as one element is clicked on an item in the DVI; file, the exact opposite of it is skipped. as soon as a section in the & latex is clicked, the corresponding point will be jumped to the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with others is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set over project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed (unless there are any errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File monitoring: in this mode, the DVI-file is at the fnovice ', and it is not called by & eyepiece; after the fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When looking at the editing toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for the quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for the quick structure of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -instructions for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field Further is for inserting items such as keywords, thread nodes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a term for a section, a picture or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (selection of a select field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a drop-down list with literary inputs is shown. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; and the & bibtex; files can be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last field of selection with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã © e is used for the definition of the font. it can be used for the main text, the foot notes, and so on. the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from the ground up by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses under the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] defines the font. if the font is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the source code example above has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the simplest way to do this is to use the MenÃ ¼ s Building or the quick-release button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & kile; automatically executes the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If you fail to compile the document, you should search for the errors in the logging process. if you are using Quick Camp, you should start automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font vole 12 is created and only a few columns shall have another font.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are supervised only within the environment (from\\ start {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many ways to increase the readability and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold printing, cursive printing, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italic print and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a sentence can be displayed italic with\\ emph {word} italic.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quota: creates a quote in the document. the quote will begin with\ start {quote} and end with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex is shown, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile is now followed.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, some adjustments may be made for the better readability of the document. at least a quote, a few places in bold and explosive pressure and a poem can be used to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor View or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (for the internal viewer). with an external viewer, its window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI-file was created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">This files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI, file are the same steps as necessary for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can then be printed using the printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI-file to other formats. once the DVI-file was created from the latex; source text, the conversion can begin in wished other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-select search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI-file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kip; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; binaries. to do this, simply setup Modern under Options... Tools Building.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to execute the pre-selection search, the mouse-cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and can be clicked on pre-selection search. the jump to the corresponding point in DVI; -Viewer is then effected.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -document from & kiste; opened and jumped to the corresponding line. for this, you have to set up & kile; in & Ocular; in & Ocular; set up as text editor (Set the Settings... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error in using Quick Camp, an error may be present. if there is an error, this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file causes the source of error in the source code. in the editor, the defaults of LaTeX errors and errors can be used for jumps between the errors. the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears. to view the defective line, the error must be clicked on the error in the logging and & kip; jumps to the defective line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">As soon as the respective button is clicked on the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used for the quick creation of a new document. more information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Hands-on users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, stored and loaded to facilitate creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file is created.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a new file, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in the box... settings General can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entering the document class. typically it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the default one.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below will be executed.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& tip; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">For more information and its options, the manual to Kate should be consulted. users of & kile; can start working directly with reading the chapter's work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called over the LaTeX reference menu. it contains an outstanding description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex; use them as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that by clicking on\\ par\\\\\ bigskip,\\ par is selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source text can be selected in the Editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the possibility to browse the most diverse types of source texts and highlight these. for example, the & latex; -commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional bookmarks within the text. in this case, it is a separate way of bookmarking within the text. the menu items' Edit 'entries or the corresponding key attributes make the jump to the next or last jump mark.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & kile; Even though it offers excellent possibilities, in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source textes added; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">This extended meaning includes tables, latex; -commands and all other lines of the source text. the only appalling thing in & kip; is that the paragraphs are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has extended meaning, since this command also has a extended meaning; commands with an back character (\\) and an additional star (*) will end up at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To add a part of the document, it is possible to select this first and remove it by pressing the Delete key. & tip; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kile; offers with own commands for a faster possibility. under Edit Removing are the following commands to add the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kip; is included in the description to edit select paragraphs.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile; for further commands in the Edit environment for a more easy work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to create the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to locate the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located in front of or within the command\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview can quickly be lost. this command will close the most recently opened environment so that the nested environment structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups specified by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the curative bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curving closing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the curly clip of a & tex; group #, the other end of the group jumps (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many nested braces, the most recently opened group can be lost. this command will close the last opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple instructions are used as GÃ ¤r. for the beneficial implementation, the character is used in & kile; the "sign" is used for two simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic double-entry badge can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX to be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Foreign specific settings can also be used (for example, n german or French) and thus German or French suits. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">If the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), a smart line breaks. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), add not only a newline but also the\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment, the line is called & kile; the current line with\\\\ with an end of line breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is smart enough to support preset & latex; - or user-defined environments.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to sort the columns in tables environments and thereby assign all Et-characters (amp;) to each other. at the bottom of Shift; Alt; amp; search & kile; after the next tab in the above line.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Even though it offers a good source code execution, it has been added in & kip; in order to include special commands (mostly for & latex;). there are three different modes. all of these modes can be set up for different working modes under Options...</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment will begin with the command\\ begin {environment} & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to grind the completion list. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are nately removed when selecting a command. alternatively, skipping marks can be inserted, so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by means of a jump mark NÃ ¤chst jump mark and then the desired parameters can be entered.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Settings box; set up... kip; Consistent settings can be made to these lists. you can select different lists of lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as users of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not necessary for computation of environments. it will always have to enter a few characters with\\ begin and the invocation mode will have a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & kile; a special mode for the execution of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When activating the complete environment or the key Alt + Shift key, the command to process the environment is automatically opened and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the ambient noise can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this has been accomplished, the environment will be automatically closed again. once & kip; recognizes that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... kip; Consistent settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the complete list of fullscreen mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">The lists can be set up under Settings Kile... Kile Vercompletion. as an example of a drop-off list, the file example.cwl, in which the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word completed by editing Vercompletion or the key Ctrl + Alt-space key, the letter L will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>

<seg id="1852">The Graphics dialog is designed to create graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics of graphics formats, the sections should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as popular as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for the changes and reordering of pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to examine the results of the work, the source code needs to be compiled. all construction tools are grouped in groups in the MenÃ ¼ s Create, create conversion and create view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source text for the observer like the eyepiece, or the other conversion can be used the key alto; 2. afterwards, the DVI-file can be viewed by Alt; 3, via Alt; 4, and can be viewed in a PS file using Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When the command is used, a viewer is usually called after the compile. if no built-in viewer is used, a new window will open every time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is about the project "Neues Project...." here the following information for the project is queried:</seg>

<seg id="1859">The script function of & kile; allows to execute ECMAScript code. scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet developed, and can be used in other versions of & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & kip; a system-wide object (= kip) with the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages. & kile; offers a lot of different help to support the users.</seg>

<seg id="1917">Anyone who has worked with the & kde; documentation knows what it's all about. let's take it a bit, let's give it a graphical interface! no longer need to rely on a terminal; just click on the icon for the XML processor and done!</seg>
<seg id="1918">This application is waiting for a index.docbook in the folder. if index.docbook is in the required working folder, then leave the current working folder. if not, then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the folder in the other folder field.</seg>
<seg id="1919">Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous & html files are deleted every time you run myproc.</seg>
<seg id="1920">As already said, everyone who has worked on the & kde documentation knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus, there is now a great graphical interface for this.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the newly opened file is index.docbook then simply select the current work folder. if not, then select the current work folder and enter the folder where index.docbook is to be found.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus, invite, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. thus, the plug-in system becomes very powerful. you can benefit from additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the desired in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a part, we start editing plugins using the Edit menu. this opens the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all contained plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; -element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when you add plugins without a location, & quantaplus, use this path to find the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Multiple persons often work in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as both team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Top names and attitudes of one's own identity are important with regard to messages and annotations. see for further information on notes.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing members of the team: it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see in for more detailed information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later, how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file into CVS, or when it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">In the event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the addsat can be a team or sub-project leader.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">It can either be selected from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a comment section followed by Comment.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Comments can be sent to a member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the team member's nickname, role plays a role in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around the parentheses are invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages supported by DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are available via the Settings menu. here, only via & quantaplus, -Specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using the Quanta settings... This dialog covers some pages that are dealt with one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; with regard to tags, including car completion, can be changed with this. entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Tags: large / small-write of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal bulk / lowercase means the tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal case / lowercase means, the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags: when checked, tags, for which the closing tag is optional, will be added immediately after & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update start and end date: if enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the appropriate coding while typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detecting different types of files. the standard specifications can be restored using the Default button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created files or in other ways other than the file opening (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been detected. however, this setting is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; generates backup copies regularly so that during a power failure or crash the document can be recovered from this backup at the next start of the program. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a cage), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset window settings to the default setting at the next start is useful when the user interface has been messed up by modifying the MDI modes and docking / unlocking views. it corresponds to the --reset layout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by means of non-inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; change the display of symbols instead of scripts, as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and source text view in shared mode. see the different modes.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, which represents the figure of the parser-node in the document, can be set into details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structural tree settings, the visibility of knots in the tree, the frequency of the tree when editing, and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty knot are empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are available in groups, each one can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifrank shortcut means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be administrated. plug-ins are KPart-applications from the third party, which can be reused by any KPart capable application, most known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard directory like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in "read-only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only-Lese-Kparts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then testet & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct. if the plug-in is not available at the moment, it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus, from version 3.3, the error search was completely redeveloped. the support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as well as support for the dbg debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept has been implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; insert.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable Debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view where the content of monitored variables will be displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all holding points are listed, with time numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debugger if necessary, or it tells the plug-in to listen to debugger requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger so that normally don't have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugger session starts the session. includes the connection to the debugger or terminates the listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to deduce a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is shown in the debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and sending information about the monitored variables as well as the current line running. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script without going into the features or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the statement and move to the next as if it were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Open a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is an & kde; front end and a KPart of xsldbg that can be found at http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how to increase & quantaplus, adapt to your needs and how to help you become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing Packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; they enable & quantaplus. their simplicity and flexibility makes from & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; s & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag and descriptionrc; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbolic-orientated ledges of image buttons (above the editing window), which insert text and statements more quickly into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details about conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, den & quantaplus; for the day shows. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the Tag.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag files are nothing but folders. they only contain the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag files bear the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about possibilities and limitations is presented in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can occur only once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing else than the only element type above itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for class class. the name of the class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Valid only for the Type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">Yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only be used once for each attribute. it defines the name and type of the attribute. in addition, there are other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used for filling in tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to achieve source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% day name%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that grouped the elements of a list together. it can only occur for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once (for example once per & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each field; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Gives a list of elements that finish one day. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with an & XML; -declarations: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but look out & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt;. this will not cause a fracture, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; -window to start and check tagXML. another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This feature is currently not available. currently, checking is carried out only when the TagXML files are loaded in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">This file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a functioning family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; Excel function is described. the filename of this TagXML file will be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag &gt; & lt; tag &gt; & lt; tag &gt; & lt; tag &gt; & lt; attr name = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, reachable via DTD editing DTD settings. this allows diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; for a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = turn 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD specification. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings... created. click New action to create the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The key shortcut assigned to this action. with clicking the user defined button, a shortcut can be assigned; with Keine, the current key shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when the action is executed, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document), can be started. examples from & quantaplus, themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This allows & quantaplus to find the script in the following locations: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in your path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced with the URL of the current document. in the case of a local document, file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process. if von & quantaplus, only one instance runs, the text is unique to PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used for controlling & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document, or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script input from & quantaplus can be entered; in the input field input can be specified, which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected Text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script, the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages are directed to the standard error message.</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create an own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore one can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all required fields and add the tag to the matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use them, enable the "Edit tag" dialog when available so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? we replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Diagram Other Programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size andern.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by the use of green (green is mostly called off, starte, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking on this symbol will insert & lt; startings; -Tag in the current document will insert.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this happens via the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and select the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, if there are some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared for a better overview by some dividers into multiple groups. open the toolbar to set dialog via Settings tool bar. make sure the tool bar you want is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this will add the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the dividers support the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar might believe that the & konqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by halving all the symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After new eXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your file descriptionrc; so that your toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened from the respective type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantaplus; for the normal user, it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to search for an existing documentation for the format / script / etc; then you have to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # Elements in the main index TopElement = Your description for those documentaries e.g., PHP; Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.html, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.html, # Sec2.html tags 2 = day 1.html tags 2 = day 3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, look now in the & PHP; documentation like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is sub-folders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it out yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is directly referenced to a file (and consequentially at the top end of tree view & mdash; folder will appear!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but be careful & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files being replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; scripts, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function should be displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (context list) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of shared context elements that are to be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that they are good and worthy to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, for example what documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the disk resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or else whom. in different places there is an email menu entry, such as DTD DTD packet (DTEP) with email, the toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the Scripting tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; -users can download them. to make a substantial contribution, we recommend to sign the resources for which there is a GPG / PGP key. this ensures the origin of the resources, both for our team and for the future users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for your private gpg key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the dialog New resource the input fields have to be filled out (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), the toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message will appear with the indication of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not yet by & quantaplus. however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in XML format. there is a simpler way to convert DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD load and Convert button. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that is to be used. then the following dialog will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string that in! Doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: if enabled, & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with details of newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand these and gain full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the division is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus. everything that is marked as global is stored in the joint folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available to anyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which enables the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of a number of main areas: the Editor window, the construction reviews, the flashcards with information and the toolbars. please click in, and for more information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the right mouse button to select a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all tab, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, skipping to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right angles in the editor area lead to a further context menu on the processed document content, such as basic edit steps (cutting / pasting / paste), editing the tag under the cursor, or opening the file, if the string under the mouse cursor refers to a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the upper end of the editor window are the editor's toolbars. at present, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as default, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, for example & lt; insert it into your document, then click on the tag that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction views (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open them and strip them. in the presentation with flashcards are available for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation construction views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows administrators to manage files in the project by right click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage medium can be executed using the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">An additional feature of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are always available, local templates only for the relevant user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of the spin-off in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one displays the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element. by right-clicking an element opens a list of commands related to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, it can quickly change attributes and namespaces. the application system aligned with the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus, from quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus, two flashes at the bottom of the window, can be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and any changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbars is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of & quantaplus, files on your system. therefore autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of your bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus; has been optimised for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a obvious idea: what if & quantaplus, a stand-alone, extensible markup-language editor would? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer confined to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus, well advanced on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for that the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be kept that & quantaplus; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; developer community. & quantaplus; follow, in good use of free software, the idea of Why do anyone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only this all possible, but allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI). this can dramatically increase productivity. by using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for quick web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More details can be found with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and managed by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, where the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. see the section on Templates. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / Project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted when inserting from the clipboard there are special Notes on & HTML; -Note, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from clipboard into & URL; -Note, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily for inserting & URL; s used in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the selection to or off. this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift; key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your PHP; -script gives error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and pre-defined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of script functions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">On and off the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter will be activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set Bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. that allows, for example, to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde, and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus, manage the project. see the details explained in the chapter & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in Project You / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be set by setting actions... and tool bars will be saved using toolbar toolbars, or you will be asked when asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the hard drive. if you have not saved the toolbar yet, you will be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download one & DTD; you or anyone else made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it is useful if the entities of the & DTD are to be refreshed without updating the entire & DTEP; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu item in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus is denied; inserting tool bar is denied when this tag contradicts the rules at this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items above. click enabled. click on an activated plug-in deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlight mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the posters; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line-ending identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes take time or cause unbeautiful graphics. the card-card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus, 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; -web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of posters, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbars, or which add and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse-pointer, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled in from top to bottom, as the entire directory structure for the rest of the project is completed automatically after filling the project name. all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lower case letter and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine you want to access, except for processing local data. either a name (hostname.g..de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field blank, the default settings of the selected log will be used. depending on the remote host's setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let it be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started anew, no hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise selection according to coupons.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the files by hooks or, by removing the tick, exclude from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu tree with Project Properties in the subwindow profiles or Shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders) that are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to the above, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened. it can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This can be used to select the debugger you want. currently only Gubed is supported. more information on Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the lower-window profiles, high load profiles (see in) can be set as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, by pointing an own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the Team Configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn on event actions and add, change or delete actions. event actions are executed when a pre-defined event occurs, such as the backup of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was open. you can't influence this behavior right now.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Project... from the Project or the Symbol Project open from the toolbar. open the Project dialog and allow the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus is closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files will find. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behaves as well, but the entries are missing and opened with... in the right mouse button menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will be dazzled to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Remember that the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten on programs. this option is useful when frequent upload of files is necessary and the rather insecure password on disk save option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-load profiles can be created to upload the project (or parts of the project) to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied. either a full-qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it according to your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be easily read, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored, opened or deleted from the Project toolbar menu or the Project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus, to their own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus are best stovable using the toolbar menu. using and adding is different. the addition of toolbars is treated below in the Add tool bar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Toolbars and symbols on it can be set either using context menu (right-click on toolbar), where a new tool bar can be removed, tool bar rename or toolbar can be executed, which can be specified, which actions on this or other toolbar are to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will also be removed and action modified which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu... and set settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code cutlets and files linking. & quantaplus, basically use templates such as a common filesystem with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you present for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus. supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually inserted in documents using shortcuts (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples are available in the template-tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, special documents are made in appropriate subfolders. a simple framework for the purpose and organises the work in such a way to be efficient.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template, but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment about a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire sites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. there are currently no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and choose File Add as template As a local template store....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has been done, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File Save as template to save your selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily dragged and dragged to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for this, such as drag and drop or paste over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project files, you can click a folder on the right and create site template, enter a name for the template and back up. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very target-oriented approach. you can pretend headers and footers or dynamically interact with & PHP; design, insert files or link them to them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A drop-down selector with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled as soon as parental attributes have been attached.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template list. if a root folder is set to such a path, it would generally disable templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text block. if nothing appears, you will probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows predefined or imprinted text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying contents templates to a folder with special headlines / footers to equip a whole presentation with the matching headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (show right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & Source editor that can be accessed via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor when needed, in which the implemented changes are visible in the VPL; editor in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that contains & PHP; a small green symbol indicates the default of & PHP; source text. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit it, the source text editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source editor as well as in the VPL editor, and the cursor is activated in the source text editor and in the VPL editor.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Quanta. after choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation applies: a small gap for fast calculators and a big span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the web page, so the editing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; editor is possible. the document properties dialog will also be called as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is created. this is to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself, for example keywords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows the content change, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key word 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing the look of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change on the list is exactly as with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is not currently supported.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made a lot of changes while at the same time correcting the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where the indentation might have changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently of each other at a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously display the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly.</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you to compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when merging the folder:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays exact differences and resists the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more trouble when somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by just writing the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 kdiff3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog allows you to manually type file names, select from the file browser (file...) or select an recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog will show your selection and displays them again next time. you do not have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, for B and C, however, a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field for the target is active and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily necessary to set an output file immediately. you can also do this later when you save.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Settings button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison will start immediately. in open dialog, you don't have to select files, you can close the dialog with the abrupt button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you would only have to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; then copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at the moment you can do nothing out of & kdiff3; pull out. only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and inserting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, allow the mouse to rest for a while over the line. then a small help window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed using the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, the color indicates which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when comparing three files. that is good in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. when differences are found in white characters, the color is displayed. in some programming languages, where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted in places where the respective source file does not have lines. if the line breaks are enabled, the line is represented with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [Gechange] if you edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons Springe to next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, every difference is at the same time a conflict which has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, by automatic merging or manual editing, there is no more line left in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; No row in the queue; displayed. this is only a placeholder in the event that you may change your mind and perhaps again select another source. this text appears neither in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you may copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources, ignoring the options or ignoring Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page, side, beginning, end, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl-end, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the shared window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insert button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already explained in the merging and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation that you can skip to the current / first / last difference, the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upside / Ctrl-picture downward) or to the next / previous conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, you must copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is enabled, whatever you mark will be automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is omitted. however, be careful with this option, because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not retain the end of the source files, so you should not use them with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically when loading and restored at the next start. (setup menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides typefaces with variable width to choose, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic font. if the selected font does not support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered scastert. on these systems the button Preferences automatically introduces an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when the tabulator button is pressed. otherwise a tabulator character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press Enter or Return, the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard is no longer necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which type of line you prefer to save. the default value is the generally accepted option on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, try & chDiff3; first, to find all the completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. in this step, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a cart '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of one line, others only save a newline '\'. usually, the character return characters may look identical, but then they may be disabled with different sizes in page-to-page comparison.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored, but in the result the differences are displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. comments in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will be displayed before continuing to jump to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically resolves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white signs are less important in many files. note that the Automatic Selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and performing a merge. look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already exists an older version, the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need to shut down and restart so that the change is active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set global over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if this option is checked, the top setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">A short note of what is the local code (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you).</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which code to use for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, they may not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only deal with 8-bit ASCII.) This option allows you to set the code for the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">This also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd rather want to use the space available on the screen for long lines. simply select the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arrange the comparison windows next to each other or overlap. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes look at the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as preset names for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge operation, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first be handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches exactly your requirements. you can use this function, for example, to cut troublesome parts or correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first be handed over to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), the output of the command is used only in line balance. you can write your own preprocessor that matches exactly your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program this themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line balance to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ulular expression that matches all characters in one line. the\\ 1 in the substitution string refers to the found text in the first letter. the\\ U converts the found text into capital letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all of them follow the same pattern $keyword generated text $.</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for line abouts. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Any sign between' ['and'] is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so basically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several substitutions at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead you can use something different like perl. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replace / SCHALTER'Allergies are different in perl few details. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal pre-processor are maintained for viewing and merging. other operations only change the data that the line balance algorythm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you are using a normal preprocessor, the line balance preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and shows simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... executes selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparison and merging of files. you only need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder was specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not the merge. to start the merge, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed of a small news window about the current progress. if you cancel scanning the folders, only the files that have been compared to that point will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder it displays & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found while scanning is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can flip up a folder by clicking on the + / - or double-clicking on the object, or by double-clicking the arrow keys for left / right.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the colour is identical even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire contents are identical. then also folders have the same color. for folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirtiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green, then turns yellow and later when it is old, turns red.</seg>

<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged, and select the new file instead of merge (unsafe) is enabled, then examine & kdiff3; the date of the files, but show the same date, then an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not eliminated, the merging of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file is processed after the other. the Status column displays Fertig if the merge has been successful, and other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is completed, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will show more columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, then in the three-folder merging mode C will be used as the target, when B is selected as a target and when syncing, A and / or B will be used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries that should be in the target folder will also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options to skip over certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / resume in the list menu or press F7 (the key shortcut). to only merge the current input: select the action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">When nonconflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears that indicates the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialogue window appears with the options Conducting, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulate if you just want to see what would happen without the real changes made. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then perform certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, start / resume directory merge again or press F7. if you haven't saved it, a corresponding dialog will appear. then drag & kdiff3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; hit a fault, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem otherwise before you continue merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, drag & drop; these entries (in the current session) will not work together again. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered complete. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Settings menu - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. several patterns can be entered. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many self-formatted files are ignored by CVS, the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .cvsignor file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a hiding attribute. in other filesystems a previous punt. marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is turned off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: if the option is turned off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the links like normal folder will be treated and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible recursions.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of solved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large files to a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The files are considered to be identical if they are equal. this can be useful, for example, if the modification date has been lost when copying. please use caution. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enables the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging files are selected in such a way that after that both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are saved in both folders.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the newer file is proposed as an action. (this is considered unsafe because it assumes the knowledge that the other file was not modified too.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension is already existing, it will be deleted without further backup. this also applies to the normal merge of individual files, not only merging whole folders. this option is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually, the Folder-merging view is visible during the merging of single files; you can move the window-divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can turn off the main window in the Window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory and the text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. however, there is also a corresponding menu entry in the -menu. you can also merge a single file directly from the merge menu. once you save the result, the status will be reset to Erleeve and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: list menu: read new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. this allows you to specify the files and folders that are located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes due to the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder. then a file is always assumed to be a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or modification date deviate from the original. (note the check option of the size.) (this is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as a difference-viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, right-click on the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part display from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually, & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as KPart, & kdiff3; assuming that the input file is a patch file in unified format. at least one of the two files must exist. at least one of the two files must exist.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can click on a patch file and select Preview in - KDiff3Part. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it supports only comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools called KDiff and KDiff2 (now they are compact) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs very long and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or that they will go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from sources and probably didn't tell the configure script to KDE. in default configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will first be treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too large so far. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit larger volumes of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text it is suddenly lt; No src has left; appeared and the text can't be deleted. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how you can use KDE on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the latest changes can be found at http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake are used, you should not have any problems with compiling. however, if difficulties persist, please refer to the & kde; -mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Delete) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift insertion) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replace the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to re-read the folder after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files will not be copied to the target folder when merging them. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging them. (the behavior is switched off in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the caption A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present).</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a miniature preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite handy to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, to stop them or shift them. this works in both a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible in both a desktop and on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & ppager; clicked, the context menu only has to set up the two entries Pager... and exit. if however based on an application inside & Kpager, the icon and the name of the application, as well as the entries Minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and Finish. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is checked, the names of the virtual desktops will be displayed in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field to the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is displayed along with name, the names are provided with folder numbers, eg. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the & Kpager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is checked, the running programs will be shown as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only the empty spaces will be displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple, simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with its default icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically let & Kpager; in a 2xN-grid, all virtual desktops appear in a horizontal row, which is very good for the representation at the side on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, view and move the windows as symbols or with its content. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then select switch setup... lets the dialog box appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you don't have a write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager; part of the kdebase package, you will need a functioning installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features. it is optimized for use on low-performance machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & putt, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag is shown in the magnified area of the screen. below, this window appears as a magnifying window. the picture shown in the magnification window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to below as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting magnified & Kmag; the area around the mouse-cursor as a mobile magnifier. alternatively, you can indicate a selected screen area in the magnifying window (dropdown mode) or the surroundings of the mouse-line at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse cursor setting. please note that the mouse pointer is not yet able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard kde; / Qt; mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the dropdown mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse-cursor in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifying window. this can also be done with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift key, or use the & MMB, you can move the selection box.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save it into a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the picture and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">When stopping the update causes the CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (very low, low, medium, high, very high). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a select window will be displayed. the selected area will be displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& Kmag; automatically uses your set short instructions for saving files, opening a new window, printing, reloading (with the button Document again loading in & konqueror;), Enlarge and size reduction & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">It may also be used as a magnifier; you can use a magnifier, so as if you use a magnifier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo. this application is useful for different people: from research or artist to web designer or visual handicapped.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click whenever the mouse cursor persist for a while at the same place. it is meant to help people who suffer from the repetitive Strain Panel (RSI) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain. furthermore, it can emulate pulling with the mouse. this requires a little practice however.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, the mere moving of the mouse can cause pain. if you suffer from pain related to the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you break the movement briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button emulated. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the drawing with pressed mouse button. the smart move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; takes a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligent shifting is enabled, the shooting time is enabled (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the mouse button is waiting, before releasing the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse takes place in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this feature is enabled, it creates a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, one click with the right mouse button. this move is stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears delayed, you can drag & kde; move to the sound & multimedia center; go to Sound & Multimedia, select sound system and here the General tab. there is a slider that you set to lower the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; at each start of & kde; started. this function is currently only available at & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the application button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the last push of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">It's best to use & kmousetool; first with pre-settings. in particular, the smart move should be switched off at first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later postpone the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; for sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click will remain without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window, which do not represent a link, does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse clicks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should quickly be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. you can scrape the dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you are using the smart move in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to move the cursor to where you want it. however, you can park the mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop if you want to have a keypad. safe zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent shifting, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very well possible to select this way text, copy it into the clipboard and insert it again or execute any other action by which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using it & kmousetool; instead, simply select text by clicking on the one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will always play when & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the shift time starts when moving intelligently.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the XTest add-on for & X Window; this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and a loudspeaker, and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor remained brief. this program was developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and who prepares the stuffiness of the mouse keys.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced abilities of ktops; for normal working with ktops; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is processed before it is sent to speech-dispatcher. they are useful for improving pronunciation in order to replace misspoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker, or to bypass certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the way filters work, it is important to know how the program "speech-dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen-Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the output of the Screen Reader has been read, the retained jobs will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Alerts have the next priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News is the highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; read a long text on a website, you can with & kmouth; notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order you send orders from the map sheet is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts which do not have any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of Screen-Readers. if an application sends the output of a Screen-Readers, while & ktops, this output is stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages, and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter process the text and pass it on to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are implemented as modules. in the future there can be even more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be delivered with predefined character cassette inserters that allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for re-formatting messages from & Conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; reformers use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With voice selection filters, you can send orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktops. if you have set a female voice for example on the card's card speaker, you can read text from KDE's messages on it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied for voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it will continue the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or an & kde; message is sent, it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the bottom of the page. processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the normal filters configured. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are executed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the further below setup dialogs will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">You have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns for the setting up of string replacement filters. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name, it must differ only from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Replace. the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>

<seg id="2644">If a value is entered, the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs will be given with the program qdbus; the & dbus; numbers must leave you away. if for example & qdbus; the application ID header 3432 indicates, you may just type in the copy.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter is applied to the text only if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen Filter if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the character set filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\. so the words must be limited on both sides by delimiters (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; regular & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Phrases can be found in the deutils package.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The speech-dispatcher program uses an adaptable modular architecture for speech synthesizers. if you want to extend the use of another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc utility is used for the support of SSml and for the & XML; conversion filter, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & ktt, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later), including packages kdelibs and the development files for the program "speech-dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; downloaded from the source text archive for kdeported or downloaded the tarball you currently have created, install and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use your speech synthesizer, check first if speech-Dispatcher works correctly with your speech synthesizer. to do so, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktops; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of ktops; the program kttmsgr will be developed in such a way that the setup of speech-dispatcher is possible directly and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is divided into individual sentences. the user can go back to sentences or paragraphs, repeat, pause or cancel the issue.</seg>
<seg id="2684">For example, if you have set up a speaker whose language is female and whose gender is female, it will be used, otherwise the best speaker will be chosen automatically. if you want to know more about how & ktts; a speaker, you will see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add Speaker on Add to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the card speaker setup will be displayed. as an example, the installation of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. for details on the modules, please refer to.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the detailed festival program. if the path to festival is included in PATH, you only have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival. in the case of voices that are punctuated, this setting will be automatically made. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these slider you adjust volume, speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you can't select some regulator and this is displayed in grey, the voice chosen by you will not allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need to be loaded for several seconds because of their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD, so that (with bigger memory consumption) the first set will be synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not set up a speaker (or forget to click on user). see.</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window is displayed on kttsmgr. otherwise, after the start, only the icon kttsmgr is visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr runs not yet, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the job, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the currently edited rate. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card's ID.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With buttons in this row you can move forward or backward in the order that is selected in the list below. (but not every order consists of several sentences).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on OK, all changes in the settings (also on the other flashcards) are taken over and kttsmgr will be reduced to the icon in the system section. then click on this icon to show the program window again.</seg>

<seg id="2700">Set the subscriber speed here. 50nbsp;% corresponds approximately half and 200nbsp;% approximately the double normal speaking speed. so that these adjustments can be implemented, the program must be sox installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click Apply to take over the new settings for the running & ktops system.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. most of them will not work. you need to find out which device works with you. in doubt, choose Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this map you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of voice orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of Screen-Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. once the Screen Reader has been read, the ordered orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Alerts have the next highest priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News has the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks out messages. if you are & eg; just read a long text on a website, you can come with & kmouth; still someone who enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">A text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, adds & ktts; the audio output into the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory messages are active, the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders. there are no special actions for messages, warnings, and the expenses of screen reavers if these are interrupted by a message with a higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktats; to read KNotify messages, run kttsmgr and click Notifications. the flashcards menu will pop up.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Select this check box to turn the reading of & kde; notifications. if this setting is not selected, the remaining settings are disabled and ktops; read no notifications.</seg>
<seg id="2712">When this setting is selected, notifications with which a sound is played are not read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. if you click the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message, the & Conversation; sent when someone mentions your nickname in an IRC message.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events, for which nothing else is stated in the list, are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this drop-down selector to specify what & ktops; do when an event arrives. you have the following choices:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you have selected Custom Text, enter the text you want. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter here the properties of the speaker you want. standard selects the speaker, which is shown in the list on the list on the top of the list.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application, it will be executed. otherwise, the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSml) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also brands for controlling the pronunciation of e.g. abbreviations. SSml is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktats; SSml only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the standard voice, the festival uses in the edition of SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100x;%, SSml text is usually spoken very monotonous.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! Doctype speak PUBLIC "- / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN" http: / / www.w3.org / speech synthesis / synthesis.dtd "&gt; Who has slept in my bed? asked Mama bear.]] &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punctuation filters (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide text into individual sentences. this can start & ktops. this way you can skip or pause or pause on the card's card or pause, even if the speech synthesizer does not directly support this.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the statute-limiter filter. at the first start of & ktts, a set limiter filter is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add additional rules limiter filters, but beginners will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to do this is to try out the choice of speakers and select text to read. switch back the speakers selector, select which speaker, select the speaker, change some properties and check how the speaker's choice changes.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then quicker to start reading, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">If the voice synthesizer does not support this function, you can pause or cancel orders on the card card.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limiter filter is set up automatically when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuation filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tab character (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard set limit filter retains the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of Screen Readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal statute-limiter filter from references, you can paste it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">You can overwrite the speaker settings for the application on the box of the speakers.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top one on the card's speaker). in other words: no spreader properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which has all the characteristics of a set-up speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select this speaker. otherwise select the speaker that matches the original features originally set.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the speaker you want. if this property doesn't matter, don't enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property should have precedence over other properties. you can also set multiple markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language lies ahead when you know that a particular application text is sent in a different language than the one inserted in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the field speaker, which is most likely to delete the following, click the default speaker button and then use Speaker, which is most likely to follow the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number, the input is 0).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it is started. I have compiled debug support, but I don't get any traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer 0.8.x is the serial port-0.8. if the problem is not solved by this, you may need to install a non compatible version of GStreamer. you can try updating or deinstalling GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output of ALSA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application. when I stop a text order, it freezes & ktops; on the & console; appears a message stating: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system there is the problem that conflicts with ALSA occur which prevent simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed them and can use them in festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / Voices. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In order for this to work, the program needs to be installed sox and can be found on the environment variable PATH. some synthesizer modules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the card's card for intercom devices.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the subscriber speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSml.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & html; after & XML; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSml conversion filter, and set up the subscriber speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read websites with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but & ktt; read the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that festival does not produce any mistakes, the xsl file for converting SSml to Saber is the GENDER-tags. the same applies to VOICE tags as well.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added your own label release filter and now I can go in & ktops; no longer move forward or backward. on the preceptor orders will be displayed, the order consists of only one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon) are not allowed to filter out. instead use a filter for the set limit recognition for these characters instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is installed on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure that the modules are registered for GStreamer by calling the command-register before using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / gaspahtop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in the audio output. if your system also counts, you can't simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktts; freezes if you stop a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the ALSA (dmix) website.</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support any real breaks. if you hold a text order in & ktts, the current set will be read aloud.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The sox audio program is used for general setting of the subscriber speed, but otherwise it is not necessarily necessary. Debian users can then install the apt-get install sox command. the program is already included on most of the Linux; CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">If you have downloaded & ktats; as tarball (with tar packed archive), log in as normal user and unzip the tarball into a suitable folder. change to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 is the module & arts; probably removed or at least only created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a running time dependency of non-free software. (non-free according to the guidelines of Debian distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2765">Default is & ktops; installed in / opt / kde3. if this folder is not specified in the environment variable $KDEDIRS, you must specify the --prefix = destination option.</seg>

<seg id="2767">CD dictionecho kttsd &gt; inst-apps make -f Makefile.cvs. / configure cd kttsd make su make install</seg>
<seg id="2768">Before you start using the synthesizer, check first if your speech synthesizer is working properly. follow the instructions you received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good and multiple voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You must install at least one language. help with this can be found in the instructions provided with the festival. if you want to read Web pages, you must install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The voice is still in an early stage of development. unzip the software in festival / lib / Voices / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to enter the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a cyrillic (8-bit) coding as for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux; distributions. therefore search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech language, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to an 8-bit Cyrillic as for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; synthesizer. then Festival takes over lexical analysis and & MBROLA; generated from it the audio output. the & MBROLA; -program and the & MBROLA; voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; not a complete voice output system. & MBROLA; generates language from Diphone files. you need additional software to create this diphone. festival generates these from & MBROLA; required Diphone. txt2pho can also be produced from German lyrics Diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2778">In this process, additional wrapper code is added to the festival to use & MBROLA; voices to voice synthesis. note that the & MBROLA; voice files won't be installed in & MBROLA; folder, but in the / lib / folder directory.</seg>
<seg id="2779">IMS German Festival is a modified version of festival for german & MBROLA; voices. required is either festival version 1.4.1 or festival 2.0 (1.95beta). first install festival and & MBROLA; then download MS German Festival from</seg>

<seg id="2820">A machine with DNS support replaces a full domain command through the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the host requesting http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will resolve this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator allows you to easily manage this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS entries can be sorted by selecting a listing and listing or downgrading in the list with buttons Add-down or down priority.</seg>

<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the pre-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; in addition, the development packages with libraries and other things are required.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given; in the second, all of & knetworkconf; variable configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace advanced knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found great dissemination. IPv6 is expected to run through in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address is to be assigned to a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace, the network administrator is the contact person running a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, usually addresses in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called default route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own machine).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. usually the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes modified dynamically in DSL lines, so it will not be surprised if there is another content specified in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar that also offered the ability of dds2tar for quick, selective packaging.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be included in & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; get back the tape and read the band's pre-tensioning information. detect & kdat; don't recognize the pre-credits on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">If you can't find it, you will be asked if the index will be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the volume of the tape can now be searched by unfolding the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; by changing the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be discarded without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to save data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat; if your tape drive requires a tape to be formatted before use, it must be formatted before using the tape of & kdat. floppy tape drives are usually preceded by a formatting of the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity goes & kdat; continuing with the format of the tape. all data on the tape is lost! after completing the formatting process, the band is automatically integrated and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you initiate the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a security profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Rightclick the local file tree and select...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is started, the dialog box opens for backup. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for the backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the backup will appear. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives for the band with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in any of the archives and select the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the checkout process has been started, the dialog appears for review. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the check, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the examination procedure as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files to be recovered must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Rightclick a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore in the Reset menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog box appears for Recovery. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the restoration settings, the dialog will appear again. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the tape indexfile on the basis of the tape content. this procedure deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can recompile the index on two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a security profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under backup files, only the files on the same filesystem are backed up, such as the folder. folders that are on other filesystems can be stored separately from backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; files have not been fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, it transmits & kdat; before the tape is integrated, the command takes the load to the drive. on some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; block the throw at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when resolving the integration of & kdat; automatically discarded the band. do not use this option with Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. regardless of whether this setting is active or not, you must & kdat; in any case, share the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should contain only one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be administrated directly with & GNU; even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is an & kde; Viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to receive information about your system, or where the system provides the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to receive information about your system, or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; hence, try to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshots, & ksystemlog; functions to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; first, the system log file - the system log - will open. it will not be displayed, and it opens itself instead of a small news window, so you have & ksystemlog; most likely, do not have system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in / var / log, for normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or string. enter a string in the filter bar. the list of the log lines will now be displayed automatically, so that only minutes will be displayed, if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the log file system log, select the column process, and in addition, enter the name of a process in the system bar, so you will be able to show all the protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more noticeable color than protocol lines of step indication.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain processes (for example in the system log or in the sync protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new upcoming protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the Window menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has an own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. You will find more current information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and also named) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly develops into the standard for the control of the program start when booting the system in the Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone could try to change a machine to System V Init without re-installing and reformatting. the Linux kernel first looks in / etc after an init file. therefore, you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs also from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. dort, you will find rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you will need a script for any system service you want to start when you boot up the system or switch to another runlevel. system services do not include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is started only once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port when you boot up.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places after the program and starts the first it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the default level 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful when you have passed a little messed up by rebooting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually run these scripts from hand on command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server runlevel that only lets httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, that's & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starting.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; using a mouse or other pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runways to start (or stop) at this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between runway or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new area. to only copy them to a new running level, you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Sometimes the type number of an entry can't be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the numbers of the surrounding entries before trying again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to enable the different work areas (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cutting to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sort number or the name of an entry manually, press the input key to open the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runaround, and now the machine is constantly restarted. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in the individual user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runtime X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary programming programs of these distributions, but does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution: please check if all configuration files are available (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are unavailable or configured incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runtime distribution varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that it can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adapting & kuser; read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must save them. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two flashcards, the user group and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only shown when you have advanced system settings. only if you have activated space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings. other cards will appear if shadow passwords, e.g. / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card appears if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map only appears if the space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized for at least one-time filesystem space limitation (see the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected with wildcards using the field filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The Groups tab informs about the group belonging to the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group dialog properties include a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group, or click the matching toolbar Add-on. editing or deleting the selected group or the selected group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boat manager, add, remove and modify the boot password, change the time to boot the standard operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
