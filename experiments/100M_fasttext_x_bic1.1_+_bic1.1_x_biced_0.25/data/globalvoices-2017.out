although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time now .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and used his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
when I was 14 , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was me , as if it is absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only intensified my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never thinks behind the mountain as they say so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in favor of him .
the 13 million votes he won in Republi@@ can elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters to the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which receives people from all over the world , a deeply beli@@ ever person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
Tru@@ mp didn &apos;t agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati in@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights the environment for her life and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp beha@@ ved his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception to the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , gave the presi@@ dency to a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them ?
in other words , would they say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t for those who look different from him .
this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note . O.@@ B. ) : as much as white against all other ethnic groups . &quot; white in allu@@ rement to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means so much like whi@@ pl@@ ash injuries ) , as the big Van Jones described , killed exactly what America did so splen@@ di@@ dly .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which beliefs or background you may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this land chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ eer , whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp , however , there is a huge part of the White America that promises this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , that &apos;s not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is now called Tru@@ mp Country , the message said .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could no longer find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music through rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an town of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
the fact that the music played in both places has changed not only the life of the children but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is on the edge of a large land@@ fills , just 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular with tourists , but worlds apart from nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which , with their musical instruments , has found a way to overcome poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its abuse of drugs and ban@@ anas .
but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare hope for the young .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga to play .
music from Tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest land@@ fill of As@@ un@@ cion in Paragu@@ ay@@ an capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material :
music with instruments made up of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to transform parts of the decay into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all made of rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls :
at first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in rub@@ b@@ ish . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something he had never seen before : a rub@@ b@@ ish made violin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made up of recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
land@@ fill harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specifically about international , practiced solutions for environmental issues .
the re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the joint use of content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law@@ break@@ er of this type at their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ ores , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles were rapidly mobili@@ zing against the ship . they refused to tap one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fishing agency . he is part of a team that discovered and watched the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million to Liberia , due to lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was founded by F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal fishing ( stop Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are the six countries in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , who then expelled the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and help each other where it is about illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , leader of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can damage ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate equilibrium .
but while action against illegal fishing was once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the au@@ ger emp@@ o , with information between individual countries , the actions happen nowadays in real time , with trace@@ able on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses for example , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one notices or experienced during port inspection .
fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas , such as those that suggest that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show if the involved vessels have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly also if they have a criminal code .
on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports . which means that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated $ 20 million lost revenue , which the eight members of H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lost each year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , fake roy@@ alties , speci@@ fying fantasi@@ es , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ complete organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now .
until now , the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 tests of suspi@@ cious ships .
it uncovered criminal networks that had distributed bog@@ us licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for the fight against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track down the illegal ships they like to hide .
&quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support .
some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , for example , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine protection organization : a platform that provides satellite data and displays the position of every single track@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what is happening - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them .
ships that used to confis@@ cate without a license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences now know they will be observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have meanwhile recorded a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there tra@@ w@@ l nets where their use was banned .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
other countries are also notic@@ ing these successes . &quot; the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing .
six countries have joined forces there in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With certainty , the aim is to develop even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member of Somalia had its first big triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under false flag . and not only was the ship on the road without a license and were used drag nets which are now prohibited .
the ship was also penet@@ rated into prohibited waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works across the world .

their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is escal@@ ating : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ turing &quot; the country &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

following the rejection of the opposition to a referendum on the removal of the opposition , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in their eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country running through the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the retreat of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country , including the Bar@@ inas low@@ land area , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , located in the central north @-@ east of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is worsen@@ ing , which is reflected in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many of the opposition &apos;s representatives saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the removal of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro ; in the end , however , the position of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ ari@@ zes the context of the government decision as follows :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and profits are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which there is a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum on office resolution was the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly on 27 October .
the call was commented on Twitter , among others as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday country @-@ wide civil strike and on November 3rd all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
the first demonstration in the framework of the programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 .
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify , among other things , an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most shared images shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , pictures eman@@ ating from confron@@ tations and reports of oppression and abuse are accum@@ ulating .
especially large waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own testimony from the police and the armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round that forms the amount of suppression a day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial exercise procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many people by the presence of countless people on the streets .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published with friendly permission .
when he was 15 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city Cór@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano is now in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Cordoba against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , was committed to crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years , he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time I thought that it was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 , one does not realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not see at that time that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer , and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ man . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was the deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a ten @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ o &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy and who , in front of a federal court , testified against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from sports hall to military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my boy@@ friend on that .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you are friends with one of the ERP friends .
don &apos;t forget that they don &apos;t have to kid@@ nap you one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian revolutionary workers &quot; party .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told me I would become a secret agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
at the base of the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&quot; over there the prisoners are tortured &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me for the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
all of this was stolen .
he gave me a little bell wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were stopped and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cut in and saw a couch where men were tortured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
they un@@ le@@ ashed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured him out with water and pursued him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals .
photo : Com@@ isi@@ ón Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty wind .
years later when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible for a person to do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and became band@@ ages .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people c@@ rou@@ ched quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I knew that these people were killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it .
apart from La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms which were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero clas@@ h@@ ed and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to testim@@ onies from survivors , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera case , verified the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
when looking at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
if they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; loo@@ t of war &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
at that time at that age I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that one takes away from an enemy that has been fought .

but when one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , record player , clothes , paintings , money ... it &apos;s not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
once he called me a criminal and I answered : and you , who steal the cars on the street ?
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded angry , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you to my own hands .
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do that !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I testified in the process , I showed a photograph of that time on which I wore a jacket and a roll collar pul@@ lover of wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defense was accused of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay my burden on what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the enforced disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abom@@ in@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have children . once you have children , you realize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so you executed people during the dictatorship . but why would the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why kid@@ nap children ?
one day , my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been easy to put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ?
did not these people also have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last horrible act one can do to a human being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; said my father .
but something remains , of course , always .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea to display my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I made him alle@@ gations of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly dis@@ b@@ anded and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian feelings &quot; they supposedly defended were actually good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed men ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he replied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I made the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally declared against my own Father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 counts : severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , torture resulting in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child aged 10 years .

the jud@@ gements in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera case ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims eventually in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court suspended sentence imprisonment and nine cases of prison sentences ranging between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ sentence : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ hol
all the defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silence chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have been working on justice for years for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research for this lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ inian government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a Kyoto centre , where you can extend your driver &apos;s license .
the photo was dissemin@@ ated in the social media .
review of original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving license have witnessed a particularly mis@@ used translation in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was shown on a shield , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
revision of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator , Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which was published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incorrect English translation was first removed . the designation &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture also ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the ap@@ ology as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Japanese online intelligence service J @-@ C@@ ast News talked about the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; fear@@ fully &quot; has been den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers , who are involved in accidents throughout the country , is quite an occasion for concern .
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by senior citizens . this equ@@ ates to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11.@@ 850 crashes .
as a result , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has dropped overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the un@@ named re@@ porter brought comments to light which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently hold against older drivers :
the article on the translation error has , among other things , the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible motor@@ ist &quot; ) about reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So corrupt is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why En@@ gr@@ ish is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real mine for these bizarre errors in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and to use active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be native speakers should not be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .

many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language to translate translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , searching for costs or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
however , some companies that do not have foreign employees allow translations to be made in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose knowledge of English is considered the best , is turned into a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .

machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the conf@@ using and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences that arise by machine translation show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for a few languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints , which often decorate shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .

translation mistakes may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry , but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more resp@@ ectable source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the Internet and TV
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer accessible .
other online stations also recorded footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups opposing the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests started in early April after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was coupled , and recommended using the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : re@@ activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access to Venezu@@ el@@ ans , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media has been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting about protests in 2014 . at that time , the Commission on T@@ elecommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission looked at it as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
it is astonishing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
later on , the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ film@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online stations . this also applies to the Internet site on which the National Assembly delegates its meetings .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique whereby the DNS servers answer requests for certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds poorly or refuses the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was imprisoned .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
he was released eight hours later and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : it is becoming increasingly difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country .

when she was ten years old she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas it is known in Paraguay that more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , more rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , an education and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay for it innumerable days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up .
the practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and condemned .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated with Cri@@ adi@@ tas guarantees silence in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
there is , on the one hand , the family who have their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something different , &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family that assimil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies their exploitation with belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise not receive education and maybe even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in secret societies in Paragu@@ ay@@ an homes , has a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of intense be@@ atings . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military officer Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ e@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra hit Mar@@ ín with a stick until she suffered fatal injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society responsible for the death of the girl .
they referred the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay there are more cows than children registered , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ined .
without documents it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the couple &apos;s neighbors and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the fall .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ e@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
when the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be trend @-@ setting - when the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go arrives in court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as labour , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register bank@@ rupt and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market in order to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she rose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
Fri@@ days , for instance , cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time for learning .
the sooner she was finished with learning , the more leisure she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she didn &apos;t have unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to fetch more books from the library of the house than food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 .
in some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read edi@@ t@@ orials from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince them not to believe the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would meet &quot; bad habits &quot; again . &quot; so they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the Indi@@ genous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would speak their mother tongue to Guar@@ an@@ í again at home .
her masters feared that they would lose the education they had enabled her to lose , she explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , you were fully aware that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken are bul@@ lying and har@@ ass@@ als exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas if they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to go home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Society sanc@@ ti@@ fies the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job ads for cleaning staff and girls in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
start from Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who came also from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the summary of the advertisement laugh@@ ed once more :
dear girl@@ friends , I have found one . I look at whether it works with it .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ do@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies from former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , where the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of the Guar@@ ani had to pay tribute to them and the system of the Mens@@ a ( where the workers as semi @-@ slaves ) were subjected to .
social inequality in Paraguay and that to show power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill ur@@ ges Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations on the use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is adopted by Parliament , users of social media must be registered in Egypt by a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up to permit citizens to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , this could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine .
the bill that consists of six paragra@@ phs and is cur@@ ated in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs on the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration . it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password from the ministry of telecommunications &quot; to come through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . thus , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Chief Research Officer &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter out citizens who are applying for permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor human activities and also to bring them into a trial process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt anything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislature &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his assumption and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in the parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and that there is no visible nar@@ ration on the surface of the picture , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , Euro MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a criminal off@@ ence against cy@@ ber crimin@@ ality in which a life sentence for those convic@@ ted was found guilty of &quot; threatening public order &quot; and &quot; den@@ ying protests . &quot;

this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions .
high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , who travels through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , it is endangered between 800 and 1,000 animals , thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem , &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem will depend on a large predat@@ or .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video finds that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist Raz@@ a likes to show a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
for six years she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and education programs of Nature Iraq .
since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to ensuring that protection zones for wild animals in the region of Kur@@ dist@@ an are set up .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the Nor@@ theast of Japan , documented the progress achieved in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma triggered the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a state pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s nor@@ theastern pre@@ f@@ ecture that had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had left whole coastal cities away from the map .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still had an atomic accident , already because of this alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local point of view , what progress has been made six years after that to rebuild the lives of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and survey results of the affected persons themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare @-@ houses ( the no@@ is@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ u@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to achieve the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed here .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of these houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is at 70 percent the final light .
nevertheless , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ac@@ u ( in the way , cas@@ u@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ch@@ ak@@ u ) , we still endeav@@ our to res@@ ett@@ le into final substitute buildings .
after the triple catastrophe , almost 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people still lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such homes .
almost 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees , who were hau@@ led after the disaster , were reloc@@ ated to final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune had opened their doors to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 per cent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear dis@@ ruption , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has largely recovered , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is still far away .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal dwell@@ ers find it difficult to earn their living .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to obtain an overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ees . she questioned her about the state of reconstruction and how her emp@@ athy has changed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that there is still not enough in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention .
as it is about those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the position of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the mighty earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement buildings .
as of 2017 , there are still 40 000 Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma residents living outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ acu@@ ees , still in shelter , older than 50 years old , are well known because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma will have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 .

when people meet people from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often recognizes that one connects more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives , and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices of Pod@@ cast , we look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by police at nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had taken him against the head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . throughout the country , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active ministry to the conclusion of the incident .
the pictures show the police officer how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer would be beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ro@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in the web , where you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs are brief@@ ing to him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in the social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover a part of the costs of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Or@@ ell@@ ado invites further violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group had joined the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who hit him in the face with a stick .
police en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ments
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
polic@@ emen were sitting at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had set up a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loud@@ speakers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media neglected road protests by directing the focus to another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo pur@@ pos@@ ely reported about a broken glass window in order to design their front pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a set @-@ up bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be acknowledged if one is strictly against any form of material damage .

with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories have closed doors all over Cuba ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular parish Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there are no notable sugar@@ s on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after succ@@ um@@ bing , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the framework of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who is standing at 4 : 00 every day , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which are back in operation after a long in@@ active period because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
it reminds me that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already opposed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for the country some decades ago , but bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically dep@@ rec@@ ated , and hardly competitive , they became unbe@@ atable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar rate rose about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization , according to the 2016 report .
if the current production reached the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the de@@ commissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats is &quot; dec@@ eption . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to arrive .
it was officially written documents which differ@@ ed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the address and the date .
all were signed by Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could authori@@ ze any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was postpon@@ ed and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was in charge of the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mills still in operation , &quot; he affir@@ med .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
against his will he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work station was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president was seeing in the eyes of the people present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories had not been in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for closure of sugar cane mills
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to dict@@ ate it , they also stopped asp@@ hal@@ ing the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with an already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they were replaced with spare parts .
without prospects for the future , many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production is not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to Factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a rent of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month to spend the years in retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies that one told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes to pensions with 65 years old , not because it lacks power , but because it is bitter .

first Nations youths use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture
a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people from the First Nations communities across Canada focus on issues that are important to them . they do so using hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres in 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked with ten C@@ ree @-@ communities in North Que@@ bec and then worked with the C@@ ree hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop concludes that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sums of First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section of road in Western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the theme of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on C@@ ree .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ star Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available as a tran@@ script , as is a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to keep going on my days on earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because as youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
in this way , they can grow and also go ahead of our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator .
in the comments section , readers and advoc@@ ates of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also make a contribution and add the verse to sil@@ o script ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic courts are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic courts ( in the way in the way , in the way of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan , you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
in order to show potential clients , which is exactly on the menu , in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( in the way , &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) are issued by any dish that is served in this restaurant .
the customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ wering district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a multitude of these small companies that manufacture those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic courts are so usual that they do not even notice them . however , a new trend is now turned into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver mat@@ ome the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile tapes decorated with plastic dishes as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were converted to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refrigerator magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food production is becoming more and more complex .
in this case , an Em@@ press @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a cell phone stand .
we have also produced this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple containing your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple with a not@@ ch for your mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some cell phone stands and cell phone designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon ro@@ gues are used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there anybody who would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon @-@ che@@ ated ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think I will be the only one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and rib@@ bons made of dried salmon .
further whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 , which is in the form of the f@@ art .
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic courts are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly only appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the commun@@ es who have learned to live with the pain .
behind every cor@@ pse , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co established the digital project &quot; ap@@ t. a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; live with the drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by traffi@@ ckers and whole communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the P@@ ain of the Vic@@ tims
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a video called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; how Fear Was Chang@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who seeks secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set ourselves to go and look for graves , according to the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 , he left the house .
on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment it doesn &apos;t have any income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my Father , but it won &apos;t pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ plau@@ a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , fra@@ gil@@ ity and leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never look at violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve known disease and sensational journ@@ alism for several years now .
I pass newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel like I am the only person who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different to this or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness , when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
the fu@@ tility of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; rebel@@ li@@ ous . &quot;
I think they are trying to argue that they are spar@@ ed of such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ red and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family was pil@@ la@@ ged with threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals were squee@@ zing money from their business for month , until they had torn apart not only the business , but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain of it never goes , the trauma remains , the fear comes back high when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will take you away or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in these terrible days I asked myself if weeping would resolve my deep @-@ rooted emotions , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The For@@ gotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he says that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , s@@ own potatoes , heat tor@@ till@@ as and make &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with .
when he was five , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was only a couple of blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez was like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of mur@@ ders according to the citizen &apos;s council for public security and government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office counted 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ t. a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking the country has tortured in the last four decades in an intel@@ li@@ gible way .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ MENT : this post and the pages to which he links contain images depicting violence .
the fak@@ ten@@ check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a for@@ gery .
but how is the year after something has emerged for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its initial release , it has been used irre@@ versi@@ bly to cover trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
however , it poses questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tank truck crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped up and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths filled with po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to it .
officials described a fire@@ ball containing dozens of houses including a movie theater nearby , which was full of people watching the FIFA World Cup .
houses burnt and cor@@ ded cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were inc@@ iner@@ ated for recognition .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by the user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horrible scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows series of char@@ red bodies lined up on the floor while people look at it .
but here history does not end its end .
over the years the same photograph was copied several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , comb@@ at@@ ants from B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses repeatedly reported atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one left to count dead bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been sh@@ attered , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be depicted in a figur@@ ative manner .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the B@@ oko Har@@ am attempt to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo again appeared , when it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and potential magnitude of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as evidence for mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely link the picture from DR Congo with sources of mass media to deliver arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash report published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee could kill , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported from the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , who fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an Being said that monks and politicians had participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to cover this information .
the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other intelligence agencies who called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein &apos;s message , but they did not have the picture taken out of DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false coupl@@ ings go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search engine with the search engine Tin@@ ville has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mask of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages including English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ ine@@ ated examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries , based on what page they were published . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than by the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also have been connected to each other ) , several examples of mis@@ use may come from .
here are some cases that can now be fully detected ( on the card in orange ) :
map : news frames .

Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , with one hand expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to timi@@ ze the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being pursued , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Myanmar government published a report on what it , as &quot; inten@@ tional fin@@ ed news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions about Myanmar . &quot;
this judgment , which was exclusively published in English , also includes references to fake images of sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules running H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar thri@@ ce in 2012 that monks and politicians participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of His che@@ ek .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture will continue to contain it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the now deleted Catholic news site An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , expressly stated that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture came into circulation later in connection with the 2015 B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te the fact that there were connections to Nigeria .

the picture of DR Congo has appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre and Charlie Heb@@ do massac@@ res in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to those events that took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the image was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and saved more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages related to it have not been taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam@@ ese , 2014 .
after a message that allegedly was written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it illegal .
from the message in which the image from the DR Congo was contained , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ in@@ mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the gray scale ) , Tin@@ tin also points , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared significantly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture ultimately bears a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
does this mood of mis@@ information and mis@@ information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and complic@@ ates the actual horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the distribution of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equivalent to recogn@@ ising the tragedy . sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern that violent images depic@@ t readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study investig@@ ates how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to debate about violent representations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will need to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be detached from context or completely impro@@ per style .
however , every study of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly any attempt at a simple translation .
a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
the blog contains , for example , words from Van@@ u@@ atu &apos;s Mw@@ ot@@ lap language , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Take care of your parents in recognition of how they have made an effort in your younger years .
words in the H@@ uns@@ et language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after you have been war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and drought catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya come across the shores in 15 bor@@ ou@@ ghs in the south and west of the country .
following an opinion of the disaster center of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly 100 people are missing because of the flood and mud wave .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe locations .
the rainf@@ all continued on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health and hygiene levels of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following images and videos give you an impression of the magnitude of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods are worsen@@ ing the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and further five are made to transport emergency supplies for the villa@@ gers enclosed in their flooded villages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several organisations and startups have also been prepared to help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and nec@@ essi@@ ties of life for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ en@@ ya and Him@@ ann@@ ana .
please call today number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this field .
the taxi @-@ call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks worried people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the disaster center is informed .
last year , after the disaster of the tropical storm of Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me launched a &quot; flood aid &quot; key allowing users to call a vehicle for pick @-@ up assistance and donations .
they also launched a S@@ OS button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped in flood and land@@ slides .
the unified efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need in security and provide help .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , while Sri Lanka &apos;s population is now facing the long road to reg@@ ain@@ ing normal@@ cy .

photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I entr@@ ust her to my four @-@ year @-@ old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last minute we are still calling for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next one , we &apos;re talking about trans@@ gender rights .
we are located in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , bound from an American flag , others sc@@ our slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination .
they dem@@ or@@ alize me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we all are put in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit into it , become Muslim .
to be Muslim
I &apos;m not alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western imagination , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion constitutes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims that have been col@@ oni@@ zing Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing ima@@ gery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should be rescu@@ ed .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid tore the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images continue to prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to do so .
I have been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed fo@@ ols dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries over the past three decades , while the US won &apos;t even elect its first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and Saudi Arabian Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , both of which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ rate weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has cast our collective imagination so deep and fla@@ wed , that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1,7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has f@@ abled failure to grasp the 1.7 billion narrative . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims are the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious groups in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I want to explain that .
I was born as Muslim but to be a Muslim was only then born in my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they resort back to the following terms : belief , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my friend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter when I kept her silent in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arabic verses to the protection which seal the Qur &apos;an and called the q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

affili@@ ation is the picture of my mat@@ ernal grandmother with her sisters ; as she has been able to contest the art of flower arrangements in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their completed and incomplete paintings of painted Su@@ fi saints ; and of a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
being Muslim means to speak the prayers they told me to speak when I have a bad day .
to be a Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation that - over centuries - has been col@@ oni@@ zed by an &quot; Empire , &quot; which a company established with the name of Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ in@@ die Company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author was with her grandfather in 1987 .

belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cries .
in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an insi@@ sted on his family in India @-@ dominated K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close to his arms in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at stake .
to be Muslim is to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed &quot; all up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first pilot &apos;s bomb of history was dropped over a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mir@@ alist subject of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops deployed across every continent , apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy eng@@ ul@@ fs the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first cry of prayer , called Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Mohammed was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ filled the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Musli@@ ma and a journalist , signi@@ fies the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties , with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but fail to communicate it to others .
the narrative of the 1.7 billion offers more possibilities than a cube , but is represented in the reduced branch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot;
being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build on this two @-@ ness structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim registri@@ es , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ Fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we are leading and the bombs we throw on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically incorrect picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 with respect to evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ed to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous ima@@ gery that we are ste@@ aling in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square via black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the internet are now leading the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years before , it had not yet been given ; now they are controlling large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who have made me an un@@ bound Muslim today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things I have left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to &quot; another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations take place within the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not concepts with which we usually throw in our schools around us or that we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I talk about this at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are fought and people are enth@@ ron@@ ed by the work of the &quot; other &quot; in the public idea , was even the science of Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; other &quot; ; just as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president while he already bom@@ bed lands and &quot; to other made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for story@@ telling aims to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , learning stories in their original language is a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices recently reported on another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of large cities .
in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the makers of the project :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that assume diversity - safe spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of listening to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to cher@@ ishing , feeling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers put their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and representation will lead to the audience becoming a@@ dep@@ t .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of Daf@@ ing . during this turn , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the fa@@ bel of rab@@ bits and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened !
they were alert ...
they were with me !
up to now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organisers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling .
Puerto Rico demands US re@@ election of sovereign debt
on 3 April 2017 , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration with the aim of a re @-@ check of the public debt of Puerto Rico . the march started in Cap@@ it@@ ol , the capital of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens front for the ne@@ ural check of debts ) and the ec@@ clesi@@ as@@ tical church meeting Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates for re @-@ fixing the debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico are calling for politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for the debt to be held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed rate of working conditions that acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with sin@@ king reti@@ re@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand immediate
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the island - not the United States &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sovereign territory - is suffering from a severe financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires extensive restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed on the outside are threatened without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration called the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Vi@@ gil for Light and Truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

artists and writers honor the work of the missing Syrian developer Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi
Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi and his wife N@@ our@@ a .
photo from the Facebook page of N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i Saf@@ adi .
the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and family continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , an event was dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director at Book S@@ prints , a publisher of book S@@ prints &apos; finished books within three to five days read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective enquiry ) .
the book published last year and available here roy@@ alty @-@ free contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it pays homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what the real costs are with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was painted out of the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its present state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , and immediately .
seeing Bass@@ el paying a high price for his participation in a free culture has allowed many of us to start thinking about their own fate , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of times of extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken the basis of a command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Long , a designer , techn@@ ologist and , at the moment , the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ que &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pro@@ fan@@ e than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would do everything to extingu@@ ish this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this stri@@ fe in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el has not yet finished conclu@@ ding this project .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am overwhel@@ med when I call His name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he has taught others to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he taught me the internet .
he taught others how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a commission that she wrote to her husband in 2012 @-@ 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together for one year alongside the book .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace ourselves ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I &apos;ll enter into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to cry and smile about your absence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I bear witness that I will return soon ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
one year goes by , my soul
while at the same time
I am in your cage ,
and you &apos;re still in the cage of monsters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history of the Bas@@ sels is not unique in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of force were tortured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in detention in 2016 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do this last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambique : director , convic@@ ted of corruption , returns to previous post
Moz@@ ambique responded with anger to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state machine where corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ o@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 , together with four other defend@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years in prison for the im@@ pover@@ ishment of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose Council presi@@ ded over Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for its rein@@ statement to the company , which took place on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post , as the company did not conduct disciplinary proceedings after its detention .
however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , in an interview with Deutsche Welle condemned the company &apos;s decision to put the director again :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step back in terms of the efforts of our legal system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also have in@@ stituted a disciplinary procedure against the act of re@@ fut@@ ation .
the company , however , apparently kept silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would have been advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been served .
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will be happy to pay for his silence .
ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director has no mor@@ als :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ts him . I can &apos;t believe that you are rewarded by such a way that has insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing the morality and serves the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served himself only by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man , who was pre@@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ n prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is in jail :
thi@@ eves are in prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only remain in memory of the Moz@@ am@@ ic@@ ans as the first independent president , but also as sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral representations , when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that he is not like that . he changes the tactics but he doesn &apos;t turn from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also negative :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 10 years and was released . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spi@@ der b@@ ins .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts out of the network , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still deb@@ ated about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ectives &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely aber@@ rant con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been cens@@ ored for its use .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same sequence of letters as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese as &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spi@@ der b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way to know if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the proposition ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there have been several reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is of the opinion that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it eradic@@ ates all posts that are suspected of racism .
Facebook doesn &apos;t delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write about fac@@ t@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words that are standing next .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( stool ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech have received quite a good lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is time to circumc@@ ise her nation@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who propag@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or alternative way of writing the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from Facebook for 24 hours because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a number of posts from people who have no negative intent or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech removed from Facebook .
in the post the author shared his view of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throne &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook cens@@ orship has caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun of Facebook and consciously writing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken off the grid .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that did not include hate speech , but were removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is intended to heat violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for failing to take control of the powerful hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at initiatives rather than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago ends with the to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .

the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament voted unanim@@ ously on a law to ban this practice , so that the age @-@ ready age is now 18 .
before this change of the law some members adher@@ ed to the practice of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities , and in May 2016 there was a great public cry . at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups in the country , said that the state should not interfere because that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
this was not@@ withstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contracting partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights , the min@@ ors as , each person under 18 years of age . &quot;
UN statistics for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which ende@@ a@@ vor@@ ed to abol@@ ish laws for children &apos;s to@@ e , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
but not everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , dam@@ n , take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this sort of religious opposition ensured tension in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point there arose doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the bill of law at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the to@@ e @-@ marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who ab@@ stained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the marriage of children was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no one decided against it .
after having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users was enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws on children &apos;s marriage had finally been changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which has covered the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost any price .
while Abel was the opinion of Abel , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al@@ - Thomas , stating : , Excell@@ ent news !
the law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who was quite openly discussing how important the adoption of the law said :
the age @-@ ready age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft to am@@ end the marriage was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties and 35 of them were present in the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties who were present have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the to@@ e is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ birth ag@@ ei@@ evi@@ den@@ abuse .
many thanks to all activists who have challenged him .
con@@ gr@@ ats . congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s most famous Hind@@ u organization .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention of taking into court steps should the law be adopted , and he seems to deliver his promise now .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wishes to proceed against the law , most social media users desired that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ m@@ ack@@ l suggested :
rather , instead of talking about the problem , rather than talking about the problem that the state , our daughters , protects it from being mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in favour of them , would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a law@@ suit against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children are legally or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , even though there are laws which they prohi@@ bit .

by mirr@@ oring Web sites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented internationally in contrast to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States on January 18 , 2012 .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey is blocking the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series fight against the lock .
although many tech sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using ren@@ ding tools for blocked websites ( a current article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia for 2008 , as recently described in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular blocking of the Internet has been taking place since 2007 after the internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked there are now several mirror sites ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ plant@@ ation File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. machine host connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is , in spite of legal prohibition , available .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the locking of Wikipedia ) , we put all the snap@@ shots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the contents in a de@@ centralized and distributed fashion .
this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was done independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no li@@ ve@@ - or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ny of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites if Wikipedia is locked in the respective country .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices and co @-@ workers at Moz@@ illa at the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
one acc@@ esses another URL that is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server guides the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia , if they are closed in Turkey .
for this is done by a server not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature protection
a su@@ sten@@ ance of N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with badly positioned motifs and balanced colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s animal world to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that attract attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when I suddenly called to Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river @-@ dam is only a few minutes from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to bend my pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to co @-@ operate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he already stood face to face with tig@@ ers :
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b himself by the opinion of the sheep not when sleeping ! !
late at night . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the boy appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for all &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , mostly living in a tent in order to take pictures of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to say the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India .
a revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid the utmost care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a was convic@@ ted by a fic@@ tional court and rejected by her family and the community after having contacted a married relative with name .
the tradition of not nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer re@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health personnel as well as house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main ador@@ n@@ ment of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the Camp@@ a@@ ign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al that is operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and is committed to the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine has been working for seven years using her video camera to detect practices such as child@@ marriage up to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
it reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors for change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was women who did not call their hus@@ bands name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands out loud is a custom that they all du@@ ti@@ fully uph@@ old and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never known her husband by name , wanted to try at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I should call him hen@@ ce@@ forth by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some thought it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
a woman was so shy that throughout the whole exercise she just ki@@ cked her ; another decided to let the whole fru@@ stration come out against him and his family by cur@@ sing it .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ aline rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put the women in the head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was frigh@@ tened and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation turned out to be violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women have attempted to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ c@@ rose dot on the forehead that shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why do women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ c@@ rose dot if he did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he just laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not completely stopped , but they think they are now in a better position to choose , not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every disc@@ us club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to take care of who could hear what , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so frank@@ ly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to tell certain things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes .
some women in the group have only borne sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to have a Sal@@ em @-@ Kur@@ t , a wide shirt over trousers . they didn &apos;t dare to do so .
after a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes , morality related to sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled her own pair of tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them .
next they decided to take a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it .
on the question as to whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have only made small steps so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of their husband .
some , including me , still do it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of dress - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explained :
each one of us is a victim of patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .
the correspon@@ dents of the video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community come from excluded groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; messages from those who experience it themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and offer a hyper@@ local context to report on global human rights and development challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the people that bald men could be in Moz@@ ambique &apos;s target of attacks .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald individuals for the organ trade , presumably for non @-@ believing purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ lau , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
there are local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a bald man can reveal gold or bring wealth , said the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia di BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of kill@@ ings for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country in 2016 to examine this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
attention to bald men , who travel to Moz@@ ambique , men in Moz@@ ambique are target ritual attacks , the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an police warned against the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ky , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ band Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and assass@@ ination of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ tar@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , this draws the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambique in view ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that there is a faith in which the sacrifices in the head might have power to generate wealth .
in recent days , three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of B@@ log@@ gers &apos; poor S@@ nai@@ ppa on Facebook , suggest@@ ing that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I AM IN Moz@@ ambique , TH@@ AT I AM ashamed One country where people would be ashamed to demand sex against good marks , and take their lives to earn their bread , a land in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed could be hun@@ ted for ab@@ err@@ atic purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; aimed at spe@@ edy riches .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some people could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humour .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and thrilled Twitter users , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district of Mor@@ tar@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald @-@ headed :
the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an authorities are very concerned about the mur@@ ders of bald humans .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply sincere con@@ dol@@ ences against his family , his friends and all those who have known him and loved him .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in our Arab blo@@ gger meeting in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ sels wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who spend themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that her husband had been sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
the residence and the constitution were unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we are especially honored by the work of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations who have been campaig@@ ning for their release over the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the start of protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have van@@ ished , the Syrian Network for Human Rights organization .
countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly disappeared by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custody , the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winner and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably only recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state je@@ ure ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ u &apos;s case as &quot; an internal affair , &quot; and said a spokes@@ man , he deemed it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China will continue to receive calls from the international community , Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow him to go abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the stringent treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ arized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations : United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to facilitate treatment abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Bren@@ de have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government told us that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was not able to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China for release Li@@ us , as stated in an explanation on 30 June :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States
ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; wish him the possibility of treatment abroad in so far as it helps him in his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on June 27 that the Embassy of China calls on the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the U.S. Embassy in@@ stituted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and to make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told China that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , which they claim in accordance with the Chinese Constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz also introduced a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can go into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany - United Kingdom
German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hopes that &quot; Li@@ u &quot; gets all the medical support he needs , &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported Reu@@ ters &apos;s news agency that China had great concerns about whether the fuss surrounding Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um invited China to provide li@@ u with appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police have always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues talks :
Canada is calling on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and freedom of engagement for the exercise of these rights .
France - France
France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on June 29 :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and his family are to have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information about whether France would ultimately take it up .
Taiwan and Taiwan
the Council of mainland Affairs in Taiwan asked China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called for China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 and stated that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o who signed Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be regarded as a city .
this remark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city should be considered .
... nobody asked if New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o blog accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we can say that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries , &quot; in view of that , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once one reaches the core of the subject , the good old Ly@@ re emerges from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end , in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , responses to his American guests concerning our press , our Ju@@ dict@@ ative , our political system were truly non @-@ answers .
he disgu@@ ised appropriate questions with non @-@ answers of rational kind .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point , as long as he was paid high in order to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he pointed out concerning the critic@@ isms that one should begin to read the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
when he said that Singapore is more like a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections .
he compared Singapore to cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice has said of Singapore ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard who expected me - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes this , properly associated and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K review de@@ compos@@ es the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committed or was it a Freu@@ dian slip @-@ over ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of Singapore return ?
Singapore is unique , it is both country and city .
since he plays an important role within the cabinet of the government , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do they defend their city but not their country ?
who has to pay our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink staff expansion ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade dates back to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proposition seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that &apos;s not right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .

screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is the most mis@@ understood aspect in your home or home country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series to reveal ru@@ mo@@ urs about certain parts of the world and to show another fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question I asked most about in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is deemed to be pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook inside rage when they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bother me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know each other , there is little that makes Canadi@@ ans different from us .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it was already when I began travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare system !
we don &apos;t have any weapons !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant of ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter if you would switch to Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice &quot; is basically to be fun - like the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle yet tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian double @-@ lon@@ er ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing at which you can stum@@ ble .
being harmless means being un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not worthy of attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay in the background un@@ noticed , far away from things happening around you .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major characteristic of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice , &quot; perhaps simply cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence along the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ ens Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dies the Jun@@ ta , who took power in 2014 and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Maker describes a young man who tells the rules of his girlfriend .
although not politically , the music video is indirectly related to the Jun@@ ta &apos;s continued military rule .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video relating to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; Chan@@ ges Change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear prec@@ ep@@ ts are often used by the authorities to arrest milit@@ ants and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unity was set up in the army that monitors online content and accused persons accused of being slan@@ dered by the monarchy .
Thailand uses a strict law against &quot; Read Maj@@ esty &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat of the army .
one of the problems the Jun@@ ta remains pursuing is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , even though security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in jail , because they are supposed to have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the band showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The tribute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 .

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society only slowly re@@ covers in East @-@ Asia Min@@ or , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ astic war officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ les are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Dep@@ u@@ as , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10,000 people here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after having barely climbed over a decade .
about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district in 1989 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey housing blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ to@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are decay and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts talking and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of whom served the community .
now there is only paved road with obstruc@@ ted magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have left the district in the meantime .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ to@@ kas , which can accommodate one or two families , can be seen at the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a ruined house .
when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to be photographed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the district administration provides for free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we &apos;ll build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
in spite of her el@@ dest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave her before Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she instead supports her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she calls her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ asha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day , it reminds of the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha holds approximately $ 9 child benefits for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time it lost its anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right to them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day as the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation tends to end , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they walk , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood who cares about their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Afrika &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is home to migrants on their long journey . &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez launches a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and golden earrings in ted@@ dy bear shape .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,@@ 50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , tells Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come to full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you in Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and gets them to the hospital when they are ill , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they can &apos;t pay , she mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gurt beard ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil hoping to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel very comfortable here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao leaves with his sister hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans already speak about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at M@@ om Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her that her guests often send word messages when they went away to greet her or to tell her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken up migrants in their small home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a hob outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people will help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
having lived there for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site .
the majority of migrants coming through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to extract money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single mother , offered him her roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is again full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , the travellers should consult their phones easily .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who went away .
like a proud grandmother she leaves in her album with a lot of photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair spots she has made her an Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , young and old .
she laughs sadly while she briefly introduces her to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities area in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city of U@@ rum@@ qi received a mobile phone notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities should also use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police reported that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gen &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans , and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can , of course , be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while messages on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ orship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the media @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( Spain ) , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police officers in@@ discrimin@@ ately examined the residents whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ano ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they may be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use appliances designed for elderly people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( Spain ) , as well as a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , indicating that the software can lift the password request from a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and institutions associated with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices .
an up @-@ to @-@ date report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also allu@@ ded to these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media storage cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of U@@ rum@@ qi &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pun@@ ishments for a number of other possible violations , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cries out after death
a sol@@ itary cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world , you are looking at and finding that you are all alone in a place where all the important things have van@@ ished .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable from inside as well as from the outside .
one that ren@@ ders all honor to their name .
one who has dropped into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when the reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters transform themselves into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries out after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even if the earth moves on the axis of the un@@ holy . you realize that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security minister put it , with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn away from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds .
it was enough for the city to cr@@ ush the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; cries .
all the districts cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time even if I had no high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
during the third night , things had cal@@ med down after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning .
I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice echo through silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a gorgeous image that filled my expectations completely and completely .
in such a moment , you become aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the slightest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice , after you cried out the whole way to the Security Service &apos;s office .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me hear how you write &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were upon me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you trust me to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was due to my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure of my thing when I answered : &quot; I hadn &apos;t thought you had forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking into my eyes , so why should I do it right now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary and his father straight away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the smell of this accur@@ sed sentence is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stepped through the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I present all details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably allocated a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share it with just one more prisoner and let me sit immediately without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : beating the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ ä@@ ft@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after hes@@ itating hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells lay a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no distinctive facial features can be seen in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him when I stay .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive away all these crow@@ s , which grow on the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries are heard , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of cal@@ am@@ ity until I saw the yellow light , which presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; allu@@ rement to 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are here to hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : in order to protect the state security against us and prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al press card and betra@@ yed the close vision of their world view .
this is not a house , this is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me so .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say more exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice told me that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to make this penalty .
of punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe which probably comes from the clo@@ aca .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you can &apos;t with@@ hold your scre@@ ams .
my scre@@ ams did not yet confess to him , which is why they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a collector &apos;s collector , or if it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped shou@@ ting .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cool down and didn &apos;t really enjoy it , which is why he picked up an electrically charged rod .
electricity f@@ lowed all my body , enough to feed my entire neighborhood .
my half naked body lying on the ground was the perfect electric conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which occurred to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ rage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father needs to worry terri@@ bly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and keep away , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ bar@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he s@@ lows down to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and also to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ stained lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as rock ye@@ asts ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and scrut@@ ini@@ zes their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed music .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all of these topics are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ise with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special a@@ version to the American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , have something to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian wing of the second generation , &quot; he calls himself , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; while he pour into water dissolved Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot June day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the gap of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ats of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose speak first and foremost of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you look at the neighboring countries .
therefore , it is easy to avoid doing basic things - as in public during Ram@@ adan drinking water - in order not to land in prison .
recently the Interior Ministry announced an appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic promotion front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ ri@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had just been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which in@@ jects the old @-@ proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the whole region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to stand up for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b re@@ pressed traditional gender norms by educ@@ ating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently low @-@ tro@@ dden unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
over the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &quot; Hon@@ orary mor@@ als &quot; - the un@@ official fron@@ tiers .
human Rights Watch , according to Human Rights Watch , reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have been victims of mur@@ ders or domestic violence .
according to a 1954 anti @-@ crime legislation , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; in@@ definitely be imprisoned in prison , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures and the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from subjects that long considered to be t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit allu@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and freedom of expression , not from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was fed up with politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ or@@ ano . &quot;
in this song one verse often repe@@ ats itself quite often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or not faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan is talking about the rights of gay and les@@ bians , and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to see later that his comments were torn from context , distorted and in his opinion cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed up only a modified version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not dis@@ agree with Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in his memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ alle , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new any more that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
more recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service noted several former members of the government and members of the Te@@ ach@@ ers &apos; Association , argu@@ ing that they were critical of the problems associated with the corruption that was deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s how it looks like H@@ da@@ i@@ b - is made up of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ ficially induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one assumes that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the solid cars , drums and dancing have been handed over for over a thousand years and come from a time when armies mar@@ ched from the west of Japan to the northeast to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how large these parts are ...
a community center in the capital , Meg@@ uro @-@ Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro @-@ Ga@@ yo@@ en for a long time : two solid cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend their summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ meter @-@ tall car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ ans swap arms against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

rarely , external appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian young out of crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend , appearance , and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
experts compete against each other in order to show who can create the most exact looks , as can be seen in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
education institutions such as Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , have an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to obtain a training in the art of hair@@ dressing , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of youngsters have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its achievements :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built up this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : letter of Love to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; love messages to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the post will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it even more important to meet people who feel dis@@ cour@@ aged ?
this is precisely the question of Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga , young Colum@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired her to write letters to the Cart@@ a p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
only recently , their country was the setting of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos for his mer@@ its received the Nobel Peace Prize .
before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ erri@@ ll@@ as who have lived in illegal camps for many years , subjected to war rhet@@ oric and carrying their weapons around the clock must now return to life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases , accustomed to deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take it into its ranks and support them in the creation of a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colum@@ bians would join together and help in the integration process .
and exactly that they did : so far , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as Inspiration for the Camp@@ a@@ ign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those they need much more .
he was planning to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response .
so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC fighters that will now find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC acted as they had done before to counter@@ act the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut where the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because beside him there was a M@@ GL gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone has written something such a beautiful thing , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I embra@@ ced him completely and sat down beside the gar@@ net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps he was tired of war , but he was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life as a war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that outside there is a society waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I just learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now that peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC have joined a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in hiding .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have witnessed the social injustice on the part of the State to the whole of the Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
listening to these people , who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated them were only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it comforts me that all men , including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and embrace .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
Colom@@ bians were told that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to resort to arms , raise up and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now put on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
in horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which hangs above the LG@@ BT@@ Q community in the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community , did not come into being until night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published showing the deportation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood she felt that she was in reality a woman .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned about the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
for fear of her life , she eventually moved to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer worker in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate that shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos from my documents made the rounds through the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was just about to pop out a few shopping bags from the seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you cry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
apparently , some women had received everything and started shou@@ ting .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung mu@@ le .
OC Media : in which cases were you laid - in which of the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for treating me with respect .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last February I received threats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they posed absurd demands : some told me I had to prove it by walking up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just bad speech , and Phot@@ os@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people once talked to my mother in the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , which has humili@@ ated not only your family but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck .
fortunately , the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window there stood a car with dark window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten .
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not grasp how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it without registering without identification , without knowing anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
came and checked in at the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe you are in security , just because you have left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : do you still have contact with your family ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : just with my mother and sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o theme .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this psychological barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who stayed dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to someone who has spent one and a half months in her gun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he told us that during Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not finish a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
in this way I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood grati@@ fication .
OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there &apos;s just not so many .
if , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ all they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and say they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
since then there has been nothing new from them .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person himself was there when these people were taken .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports yet . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why otherwise wouldn &apos;t they have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that already before 2003 I was already known in Gros@@ ny when I was living there - and I never had any problems .
seriously !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to introduce us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately forced us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had coloured eyel@@ ashes , wearing tubes jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria never bent my hair down .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ are not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to be children if they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they closed their eyes in front of you because they thought you were ill ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped up to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about mor@@ als on television .
he did not talk about us per se , but above all about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could sense how people began to change in the city .
he who smil@@ ed before and laugh@@ ed at once looked at you with suspicion .
in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation worsen@@ ed in the republic .
OC Media : what activities are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the United States .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise tea bags , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t have a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I ap@@ plau@@ ded refuge .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
nature has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth that there are no ga@@ ys .
the D@@ age@@ stan@@ i have those who have Kab@@ ard@@ ino , the Russians also have ; on the whole planet they are - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan , live together with men .
know , many think at Transi@@ ent to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different life settings .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
there has been a sharp increase in suicide since the last few months .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ asi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 re@@ marked the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability of his family to arise , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn &apos;t do anything anymore .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority in August , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hang@@ ed .
their stories have one thing in common : it was all family fathers who were hel@@ pless and unable to eat their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffers from poverty , unemployment and discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and in 1925 saw great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable utility areas for Iranian farming .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth .
it is often a victim of ill @-@ treated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs to work in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s that diver@@ t water from the Arab areas to the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the rate of unemployment among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi adolescents rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Administrator @-@ General for Co@@ operatives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist resi@@ ding in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since function@@ aries and institutions don &apos;t prefer to recru@@ it Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and comp@@ el them to earn their living outside their home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first name and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and thus be employed , as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speaking Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes .
in view of the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi , human rights activists are aler@@ ting alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t I identify femin@@ ism with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put through well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be feminine in general .
for example , women today still earn less money than men despite the same education .
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come across a glass ceiling before or later in various spheres of life , and that discrimination on grounds of sex is still moving across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to skin colour , on racism , on black women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used with racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and out of the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices &quot; and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alised form of racial @-@ motivated violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often directed to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of all skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands who refuses to take into account im@@ perfec@@ tions in her thinking , which relate both to the sex and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a dre@@ ad@@ ful and margin@@ alised being in historical terms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ lap skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement tot@@ aling silence no matter how many black women are trying to teach them a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different income a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white Femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still lies in its name .
I prefer to dis@@ soci@@ ate myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of wom@@ an@@ ism that has been established for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than advoc@@ ating for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we have black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ uni@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and can be worshipped in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist .
because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman , I am recognized as part of this paradigm .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life is neither ski@@ pped nor ignored .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be re@@ published here .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a has travelled again and again in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a special concern by the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ lo@@ Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ Based Alliance that uses and works to protect rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a single question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and released by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; from structural issues . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # gra@@ vit@@ ein@@ ef@@ rie@@ ure ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect affected persons .
a police inspec@@ tor told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had been violent towards her .
since the end of their relationship some time has gone by and the police said their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done .
when another wife of Bal@@ bu@@ ena was shown due to abuse , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s informed ad was also useless .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her display .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women ever submit an advertisement at all , they generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence should report at all to the law enforcement agencies .
contents 1 Be@@ blows and Statisti@@ cs 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that has nothing sub@@ merged to Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , poor implementation impacts and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studio , a social science research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports , which do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available numbers are , however , al@@ arming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney General opened 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the advertisements in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 indications of domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of women were reported here .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; for every woman who reports in Paraguay due to psychological abuse , there are 9 women who do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who cannot do this because of physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since there is no criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , the law enforcement authorities cannot document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists count at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estim@@ ations , in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violent acts by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then gave up . this should always regret her .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos . but for two years she wore psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the ill treatment by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people answered their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had so long enjoyed Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , spent nearly eight years fighting with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner ab@@ used them .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the testim@@ onies of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities stayed without result and also from their relatives , they received no support .
she took a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , mainly for money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a Bill of Law was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Port Ell@@ as ( # Prince ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the motion # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ natives ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law fores@@ ees that fem@@ ini@@ d must be declared a criminal off@@ ender and to punish har@@ sh@@ er as it is the case in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the text was changed in some respects , in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is banned , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years in prison .
the original draft law had envis@@ aged that the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence must themselves bear on their own if they simply want to report an advertisement and receive a secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter @-@ human relationships .
here a re@@ think must take place so that violence is no longer considered a normal thing .
who is silent in the face of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators get out of their way .
we must report as long as abuse is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been modified , including a passage that the partners had called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a major set@@ back .

independent media continues to attack in Oman one year after b@@ anning a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the home page of the banned paper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the om@@ anic authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their coverage of corruption in the sul@@ tant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he is serving a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial , but later returned .
Oman has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after serving his father , S@@ aid bin Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , he has held the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of the Sul@@ t@@ ans is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic secret services , restric@@ ting public fre@@ edoms , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting and det@@ ecting human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists .
the authorities systematically restrict human rights to peaceful and legitimate activities and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in public authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its foundation in 2007 , corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces seized I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , after an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of having placed pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a ruling in a dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the head@@ line : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was charged before the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS drew the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper on any way , including online , is prohibited from August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of dis@@ ruption of public order , abuse of the Internet , and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years &quot; imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3000 om@@ ani@@ ac ri@@ al each ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year prohibition against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a b@@ ail was set at the height of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 before the Jud@@ gment .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his 6 @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he is serving his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to include the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper still faces attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re @-@ introduce the publication of the newspaper .
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated in Oman recently .
other violations include , for example , the closure of the site of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper , to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the om@@ anic authorities :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ fet@@ tered their rights to human rights and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association and the right to gather , support and protect themselves peac@@ efully .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for locally carried out medical research : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the particular medical needs on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious effects in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , the research conducted by African scientists is helping to build its own research capacities in Africa . a larger role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched himself on the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national programme of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I have just launched a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens .
GV : what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always stay on the receiver rather than being a maker yourself .
the solutions we get are often not applicable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what &apos;s the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic education , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here .
the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that talks about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 grades , such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for nearly 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding .
the patents are not only applied to individual types , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more of these patents have been applied to more and more plants , such as cer@@ eal or car@@ rots . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton still breeds salad , but in the meantime he needs longer because his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if there is a b@@ oul@@ der in a river to whom I have to p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far on salads .
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of let@@ tu@@ ce because all the features are already patented . &quot; so he continues to do as best as possible and tries to breed those traits that he wants .
however , it is very cau@@ tious and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also joined a movement that will become ever greater in the USA and all over the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red red let@@ tu@@ ce of the variety Out@@ ra@@ geous in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station and ate . there , it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be permanently usable for plant breeders .
in the context of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit themselves to freely use the seeds bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who purchase their seeds to breed their own varieties and do not cut it out immediately - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
som@@ ber prospects
for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seed and the ability to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds therefore play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not occupied with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , &quot; he says and takes on the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , whose recent examples are the combinations of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Bayer , which are offered in August and September 2016 . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to freely distribute their seeds , as opposed to patent seed and plant traits .

O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights available on plant material that is becoming more and more restricted .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all the cart@@ on characteristics are protected as intellectual property , making it impossible for plant breeders to be usable either at all or only makes it more difficult to use .
for other plants such estimates do not exist yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat in even greater style are patented than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are grown in such a way that they exhibit desirable traits - from those by which their taste or colour is improved to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and resist threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much less predictable .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowled@@ ges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Ministry of Agriculture , the company is committed to preserving the genetic diversity .
however , it contradic@@ ts the belief that intellectual property includes other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent exp@@ ires .
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
such protection does not prevent innovation , but fo@@ sters them by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees it differently : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ els , certainly does not promote innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to breed to plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight .
however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders do not have time or money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us if we can &apos;t continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ton is interfer@@ ing with the concept of using plant features : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form it themselves and as a bree@@ der we have no idea how the plants do it .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeders in the US state of Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a breed also bred their own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures whose cultivation requires mass @-@ based her@@ bi@@ cides , cultiv@@ ates into its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly contrary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .

Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties for a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you have been protected for 20 years in front of competition , which makes it very easy in my opinion . &quot;
while the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept now spreads quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources , runs a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an open @-@ source licence , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i commitment to breeders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation can not easily be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the European Commission &apos;s executive committee , the European Commission , stated that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able , thus addressing the current practice of the European Patent Office which permits patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is still not a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed pat@@ enting .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s &quot; Open Source &quot; seed system , states that the organization is currently building a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which the official launch should fall for the next year .
an association of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report . it believes that farmers must have the opportunity to come to seeds , to exchange ideas and to improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon recognise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has particularly taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest objectives of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock contents on the Internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organization and blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of May 5th , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports them above .
in August the network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities strongly critic@@ ised this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains unchanged in spite of this attack and the mo@@ cking of Egyptian rights and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law and to give victims a voice . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network from Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : first human rights organization has fallen victim to the wave of web sites . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main sources of human rights in the Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer has access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of columns and articles , which he writes for websites and media not accessible in Egypt .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government &apos;s cens@@ orship was even the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider that is also home to the Zi@@ adas blog , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , reporting on the student protests and recording a video like the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment Zi@@ ada spoke about the government &apos;s block@@ age and reflected what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi ; and although the blo@@ gging of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) I managed to convey the feeling of a state of siege ; arrest , attempted murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the blo@@ gging blo@@ gs and any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
now , however , after they have blocked it and that they are scar@@ ed of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked out 133 pages from May 24 to August 6 . these resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
it also documented the locking of vendors , which enabled Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the locking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such a practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering the content that the Egyptian users might have access to .
the situation is also worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis to proceed against these actions in court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are quar@@ r@@ elling .

day after day newspapers in Brazil report with dark slo@@ gans from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of many postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old killed in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rough pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers to the army , na@@ vy and air port to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brazilian Non Govern@@ mental Organization Global Justice has even called on the United Nations to intervene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
the newspaper &quot; Extra , &quot; known for detailed reporting on violence in Rio on 16 August , published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced to set up a new column called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now being published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper this way :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the paper , stated that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a martial bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognise the war at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same video , a journalist in the newspaper states that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write :
we are aware that a war discourse , if distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police that first shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; damage more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to accoun@@ table officials responsible for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public services .
as a reminder , Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

lab@@ eling Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , according to the statistics of 2015 , 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and north @-@ east of the country .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the moral rates per federal state , Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia emphasizes , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
the creation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , was one of these security policy measures aimed at capturing a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police commandment and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this led to a decrease in violent deaths . however , after several reports , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria set by the Geneva Convention - the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for people .
this requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one week it is now that the police om@@ itted the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ et@@ zin@@ ho in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ res@@ eller died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ ck
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal backing and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to wins Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b in a state of siege .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these areas controlled by rebels have been besieg@@ ed outside Damascus , which resulted in inhabitants being dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points .
through years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian Hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics are teaching the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a life @-@ saving food source .
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ ison and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fungi do not belong to the conventional food grown in Syria and are only very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said against the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided for the cultivation of mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known , and expressed his reli@@ ance on gaining popularity . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do is used in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ ison .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the planting of mushrooms , according to Dr. Lei@@ la at Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of about € 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the shortage of fuel , locally produced plastic fuel is used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds from the regions , &quot; before they checked their quality and , if they were suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they have created a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ al breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and the siege becomes visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government called for a state shower last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cian region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
all Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017

numerous videos spread across the web and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the Se@@ ek@@ able Trage@@ dy
the aim of Saturday &apos;s protests was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to contain the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads closed by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened in June as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with a high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for the shape of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity to fall if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val goes on in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of slightly inflamm@@ able wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , always spread further to the fires of this species .
these problems add to the fact that Portugal &apos;s Civil Defence web site on 15 and 16 October , when residents were seeking information or trying to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : it took advantage of its own civil protection data using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire department and was so decisive on this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the site was more than half a million people .
even the founder asked for help :

two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair .
exactly at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belonged to the ethnic group of the Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother did not say that at that time , she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more .
at dawn , the boy was to break .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been killed by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt uns@@ ett@@ led .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af recovered in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged bags with mort@@ ars that were heavier than he himself to make a living .
back then , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked .
there were no services and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows to avoid freezing at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and landed on a small un@@ inhabited island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his request for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid people twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high expectations , Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers . it is true , however , that the conditions prevailing in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Human Rights Organization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3,000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a recording centre if they officially filed an application for asylum - which can still be delayed for months after the asylum application has been registered .
until then people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was A@@ shar@@ af .
but his irre@@ pres@@ sible li@@ festy@@ les helped A@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions .
after having worked for several years in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af was able to put all of his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this worked so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Succ@@ ess Story is now the subject of documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di &apos;s director .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the road to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ an @-@ owned companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants have emerged .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals reach far beyond the Italian gastronomy sector and retail , and aim to reach the country which he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are opportunities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces in the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also creates plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this road .
citizen report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt enable shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , in custody for more than 900 days .
he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the removal of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ate &apos;s ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft law stating that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government agency .
users would have to register to use social networks within six months of submitting their full name and identification number within six months of submitting their full name and identity .
those who neglect this step could be sentenced to up to six months &quot; imprisonment or the tri@@ bun@@ als of a criminal off@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law , which was applied by 60 members of parliament , is currently before legislative and constitutional committees of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in May , another member of the Parliament sent a legislative proposal to introduce stric@@ ter sanctions for the insul@@ t of the President or a high ranking official .
under the law , such an act would , however , be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is to be passed , this can mean three years &quot; imprisonment for the convic@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , this would support a political climate in which freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed the demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 participants , who were arrested at the same incident , four years in prison for a date of trial .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison leadership failed due to human rights groups to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threatened the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , pseu@@ do @-@ possession of , among other things , weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal tribunal in G@@ iza opened the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
interro@@ gations of Tunisi@@ an activists on secured documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ ath and the Global Vo@@ ices advoc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been largely interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft law that would ensure officers and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption official am@@ nesty , provided they return all un@@ lawful funds .
the document published on the Na@@ wa@@ ath website on April 21 th@@ rows a light on how the presidential plans appear to support the bill .
Ben @-@ G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources stating the provisions of Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press of the press , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case .
will China force users of social media to submit their identification ?
according to the new regulations of the Government Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the provisions , it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts believe that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ comp@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the Land government as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of information distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this term is part of a law in 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government leads a list of online services that &quot; organize &quot; the publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make use of said services for the removal of content and to force it on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites are currently websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ Fili@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has locking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the locking of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators have refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications announced that the site had been blocked because it became &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups in order to insti@@ gate a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , in addition to China , one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ling
following this week , the UK government is in the midst of a deliber@@ ate consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor @-@ Progra@@ ms to de@@ code data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies regarding the proposal but has left other technology companies and the civilian population out@@ war@@ dly .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
