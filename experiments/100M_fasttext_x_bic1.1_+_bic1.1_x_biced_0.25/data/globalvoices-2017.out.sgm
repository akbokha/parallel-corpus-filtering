<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time now.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and used his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">When I was 14, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter, who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnate, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "free according to Method Man," "" "" "" "It was me, as if it is absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only intensified my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never thinks behind the mountain as they say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in favor of him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in Republican elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which receives people from all over the world, a deeply believer person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trump didn't agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">In contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights the environment for her life and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wiser advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump behaved his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, would they say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "whitelash" (note. O.B.): as much as white against all other ethnic groups. "white in allurement to the whites and whiplash, which means so much like whiplash injuries), as the big Van Jones described, killed exactly what America did so splendidly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which beliefs or background you may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyaneer, whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trump, however, there is a huge part of the White America that promises this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "" "" "no!" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "do Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no!" "" "" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no!" "" "" "" "they cried and their voices were louder." "" ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if someone who is not like you would have a place in your America?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, that's not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now called Trump Country, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could no longer find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero Community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan town of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places has changed not only the life of the children but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is on the edge of a large landfills, just 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular with tourists, but worlds apart from nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which, with their musical instruments, has found a way to overcome poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its abuse of drugs and bananas.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare hope for the young.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, timpani, bongos and the Conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest landfill of Asuncion in Paraguayan capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with instruments made up of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to transform parts of the decay into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all made of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in rubbish. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a rubbish made violin." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made up of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "a documentation called" "" "" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "" "" "records the musical performance:" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports specifically about international, practiced solutions for environmental issues.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a lawbreaker of this type at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobilizing against the ship. they refused to tap one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permits.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "suddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "" "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fishing agency. he is part of a team that discovered and watched the ship at that time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay $2 million to Liberia, due to looting the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was founded by FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal fishing (stop Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are the six countries in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, who then expelled the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and help each other where it is about illegal fishing," says Tony Long, leader of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can damage ecosystems that have a delicate equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while action against illegal fishing was once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the auger empo, with information between individual countries, the actions happen nowadays in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses for example, news about suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas, such as those that suggest that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show if the involved vessels have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly also if they have a criminal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">On the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports. which means that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "" "" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "" "" "says Per Erik Bergh, Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated $20 million lost revenue, which the eight members of HISH-i network lost each year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, fake royalties, specifying fantasies, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-complete organized control system," "" "" "" "Long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 tests of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It uncovered criminal networks that had distributed bogus licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into networks of organized crime," "" "" "" "says Bergh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track down the illegal ships they like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position. and that's what we try to cross," says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems, for example, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform with Google and the Oceana marine protection organization: a platform that provides satellite data and displays the position of every single trackable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what is happening - that simply makes sense," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources for investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "" "" "we should do this at a global level." "" "" "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to confiscate without a license and hardly had to reckon with consequences now know they will be observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile recorded a 33% increase in fishery sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track down Greko 1, the inspectors found there trawl nets where their use was banned.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries are also noticing these successes. "the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries," says Kiilu. "we are a study object." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">Six countries have joined forces there in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i. "" With certainty, the aim is to develop even more such initiatives and structures in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member of Somalia had its first big triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship sailing under false flag. and not only was the ship on the road without a license and were used drag nets which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also penetrated into prohibited waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" by taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works across the world.

<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country, including the Barinas lowland area, in the Andes regions Mérida and Táchira, located in the central north-east of Carabobo and at the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>

<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and profits are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which there is a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum on office resolution was the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano is now in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera trial in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, was committed to crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years, he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought that it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15, one does not realize that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not see at that time that my father was a thief, a torturer, and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerman. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was the deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a ten-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijano's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of the atrocities he had experienced as a boy and who, in front of a federal court, testified against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my boyfriend on that.</seg>

<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you are friends with one of the ERP friends.</seg>
<seg id="221">Don't forget that they don't have to kidnap you one day and I have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP is for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Argentinian revolutionary workers "party.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>

<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the base of the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all kinds of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">The first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me for the second time, he commanded me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of this was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little bell wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a large clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were stopped and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>

<seg id="244">Years later when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>

<seg id="250">He spoke to "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also charged in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people lay down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet.</seg>

<seg id="346">Review of original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving license have witnessed a particularly misused translation in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">"" "" "" "the Japanese word" "" "" "" "older drivers" "" "" "" "was shown on a shield, which means" "" "" "" "older drivers" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Revision of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator, Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which was published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "" "" "this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable," "" "" "" "said Holmes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The incorrect English translation was first removed. the designation "terrible drivers" (German: "terrible drivers") was later replaced by the more appropriate designation "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture also apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the apology as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very sorry that older people felt offended by insufficient correction (translation) on our part," "" "" "" "said the police." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="360">Japanese online intelligence service J-Cast News talked about the phenomenon of "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "fearfully" has been denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers, who are involved in accidents throughout the country, is quite an occasion for concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, in 2005 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by senior citizens. this equates to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors caused 1,803 of a total of 11.850 crashes.</seg>
<seg id="364">As a result, their share rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has dropped overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">In the version of the article published on Yahoo, the unnamed reporter brought comments to light which show what prejudices some Japanese apparently hold against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on the translation error has, among other things, the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">"" "" "" "-" "" "" "" "Is this (" "" "" "" "terrible motorist") about reality? "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and to use active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be native speakers should not be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo courtesy of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language to translate translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, searching for costs or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">However, some companies that do not have foreign employees allow translations to be made in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose knowledge of English is considered the best, is turned into a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo courtesy of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confusing and enigmatic sentences that arise by machine translation show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for a few languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints, which often decorate shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo courtesy of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation mistakes may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry, but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more respectable source for its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet presence of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online stations also recorded footage of the protests in Caracas organized by opposition groups opposing the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started in early April after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was coupled, and recommended using the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: reactivates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet site.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular with Internet access to Venezuelans, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media has been hesitant in reporting about protests in 2014. at that time, the Commission on Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission looked at it as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is astonishing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">Later on, the local NGO VEsinfilmtro confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online stations. this also applies to the Internet site on which the National Assembly delegates its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique whereby the DNS servers answer requests for certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds poorly or refuses the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the broadcast was stopped on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections: it is becoming increasingly difficult for Venezuelans to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="417">The article is part of a series called "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying Cows, decaying schools") edited and re-released by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "" "" "she who has become something" "" "" "", "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began working as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas it is known in Paraguay that more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another, more rich family. in exchange, the child gets food, an education and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay for it innumerable days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up.</seg>
<seg id="425">The practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criadita - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and condemned.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated with Criaditas guarantees silence in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">There is, on the one hand, the family who have their daughter in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and "make something different," to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that assimilates the girl and justifies their exploitation with belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise not receive education and maybe even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is abused, his family will experience it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in secret societies in Paraguayan homes, has a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of intense beatings. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military officer Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira hit Marín with a stick until she suffered fatal injury.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo rooted in the Paraguayan society responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They referred the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be "no more Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay there are more cows than children registered," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The couple's neighbors and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the fall.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">When the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be trend-setting - when the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo arrives in court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are exploited not only as labour, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register bankrupt and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market in order to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for instance, cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she was finished with learning, the more leisure she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but she didn't have unlimited food. "I was allowed to fetch more books from the library of the house than food from the fridge," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathiser of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 until 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some evenings the landlord Alvarenga forced him to stand next to him and read editorials from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to convince them not to believe the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they didn't allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would meet" bad habits "again." so they thought that Alvarenga, which belongs to the Indigenous group of Guaraní, would speak their mother tongue to Guaraní again at home.</seg>
<seg id="473">Her masters feared that they would lose the education they had enabled her to lose, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, you were fully aware that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="475">Also at school, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing about which almost never is spoken are bullying and harassals exposed to Criaditas if they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to go home. I didn't have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships develop, I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of all, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Society sanctifies the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="481">In January 2015, a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job ads for cleaning staff and girls in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="482">The administrator of the group is Pepa Kostianovsky, a councillor in the district of Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="483">Hello! I'm looking for a little companion for my little daughter, who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="484">For learning.</seg>

<seg id="486">Start from Monday, if possible.</seg>
<seg id="487">The ad received five "Likes" and many comments.</seg>
<seg id="488">A woman from the village Ñemby wrote that she had a eleven-year-old girl and gave her telephone number.</seg>
<seg id="489">Another woman who came also from Ñemby offered her 15-year-old niece. "she likes small children and is very pretty," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="490">"" "" "" "the third comment was written by" "" "" "" "a girl from the interior that wants to work." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="491">Then the summary of the advertisement laughed once more:</seg>

<seg id="493">Thank you, I write again if something is.</seg>
<seg id="494">The business was complete.</seg>
<seg id="495">In the prologue to the report Criaditas, ¿dosta cuándo?</seg>
<seg id="496">(Criaditas, how long?), a collection of testimonies from former Criaditas, writes Ortiz:</seg>
<seg id="497">In the course of our history we managed to abolish systems such as slavery, Cuñadazgo (a practice from the early history of Paraguay), where the Spanish Conquistadores, the Conquistadores, the women of the Guarani had to pay tribute to them and the system of the Mensa (where the workers as semi-slaves) were subjected to.</seg>
<seg id="498">Social inequality in Paraguay and that to show power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Criadazgo.</seg>

<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, this could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill that consists of six paragraphs and is curated in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs on the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration. it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="524">This article by Todd Reubold was published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions.</seg>
<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north east of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists of the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards, who travels through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). altogether, it is endangered between 800 and 1,000 animals, thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem," and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem will depend on a large predator.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video finds that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist Raza likes to show a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">For six years she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and education programs of Nature Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, it has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and is committed to ensuring that protection zones for wild animals in the region of Kurdistan are set up.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizuga was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still the region is busy rebuilding.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the Northeast of Japan, documented the progress achieved in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a state prefecture in Japan's northeastern prefecture that had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had left whole coastal cities away from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The prefecture of Fukushima still had an atomic accident, already because of this alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local point of view, what progress has been made six years after that to rebuild the lives of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare-houses (the noisai kouei juuaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to achieve the greatest success among the three prefectures. 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed here.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of these houses, whereas Fukushima is at 70 percent the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behelfsacu (in the way, casuetsu juchaku), we still endeavour to resettle into final substitute buildings.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, almost 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36,000 people still lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuees, who were hauled after the disaster, were relocated to final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1,100 schools affected by misfortune had opened their doors to December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have affected agricultural land in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 per cent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear disruption, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima are located in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has largely recovered, but Fukushima is still far away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal dwellers find it difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to obtain an overall picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees. she questioned her about the state of reconstruction and how her empathy has changed vis-à-vis the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami-consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that there is still not enough in terms of catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had to evacuate the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the position of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the mighty earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement buildings.</seg>
<seg id="580">As of 2017, there are still 40 000 Fukushima residents living outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuees, still in shelter, older than 50 years old, are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020.</seg>

<seg id="625">The Unindustralization of Forgotten Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories have closed doors all over Cuba (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular parish Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there are no notable sugars on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After succumbing, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the framework of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuting daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who is standing at 4: 00 every day, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region, which are back in operation after a long inactive period because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">It reminds me that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already opposed the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the country some decades ago, but bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the municipality already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically deprecated, and hardly competitive, they became unbeatable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar rate rose about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, according to the 2016 report.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production reached the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>

<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the decommissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane mills, more than 65 million people, received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats is "deception."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing year, the first letters began to arrive.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents which differed only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the address and the date.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations youths use hip-hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">A song of "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada focus on issues that are important to them. they do so using hip-hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres in 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cree-communities in North Quebec and then worked with the Cree hip-hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop concludes that the young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, engagement, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsums of First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a section of road in Western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the theme of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar Hip-Hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available as a transcript, as is a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to keep going on my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">In this way, they can grow and also go ahead of our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comments section, readers and advocates of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also make a contribution and add the verse to silo script (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential clients, which is exactly on the menu, in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (in the way, "plastic models of dishes") are issued by any dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the towering district of Kappabashi, there are a multitude of these small companies that manufacture those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic courts are so usual that they do not even notice them. however, a new trend is now turned into conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver matome the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile tapes decorated with plastic dishes as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were converted to kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin refrigerator magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food production is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an Empress-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We have also produced this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple containing your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple with a notch for your mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some cell phone stands and cell phone designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, ikura or salmon rogues are used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "" "" "is there anybody who would say" "" "" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon-cheated?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think I will be the only one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and ribbons made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further whimsical plastic dishes can be found at: itinii's Naver matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # 1, which is in the form of the fart.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to know more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly only appear in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the communes who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every corpse, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político established the digital project "apt. a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "live with the drug trafficking"), which will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by traffickers and whole communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>

<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never look at violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've known disease and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only person who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to this or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The futility of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were "rebellious."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to argue that they are spared of such tragedies when they are not stirred and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months blackmail in the capital district: how a family was pillaged with threats." it describes how armed criminals were squeezing money from their business for month, until they had torn apart not only the business, but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of it never goes, the trauma remains, the fear comes back high when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will take you away or kill you." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked myself if weeping would resolve my deep-rooted emotions, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the post "The Forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation drawn by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he says that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, sown potatoes, heat tortillas and make "chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was only a couple of blocks away from his home, the bloody body of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez was like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of murders according to the citizen's council for public security and government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office counted 3103 murders.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "apt. a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking the country has tortured in the last four decades in an intelligible way.</seg>

<seg id="817">"sharing is Caring" by Flickr user Niklas Wikström (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNMENT: this post and the pages to which he links contain images depicting violence.</seg>
<seg id="818">The faktencheck is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or exposing a forgery.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has emerged for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its initial release, it has been used irreversibly to cover tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">However, it poses questions about our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank truck crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped up and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous paths filled with potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank truck fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball containing dozens of houses including a movie theater nearby, which was full of people watching the FIFA World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burnt and corded corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were incinerated for recognition.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." by the user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident depict the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows series of charred bodies lined up on the floor while people look at it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photograph was copied several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, combatants from Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses repeatedly reported atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "" "" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "" "" "no one left to count dead bodies," "" "" "" "said a Human Rights Watch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been shattered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be depicted in a figurative manner.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the Boko Haram attempt to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo again appeared, when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and potential magnitude of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false attributions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as evidence for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example falsely link the picture from DR Congo with sources of mass media to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash report published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee could kill, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from the violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following, who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi-Arab news page, who falsely claimed that the President of Myanmar's Than Being said that monks and politicians had participated in the killing of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to cover this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood of misinformation and misinformation suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and complicates the actual horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of violent images has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equivalent to recognising the tragedy. sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern that violent images depict readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study investigates how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to debate about violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will need to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be detached from context or completely improper style.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, every study of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. irreplaceable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings, which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly any attempt at a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">The blog contains, for example, words from Vanuatu's Mwotlap language, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Take care of your parents in recognition of how they have made an effort in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">Words in the Hunset language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or laziness you feel after you have been warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They demoralize me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>

<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways. but somehow we all are put in the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims, who do not fit into it, become Muslim.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for storytelling aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), learning stories in their original language is a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices recently reported on another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that assume diversity - safe spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "" "" "while" "" "" "" "listening often is often associated with understanding" "" "" "" "instead of listening to" "" "" "" "listening to cherishing, feeling." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers put their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and representation will lead to the audience becoming adept.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this turn, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamara tells the fabel of rabbits and the baboon in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fabel, John Nyamara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were alert...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Up to now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico demands US reelection of sovereign debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">On 3 April 2017, various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration with the aim of a re-check of the public debt of Puerto Rico. the march started in Capitol, the capital of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Citizens front for the neural check of debts) and the ecclesiastical church meeting Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates for re-fixing the debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and family continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, an event was dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publisher of book Sprints' finished books within three to five days read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: a collective enquiry).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and available here royalty-free contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It pays homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what the real costs are with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted out of the directory of the Adra prison, in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about its present state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, and immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing Bassel paying a high price for his participation in a free culture has allowed many of us to start thinking about their own fate, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of times of extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police" Bassel had taken the basis of a command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Long, a designer, technologist and, at the moment, the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basque's cultural prototypes was more profane than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would do everything to extinguish this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strife in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel has not yet finished concluding this project.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am overwhelmed when I call His name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he has taught others to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He taught others how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a commission that she wrote to her husband in 2012-2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together for one year alongside the book.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available royalty free.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: director, convicted of corruption, returns to previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique responded with anger to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state machine where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Dioino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years in prison for the impoverishment of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose Council presided over Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for its reinstatement to the company, which took place on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to resume his old post, as the company did not conduct disciplinary proceedings after its detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not welcome the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, in an interview with Deutsche Welle condemned the company's decision to put the director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and exemplifies the lack of transparency and is even a step back in terms of the efforts of our legal system," "" "" "" "said CIP." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also have instituted a disciplinary procedure against the act of refutation.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company, however, apparently kept silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as "disgusting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would have been adviser after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish up his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza will be happy to pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Irresistible!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director has no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insults him. I can't believe that you are rewarded by such a way that has insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morality and serves the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served himself only by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man, who was preloaded and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">To be honest, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeún prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief is in jail:</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts out of the network, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still debated about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjectives "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "" "" "Facebook censored the word" "" "" "" "Kalar" "" "" "" "or," "" "" "", "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely aberrant connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been censored for its use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same sequence of letters as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese as' Kalar htaing ', which contains the same letters as well as other words like' Kalar pae '(spider bse),' Kalar OAT '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way to know if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - is very similar to racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There have been several reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is of the opinion that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it eradicates all posts that are suspected of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook doesn't delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write about factook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words that are standing next.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (stool) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech have received quite a good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now it is time to circumcise her nationalism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who propagates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or alternative way of writing the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from Facebook for 24 hours because the post "didn't meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a number of posts from people who have no negative intent or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author shared his view of why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "" "" "in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and forbidden such words as" "" "" "" "throne" "" "" "" "or" "" "" "" "curry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook censorship has caused a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now making fun of Facebook and consciously writing the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken off the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not include hate speech, but were removed:</seg>

<seg id="1343">The toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament voted unanimously on a law to ban this practice, so that the age-ready age is now 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Before this change of the law some members adhered to the practice of Hindu and Muslim religious communities, and in May 2016 there was a great public cry. at that time, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, a group representing representatives of the various religious groups in the country, said that the state should not interfere because that, age does not determine maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This was notwithstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contracting partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights, the minors as, each person under 18 years of age. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">UN statistics for 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical central office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, which endeavored to abolish laws for children's toe, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">But not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about saying the critics of the children's marriage, they should, damn, take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This sort of religious opposition ensured tension in this actually uncomplicated thing, and at some point there arose doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the bill of law at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the toe-marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who abstained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the marriage of children was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and no one decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users was enthralled because the laws on children's marriage had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">"" "" "" "Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a ministerial post in the Ministry of Education, said:" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk, which has covered the core of the matter, but do you know what? the toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost any price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was the opinion of Abel, it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status Update on Facebook by Lara Quentral- Thomas, stating:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The law has been decided.</seg>

<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who was quite openly discussing how important the adoption of the law said:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age-ready age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft to amend the marriage was approved today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives there are 41 deputies and 35 of them were present in the vote.</seg>

<seg id="1373">Congrats. congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the country's most famous Hindu organization.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj announced his intention of taking into court steps should the law be adopted, and he seems to deliver his promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wishes to proceed against the law, most social media users desired that the debate on the subject would be different.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Wormackl suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Rather, instead of talking about the problem, rather than talking about the problem that the state, our daughters, protects it from being misused by large, hard-boiled men who are in favour of them, would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a lawsuit against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children are legally or still the norm in different gradations, even though there are laws which they prohibit.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented internationally in contrast to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States on January 18, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey is blocking the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series fight against the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech savvy Internet users are used to using rending tools for blocked websites (a current article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia for 2008, as recently described in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blocking of the Internet has been taking place since 2007 after the internet law (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked there are now several mirror sites (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the Interplantation File System), when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine host connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is, in spite of legal prohibition, available.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the locking of Wikipedia), we put all the snapshots of Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the contents in a decentralized and distributed fashion.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live- or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonny of Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirrorpage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites if Wikipedia is locked in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices and co-workers at Mozilla at the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses another URL that is not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server guides the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia, if they are closed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A sustenance of Nashorn, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with badly positioned motifs and balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune's animal world to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that attract attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when I suddenly called to Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti River would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river-dam is only a few minutes from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to bend my pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to co-operate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he already stood face to face with tigers:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't disturb himself by the opinion of the sheep not when sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late at night. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the boy appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for all" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, mostly living in a tent in order to take pictures of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid the utmost care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "" "" "instead they use a pronoun or say" father of my child. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto from the Indian state of Odisha was convicted by a fictional court and rejected by her family and the community after having contacted a married relative with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of not naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer remittances to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health personnel as well as housewives, joined a unique club and became the main adornment of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the Campaign # KhelBadal that is operated by the Video Volunteers community and is committed to the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paine has been working for seven years using her video camera to detect practices such as childmarriage up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors for change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was women who did not call their husbands name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands out loud is a custom that they all dutifully uphold and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never known her husband by name, wanted to try at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said," "" "" "" "I should call him henceforth by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some thought it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "" "" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Paz from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that throughout the whole exercise she just kicked her; another decided to let the whole frustration come out against him and his family by cursing it.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenaline rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put the women in the head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was frightened and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "" "" "another woman said:" "" "" "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation turned out to be violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women have attempted to stop other practices, such as wearing the zincrose dot on the forehead that shows the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would wear the zincrose dot if he did." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped, but they think they are now in a better position to choose, not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we make a trip at every discus club." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want women to take care of who could hear what," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so frankly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to tell certain things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only borne saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people it's okay, but some wanted to have a Salem-Kurt, a wide shirt over trousers. they didn't dare to do so.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes, morality related to saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own pair of tas (upper shirts) into a discussion round so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to take a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question as to whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have only made small steps so far." ""</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, still do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of dress - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1553">It became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, president of the Single Market Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today is the Beatles-Memorial Day in Japan. in the middle of 51 years they were here in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="1583">The police of Zambézia warned the people that bald men could be in Mozambique's target of attacks.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald individuals for the organ trade, presumably for non-believing purposes, worries the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Millau, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs had been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There are local superstitions that the head of a bald man can reveal gold or bring wealth, said the police spokesman of Zambézia di BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of killings for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country in 2016 to examine this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the town of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who plan to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to bald men, who travel to Mozambique, men in Mozambique are target ritual attacks, the Mozambican police warned against the latest assassinations of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milky, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Husband Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and assassination of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mortarbala, province of Zambézia, has been commissioned by the traditional shamans, this draws the police of the Republic of Mozambique in view (PRM), which also indicates that there is a faith in which the sacrifices in the head might have power to generate wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of Bloggers' poor Snaippa on Facebook, suggesting that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I AM IN Mozambique, THAT I AM ashamed One country where people would be ashamed to demand sex against good marks, and take their lives to earn their bread, a land in which neither the Albinos nor bald or bald-headed could be hunted for aberratic purposes or "black magic" aimed at speedy riches.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some people could not miss the opportunity for macabre humour.</seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida Machado, scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and thrilled Twitter users, tweetete that both the chief of the district of Mortarbala, Pedro Sange and the police spokesman Zambézias, Inácio Dina, are both bald-headed:</seg>
<seg id="1606">The Mozambican authorities are very concerned about the murders of bald humans.</seg>

<seg id="1625">Free Bassel: netizen Under Serious Threat, December 2012 (in English) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winner and dissident Liu Xiaobo</seg>
<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably only recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention in international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "Subversion" (state jeure) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Liu's case as "an internal affair," and said a spokesman, he deemed it "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China will continue to receive calls from the international community, Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to allow him to go abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the stringent treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations: United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to facilitate treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's prime minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Liu release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government told us that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his imprisonment, he was not able to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China for release Lius, as stated in an explanation on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we also expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Liu's wife and family members." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States</seg>
<seg id="1652">Ambassador Terry Branstad told us that the Americans "wish him the possibility of treatment abroad in so far as it helps him in his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on June 27 that the Embassy of China calls on the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to release his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The U.S. Embassy instituted a furious response from China, with the Foreign Ministry's statement that "no country has the right to interfere and to make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told China that China should offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, which they claim in accordance with the Chinese Constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also introduced a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1659">Germany - United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="1660">German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin, hopes that "Liu" gets all the medical support he needs, "and that a" humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority. "</seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing reported Reuters's news agency that China had great concerns about whether the fuss surrounding Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian Ambassador John McCallum invited China to provide liu with appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police have always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues talks:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada is calling on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and freedom of engagement for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France - France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on June 29:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and his family are to have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information about whether France would ultimately take it up.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan and Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of mainland Affairs in Taiwan asked China on June 27 to release Liu and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called for China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned about Liu in an explanation on June 28 and stated that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Liu Xiaobo who signed Charter 08 which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked if New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The Cavalierio blog accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we can say that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries," in view of that, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once one reaches the core of the subject, the good old Lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, in the last week of Shanmugam, responses to his American guests concerning our press, our Judictative, our political system were truly non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised appropriate questions with non-answers of rational kind.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point, as long as he was paid high in order to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he pointed out concerning the criticisms that one should begin to read the entire transcript of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore is more like a "city" than a country, "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore to cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "" "" "when he said Singapore" "" "" "" "no country," "" "" "" "he obviously did not mean in this sense!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation that makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice has said of Singapore..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard who expected me - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes this, properly associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review decomposes the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "" "" "Mr. Shanmugam" "" "" "" "did a mistake" "" "" "" "committed or was it a Freudian slip-over?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country do the sovereign rights of Singapore return?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is both country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the cabinet of the government, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but do they defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay our prime minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff expansion?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>

<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First, to be called "nice" is basically to be fun - like the benevolent, gentle yet tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has his own Canadian double-loner).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing at which you can stumble.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means being unobtrusive and uninteresting and not worthy of attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if you want to stay in the background unnoticed, far away from things happening around you.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that parodies the Junta, who took power in 2014 and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Maker describes a young man who tells the rules of his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not politically, the music video is indirectly related to the Junta's continued military rule.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days alone, the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.254 times and received 8.800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month the Charlie Chaplin video "The dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video relating to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" possibly refer to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision-making over important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the infamous program for "Changes Change" of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people viewed by the Junta as critics.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society only slowly recovers in East-Asia Minor, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">More than 20 years have passed since the Georgian-abchastic war officially ended, but its scars are still visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilles are located in the coal basin of Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Depuas, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most of the Russians and chases live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period there were still more than 10,000 people here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district amounted to 16,000 people after having barely climbed over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">About 43,000 people lived in this district in 1989.</seg>

<seg id="1831">The people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have left the district in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="1832">In the ghost town of Dzhantukha, approximately fifty inhabitants live.</seg>
<seg id="1833">About 38 people live in Akarmara, in the other villages it looks similar.</seg>

<seg id="1898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and golden earrings in teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, tells Mrs Ramírez, the people come to full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you in Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and gets them to the hospital when they are ill, she buys them drugs that they can't pay, she massaged them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao leaves with his sister hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel together and that Africans already speak about Whatsapp by Ms. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mom Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Ms Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "" "" "he answers, smiling." "" "" "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her that her guests often send word messages when they went away to greet her or to tell her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken up migrants in their small home." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a hob outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "" "" "there are places where people will help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">Having lived there for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants coming through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to extract money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single mother, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, the travellers should consult their phones easily.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves in her album with a lot of photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair spots she has made her an Kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, young and old.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities area in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a mobile phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "" "" "in the announcement, it is said that the app" "" "" "" "prevents access to terrorist information." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities should also use the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police reported that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangen's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans, and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can, of course, be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages on digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censorship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" (Spain), published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police officers indiscriminately examined the residents whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiano ensure that people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they may be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use appliances designed for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (Spain), as well as a Jingwang product description, also published a Jingwang product description, indicating that the software can lift the password request from a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones become electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions associated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">An up-to-date report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also alluded to these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media storage cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the rights of Urumqi's three million inhabitants and gives them punishments for a number of other possible violations, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Embarlam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emballam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emballam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he slows down to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and also to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine-stained lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs's family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as rock yeasts (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and scrutinizes their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed music.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all of these topics are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his thinking, and he can sympathise with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special aversion to the American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones, have something to do with his identity as a "Palestinian wing of the second generation," he calls himself, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't think about my own circumstances," "" "" "" "stressed Hdaib." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so because I am a man," while he pour into water dissolved Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot June day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the gap of lukewarm coffee and the squats of the Kent-cigarette in the nose speak first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if you look at the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to avoid doing basic things - as in public during Ramadan drinking water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Ministry announced an appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic promotion front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former press spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahrib said in an interview with CNN that the concert had just been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which injects the old-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the whole region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to stand up for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib repressed traditional gender norms by educating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently low-trodden unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of "Honorary morals" - the unofficial frontiers.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch, according to Human Rights Watch, reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have been victims of murders or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a 1954 anti-crime legislation, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "indefinitely be imprisoned in prison," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditures and the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from subjects that long considered to be taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and freedom of expression, not from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "I was fed up with politics," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song titled "Santorano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song one verse often repeats itself quite often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it too." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can, in his words, "get what you want" - be it faith or not faith, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan is talking about the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to see later that his comments were torn from context, distorted and in his opinion censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed up only a modified version," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance against homosexuals does not disagree with Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in his memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nualle, who was later to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Hashemite kingdom there is nothing new any more that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">More recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service noted several former members of the government and members of the Teachers' Association, arguing that they were critical of the problems associated with the corruption that was deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's how it looks like Hdaib - is made up of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially induced democracies. at least he hopes.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman was a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumes that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the solid cars, drums and dancing have been handed over for over a thousand years and come from a time when armies marched from the west of Japan to the northeast to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community center in the capital, Meguro-Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro-Gayoen for a long time: two solid cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend their summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebuchaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of a 18-meter-tall car was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, external appearance and body care were as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian young out of criminality and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for esthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance, and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hair styles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other in order to show who can create the most exact looks, as can be seen in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Education institutions such as Augusto Salazar Bondy, who is located in El Callao, have an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to obtain a training in the art of hairdressing, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of youngsters have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud of, because we have built up this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of Love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "" "" "the following article is the edited version of the" "" "" "" "love messages to guerrilla fighters" "" "" "", "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The post will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it even more important to meet people who feel discouraged?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of Leonardo Párraga, young Columbian activist Leonardo Párraga from the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspired her to write letters to the Carta por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the setting of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos for his merits received the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillas who have lived in illegal camps for many years, subjected to war rhetoric and carrying their weapons around the clock must now return to life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases, accustomed to deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take it into its ranks and support them in the creation of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Columbians would join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly that they did: so far, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as Inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those they need much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He was planning to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC fighters that will now find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC acted as they had done before to counteract the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut where the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because beside him there was a MGL garnet, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty battle.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "" "" "I replied," "" "" "" "Hello, what do they do?" "" "" "" "he answered," "" "" "" "I will answer a letter that someone has written to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "never in my life someone has written something such a beautiful thing, so I answer it." "" "" "" "suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I embraced him completely and sat down beside the garnet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of war, but he was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life as a war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that outside there is a society waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I just learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "" "" "but now that peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some leaders of the FARC have joined a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have witnessed the social injustice on the part of the State to the whole of the Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "" "" "for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "" "" "one of them said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Listening to these people, who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated them were only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the reality in which the country lives, hurts me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men, including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and embrace.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Colombians were told that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to resort to arms, raise up and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now put on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>

<seg id="2242">It follows the translation of an article written by our partner Aida Mirmaksumowa and his first publication on the OC Media website.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Homosexuals and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of dangers, including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="2244">In horror, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat, which hangs above the LGBTQ community in the local LGBTQ community, did not come into being until night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has won international headlines several months ago after reports have been published showing the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities who arrested queer men and put them in secret prisons in gun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a Transwife, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since childhood she felt that she was in reality a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens had learned about the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">For fear of her life, she eventually moved to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was a volunteer worker in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya who can eliminate that shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos from my documents made the rounds through the WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just about to pop out a few shopping bags from the seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I hurt nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "" "" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "" "" "how long will you still honor the family, you cry?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that it was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had received everything and started shouting.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung mule.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you laid - in which of the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for treating me with respect.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "last February I received threats." ""</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They posed absurd demands: some told me I had to prove it by walking up without through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was just bad speech, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once talked to my mother in the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "" "" "they said to her," "" "" "" "They have brought a monster to the world, which has humiliated not only your family but the whole republic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "" "" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately, the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window there stood a car with dark window panes and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not grasp how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering without identification, without knowing anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked in at the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe you are in security, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "" "" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">"" "" "" "OC Media: do you still have contact with your family?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about the gender equality, that's a taboo theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this psychological barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who stayed dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I talked to someone who has spent one and a half months in her gun." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told us that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not finish a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">In this way I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood gratification.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there's just not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "" "" "say," "" "" "" "Shall they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and say they have attacked any village or military base." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately submerged in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was incarcerated one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">Since then there has been nothing new from them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person himself was there when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports yet. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise wouldn't they have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that already before 2003 I was already known in Grosny when I was living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russia originally wanted to introduce us to" "" "" "" "civilisation" "" "" "", "but ultimately forced us back to the Stone Age." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had coloured eyelashes, wearing tubes jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia never bent my hair down.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spare not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children if they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they closed their eyes in front of you because they thought you were ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov stepped up to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak about morals on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but above all about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could sense how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who smiled before and laughed at once looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation worsened in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activities are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise tea bags, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I applauded refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Nature has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth that there are no gays.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestani have those who have Kabardino, the Russians also have; on the whole planet they are - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan, live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think at Transient to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now.</seg>

<seg id="2401">He lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>

<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn't do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>

<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 saw great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable utility areas for Iranian farming.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the local population receives little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often a victim of ill-treated diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahwazi Arabs to work in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams that divert water from the Arab areas to the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravating the devastation caused by dryness in the region, and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The rate of unemployment among the Arab Ahawzi adolescents rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Administrator-General for Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and compel them to earn their living outside their home Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first name and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and thus be employed, as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speaking Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In view of the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ahwazi, human rights activists are alerting alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>

<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put through well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be feminine in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women today still earn less money than men despite the same education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come across a glass ceiling before or later in various spheres of life, and that discrimination on grounds of sex is still moving across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to skin colour, on racism, on black women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused with racial segregation and discrimination, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices" and "Kumbaya, my Lord" to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalised form of racial-motivated violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often directed to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of all skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands who refuses to take into account imperfections in her thinking, which relate both to the sex and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "" "" "sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "" "" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a dreadful and marginalised being in historical terms." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation, in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlap skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement totaling silence no matter how many black women are trying to teach them a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different income a home and isolate themselves from white Feminism, the word "feminism" still lies in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to dissociate myself completely from feminism and join the movement of womanism that has been established for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than advocating for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we have black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clunia Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming (about: Africa-Womanism: how we recapture ourselves) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and can be worshipped in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can uplift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman, I am recognized as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life is neither skipped nor ignored.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" from structural issues. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# graviteinefrieure), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police inspector told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had been violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time has gone by and the police said their statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife of Balbuena was shown due to abuse, Ada Báez's informed ad was also useless.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her display.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women ever submit an advertisement at all, they generally do not receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence should report at all to the law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Contents 1 Beblows and Statistics 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that has nothing submerged to Paraguayan laws: good approach, poor implementation impacts and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudio, a social science research institute in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports, which do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers are, however, alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney General opened 9600 ads for domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 indications of domestic violence in the peace courts. 86% of women were reported here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "for every woman who reports in Paraguay due to psychological abuse, there are 9 women who do not.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there are two women who cannot do this because of physical abuse," "" "" "" "she declared at the end of 2014." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since there is no criminal offence in Paraguay, the law enforcement authorities cannot document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists count at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The co-ordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to her estimations, in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violent acts by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that does not undermine</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then gave up. this should always regret her.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos. but for two years she wore psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the ill treatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had so long enjoyed Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, spent nearly eight years fighting with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner abused them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the testimonies of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities stayed without result and also from their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She took a trial against her former partner, who developed into an unmanageable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, mainly for money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a Bill of Law was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament under the hashtag # Port Ellas (# Prince).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the motion # NiUnaMenos (# Nonnatives) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law foresees that feminid must be declared a criminal offender and to punish harsher as it is the case in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the text was changed in some respects, in order to also win the deputies for the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions is banned, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original draft law had envisaged that the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence must themselves bear on their own if they simply want to report an advertisement and receive a secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of inter-human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethink must take place so that violence is no longer considered a normal thing.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Who is silent in the face of these facts, is complicit and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators get out of their way.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must report as long as abuse is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law had been modified, including a passage that the partners had called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">However, the cancellation of the words "gender," "political violence" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law, however, is regarded as a major setback.</seg>

<seg id="2546">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this website was blocked because of a resolution of the Minister of Information" "" "" "" "on the home page of the banned paper Azamn." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the omanic authorities closed the independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn for their coverage of corruption in the sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison, where he is serving a one-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and brought to trial, but later returned.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after serving his father, Said bin Taimur, through a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, he has held the main offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The rule of the Sultans is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular domestic secret services, restricting public freedoms, including freedom of the press, restricting and detecting human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically restrict human rights to peaceful and legitimate activities and prevent citizens, including activists, to freely express their views on the public affairs of the country, such as corruption in public authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper in which since its foundation in 2007, corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces seized Ibrahim Al-Maamari, editor-in-chief of Azamn, after an article entitled "High-ranking parties bind the hands of the judiciary" on 26 July 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, member of the Editorial Board, was charged before the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, ISS drew the deputy chief editor Yousef Al-Haj, who acted as chief editor after Al-Maamaris's arrest.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that "the publication and dissemination of the newspaper on any way, including online, is prohibited from August 9, 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first trial was held in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted of disruption of public order, abuse of the Internet, and "undermining the Present of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, Al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years "imprisonment and fines of 3000 omaniac rial each (7800 US dollars). moreover, a one-year prohibition against the two journalists was imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of the use of "an information network for the dissemination of material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri a bail was set at the height of 5000 omanic Rial (13,000 US dollars) and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 before the Judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for one year and al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his 6-month prison sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison, where he is serving his one-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to include the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the court to relinquish Azamn, the newspaper still faces attacks by the omanic government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, with which the minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appeal to re-introduce the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press was violated in Oman recently.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Other violations include, for example, the closure of the site of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the country's first independent online newspaper, to cease its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the arrest of journalist Al-Haj, the impression that the omanic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) calls on the omanic authorities:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. release Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn, so that their journalists can pursue their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and</seg>
<seg id="2583">4. in all circumstances to ensure that human rights defenders and journalists in Oman have unfettered their rights to human rights and without fear of reprisals, including judicial chicans.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, illustration takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for locally carried out medical research: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the particular medical needs on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, the research conducted by African scientists is helping to build its own research capacities in Africa. a larger role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched himself on the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national programme of antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I have just launched a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always stay on the receiver rather than being a maker yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not applicable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are promoted differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what's the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic education, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, healthcare (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called "Paywall") also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that talks about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 grades, such as Outrageous, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For nearly 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only applied to individual types, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more of these patents have been applied to more and more plants, such as cereal or carrots. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds salad, but in the meantime he needs longer because his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is as if there is a boulder in a river to whom I have to paddle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do that now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think these patents go too far on salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of lettuce because all the features are already patented. "so he continues to do as best as possible and tries to breed those traits that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very cautious and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">"" "" "" "he also joined a movement that will become ever greater in the USA and all over the world: open source Breeding (" "" "" "" "Open Source" "" "" "" ")." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red red lettuce of the variety Outrageous in the "glasshouse" of the station and ate. there, it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who purchase their seeds to breed their own varieties and do not cut it out immediately - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Somber prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seed and the ability to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds therefore play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement is not occupied with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological farming or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability," he says and takes on the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, whose recent examples are the combinations of ChemChina and Syngenta and Bayer, which are offered in August and September 2016.

<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights available on plant material that is becoming more and more restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all the carton characteristics are protected as intellectual property, making it impossible for plant breeders to be usable either at all or only makes it more difficult to use.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants such estimates do not exist yet, but experts like Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat in even greater style are patented than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they exhibit desirable traits - from those by which their taste or colour is improved to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and resist threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much less predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Ministry of Agriculture, the company is committed to preserving the genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts the belief that intellectual property includes other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expires.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not prevent innovation, but fosters them by making more material and know-how available to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it differently: waiting for 20 years until a patent expels, certainly does not promote innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed to plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain: "independent plant breeders do not have time or money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "" "" "this is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us if we can't continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Morton is interfering with the concept of using plant features:" "" "" "" "we don't really create the features ourselves." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breed a breed also bred their own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures whose cultivation requires mass-based herbicides, cultivates into its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "" "" "my concept is exactly contrary." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as Monsanto are) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads at his Breeding Garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties for a few years, "he says." with a patent you have been protected for 20 years in front of competition, which makes it very easy in my opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">While the US seems to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept now spreads quickly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources, runs a "open-source" seed program.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "" "" "it also supports them to come to" "" "" "" "open source" "" "" "" "seeds and sell their own." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agrecol is working on an open-source licence, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, so the Ossi obligation can not easily be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the European Commission's executive committee, the European Commission, stated that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable, thus addressing the current practice of the European Patent Office which permits patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is still not a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed patenting.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's "Open Source" seed system, states that the organization is currently building a global alliance for "open source" seed systems for which the official launch should fall for the next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">An association of environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food, has published a report. it believes that farmers must have the opportunity to come to seeds, to exchange ideas and to improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also emphasises the importance of a diverse local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Luby von Ossi hopes that more people will soon recognise him.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological food has particularly taken care of where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," "" "" "" "says Luby." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest objectives of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock contents on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organization and blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of May 5th, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports them above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August the network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities strongly criticised this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains unchanged in spite of this attack and the mocking of Egyptian rights and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law and to give victims a voice. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network from Qatar for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: first human rights organization has fallen victim to the wave of web sites. @ anhri is one of the main sources of human rights in the Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, the blog of columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada no longer has access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles, which he writes for websites and media not accessible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the Egyptian government's censorship was even the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider that is also home to the Ziadas blog, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, reporting on the student protests and recording a video like the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment Ziada spoke about the government's blockage and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and although the blogging of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) I managed to convey the feeling of a state of siege; arrest, attempted murder, unloading at the National Security Council, the blogging blogs and any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, however, after they have blocked it and that they are scared of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked out 133 pages from May 24 to August 6. these resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">It also documented the locking of vendors, which enabled Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the locking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice points to the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering the content that the Egyptian users might have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis to proceed against these actions in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants are quarrelling.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in Brazil report with dark slogans from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of many postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old killed in school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Thieves rough pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers to the army, navy and air port to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2757">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Brazilian Non Governmental Organization Global Justice has even called on the United Nations to intervene." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">The newspaper "Extra," known for detailed reporting on violence in Rio on 16 August, published the editorial "This is not normal" in which it announced to set up a new column called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now being published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper this way:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that deviates from the civilized standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the paper, stated that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a martial brik in a country that doesn't recognise the war at all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist in the newspaper states that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police that first shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" damage more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a "war." this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to accountable officials responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public services.</seg>
<seg id="2774">As a reminder, Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">Labeling Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," according to Cecília, according to the statistics of 2015, 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and north-east of the country.</seg>

<seg id="2780">In addition to Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecília emphasizes, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">The creation of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, was one of these security policy measures aimed at capturing a favela by deploying a massive police commandment and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this led to a decrease in violent deaths. however, after several reports, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria set by the Geneva Convention - the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "war back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police omitted the mountain with the favela Jacetzinho in order to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence this incident also made headlines: an orreseller died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal backing and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to wins Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these areas controlled by rebels have been besieged outside Damascus, which resulted in inhabitants being dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian Helpers and academics are teaching the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a life-saving food source.</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alison and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi do not belong to the conventional food grown in Syria and are only very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>

<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo is used in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alison.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the planting of mushrooms, according to Dr. Leila at Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of about €12,700, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo by Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2818">Due to the shortage of fuel, locally produced plastic fuel is used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the "production of fungal seeds from the regions," before they checked their quality and, if they were suitable for consumption.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government called for a state shower last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galician region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire eruptions that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite images, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2847">João Soveral from the Confederation of Farmers of Portugal explained the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">According to Pedrógão roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>

<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal for the shape of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed the construction activity to fall if the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open back door, so that everything could be built," João Sorval goes on in the same article of the newspaper Público.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees of slightly inflammable wood, as in a vicious circle, always spread further to the fires of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems add to the fact that Portugal's Civil Defence web site on 15 and 16 October, when residents were seeking information or trying to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: it took advantage of its own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire department and was so decisive on this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not stand the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the site was more than half a million people.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In one night in the autumn of 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan by the Taliban started.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years before, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups who had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Exactly at that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belonged to the ethnic group of the Hazara, sat in the province of Ghazni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother did not say that at that time, she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">At dawn, the boy was to break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the smugglers.</seg>

<seg id="2883">CC-2.0</seg>
<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been killed by the Taliban, and many Hazara suddenly felt unsettled.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf recovered in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran. once again, he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged bags with mortars that were heavier than he himself to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows to avoid freezing at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years Asharaf left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered shipwreck and landed on a small uninhabited island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his request for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid people twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high expectations, Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions prevailing in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "" "" "the Human Rights Organization" "" "" "" "Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes," "" "" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">The large majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3,000 "special reception centres." these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a recording centre if they officially filed an application for asylum - which can still be delayed for months after the asylum application has been registered.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible lifestyles helped Asharaf to liberate himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having worked for several years in the construction industry, Asharaf was able to put all of his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This worked so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis Success Story is now the subject of documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian Luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by Amin Wahidi's director.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the road to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghan-owned companies, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants have emerged.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient experience, where the waiters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashara's goals reach far beyond the Italian gastronomy sector and retail, and aim to reach the country which he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "where a risk is, there are opportunities," "" "" "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "" "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces in the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "" "" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also creates plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques. "so they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this road.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearing of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the removal of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo of @ Ciluna27 on Twitter shared.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocate's netizen report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft law stating that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register to use social networks within six months of submitting their full name and identification number within six months of submitting their full name and identity.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who neglect this step could be sentenced to up to six months "imprisonment or the tribunals of a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the law, which was applied by 60 members of parliament, is currently before legislative and constitutional committees of the Parliament and should be debated there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another member of the Parliament sent a legislative proposal to introduce stricter sanctions for the insult of the President or a high ranking official.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law, such an act would, however, be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is to be passed, this can mean three years "imprisonment for the convicts.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "furthermore, this would support a political climate in which freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed the demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting, like more than 700 participants, who were arrested at the same incident, four years in prison for a date of trial.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison leadership failed due to human rights groups to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatened the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, pseudo-possession of, among other things, weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza opened the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage of pro-Morsi seat blockade on the Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogations of Tunisian activists on secured documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaath and the Global Voices advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia has been largely interrogated by the President of the Republic who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial draft law that would ensure officers and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption official amnesty, provided they return all unlawful funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the Nawaath website on April 21 throws a light on how the presidential plans appear to support the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben-Gharbia rejected the naming of his sources stating the provisions of Article 11 of the Tunisian press of the press, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China force users of social media to submit their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new regulations of the Government Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the provisions, it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts believe that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks. it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>

<seg id="2961">This term is part of a law in 2014, thanks to which the Russian Government leads a list of online services that "organize" the publication of the information. "the law also allows the government to make use of said services for the removal of content and to force it on request to suspend user data.</seg>

<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the locking of Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators have refused to delete two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications announced that the site had been blocked because it became "a source of information that cooperates with groups in order to instigate a political diffusion campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website. it is, in addition to China, one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
