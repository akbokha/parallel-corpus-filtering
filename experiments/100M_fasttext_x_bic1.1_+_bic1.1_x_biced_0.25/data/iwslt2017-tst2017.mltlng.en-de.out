that is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before anyone of Edward Snow@@ den had heard , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed over designs for a nuclear bomb to Iran .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter didn &apos;t like at all ?
the US government .
for nearly 10 years , the government has identified Ris@@ en and called upon him to name his supposed sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media has the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the courageous ones whom they do not give .
so when the government tied up with Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived at risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they had stated for years that it would be essential in their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped to Ris@@ en .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
instead of separating and calcul@@ ating Ris@@ en , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly ap@@ pre@@ h@@ ended his telephone call , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit agreement , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
amid this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey ster@@ ling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ er of supposed source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in his attempt to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead , justice served more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since 11 September , almost every article about national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional complaint because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as the government allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources .
they can do that from the moment they are in contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that didn &apos;t exist as Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source editing system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet celeb@@ r@@ ity , which was originally developed by us , Aaron Swar@@ tz , and has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the relevant news agency has access .
so the government cannot obtain more information secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have the possibility of making mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who wants to know about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and reports of over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker who strikes the alarm for the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were sent from news on a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm , based in Panama .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to firms like the mos@@ a@@ bean fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a trail of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads through a close friend of childhood days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people this whole world seems very conf@@ using , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US .
probably because there were no prominent Americans who were present in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but through the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ aken Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some U.S. countries you need less information , need less information to start a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
fraud has allowed che@@ aters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring a suspi@@ cious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked us that all to one lawyer made suggestions as to how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money for it . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very preten@@ tious as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a borrow@@ ed optim@@ ist , I can see that some things have begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have seen suggestions for more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has gathered in central registers on a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind it .
representatives of both parties introduced a draft law in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseu@@ do @-@ firms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy to get up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this type of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the boot of a red car .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stood still and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . then he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was getting late . I became tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land kidn@@ apped in the luggage compartment of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ?
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is mad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ aked at ti@@ thes to the door , and closed my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold as strangers to me in childhood were actually friends who only waited to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time leap , two years later ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate vac@@ ill@@ ates and the rent is increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe creativity can create fear into fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and breakfast each morning .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we could simultaneously find new friends and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ phar@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
so we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when a visit comes over .
over the Internet , they can then invite strangers to stay overnight with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the rocket to light .
but they do not .
nobody who is still very con@@ sol@@ ed would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you will concentrate on the things you can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to build trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of which degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbor .
this quiet touch of panic you &apos;re feeling now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they spend the night somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es &apos;s cell phone ?
could you please proclaim on Twitter that he is can@@ dic@@ ated for the president &apos;s office ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbour had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told wh@@ ence he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he really can hold on very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to release your mobile phone ?
because a well thought out feedback system rein@@ forces confidence .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their convi@@ ctions before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we studied how likely it is for people to trust each other , depending on how similar they relate to age and place of residence .
we trust most of the people who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by app@@ rais@@ als .
if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing will change .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stands out for common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted likes .
in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you are priced .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you talk too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you will not get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request will not be accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I do my family vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to reject these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered before .
for us business is just going very well .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who were un@@ lawful part@@ ying parties or devast@@ ated apartments .
the hosts took guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project , I worked in the customer service department . all phone calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front when trust was broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than these calls . it &apos;s hur@@ ting if I just think about it .
the disappointment that was heard in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million medi@@ ated nights had a problem .
for people have confidence in one another .
when trust works , wonderful things can occur .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay where he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travellers who are prone to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who can save their lives even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you ride one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring you books .
they can stay even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay goes off .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I first stum@@ bled across this term , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing reconci@@ le with money transactions ?
it &apos;s about economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing will not do justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
share economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling was a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if at any place you visited , a group there would wait for a group there to fill a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood of a pub , of which you &apos;ve never heard ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed based on the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments for the sake of sharing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that enable society and relationships , rather than lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
this project has already been started in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul . many parking spaces that belonged to the government were
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were given to people whose children had moved out . incub@@ ator programs were launched ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . through our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host today .
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was a lot of hospitality before .
similar websites existed before us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that with the components of confidence we can find the right design .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da drive past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the check @-@ up check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
people are probably not talking to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a fitness sports@@ woman ,
and I am a spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born that way .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ st me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a declaration of independence to me , in contrast to the pressure I felt as a 17 year old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Quran .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever felt that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had finished breakfast , looked up on the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should one do such a thing ?
I switched to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Ne@@ ar ancest@@ ry ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it is not only my country that has been attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a suspect .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember -- as we drove sil@@ ently -- as deeply moved into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims .
we went this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be bl@@ am@@ eless . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings were : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims , dra@@ gged and sm@@ ashed .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the accus@@ ations that are hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when will we go ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only kept under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less , because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make America more secure ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but not stopping the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more tolerant approach to people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington D.@@ C. area recently told me that people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or bed in front of a computer .
when first , the person is cut off from her community , even from her family so that the extrem@@ ist group can make bra@@ in@@ washing , which leads to the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop people from going to the mos@@ que . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group , like the IS , establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when you cast a glance at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke , sil@@ enced her and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that made sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution .
this ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its community .
instead of acc@@ using her of anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept them from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consuming of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that if test persons are reporting messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood against Muslims f@@ lowed up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to ero@@ de the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we might feel it the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the assignment of collective debt is not just about decl@@ aring itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the dental Faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was ba@@ ff@@ led and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when was such an experienced young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or stayed at home safely ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we decided for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we were silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took it out , pulled out my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw made me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or will you join those who think that we are better than the ones ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what tell those who might say you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a ment@@ or with a drau@@ ght , working in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive . I am perfectly normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as permitted .
looking at Muslims all over the world , and I did it with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am no exception in any way .
when humans appear as an exception to rule , then the rule has often been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for ba@@ star@@ ds is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air @-@ parcel delivery entered our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft engines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks . a few years ago they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting to each other , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors in order to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
an aircraft that tries to hit two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most Star@@ r@@ whis@@ kers it can float , and thus has great advantages in start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always one down@@ side .
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter what position the optimal position reg@@ ains and the performance can be improved by practi@@ sing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions , which penetrate to the core of the matter .
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled flying machines that had only two mo@@ ve@@ able parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
we recently discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically most remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross rods , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly steady , and move around in the space .
however , it does not have the elegant rear star@@ ters &quot; elegant algorithm . to make it fly , I have to throw it right .
the probability of throwing it right is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in vi@@ gil@@ ance , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s take a look at that .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller drops out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if restricted .
we will demonstrate this by making one half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we accepted standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the very safe machine over there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for types like us lies the wage in development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that creative , smart creatures are allowed to shape them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes orbit@@ ed each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy . they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy .
this short moment they lit more bri@@ ghtly than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally talk about black holes .
the whole energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
in the first place , we arrange events tempor@@ ally .
1.3 billion years ago , a number of cel@@ i@@ ac life was created on Earth .
since then , the earth has brought about some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is standing up to us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of the Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
they thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the subsequent period , the precision of lig@@ o could be increased significantly , which greatly improved detection performance .
so now you call him Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to solve some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ di@@ ating black holes heav@@ ed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my death @-@ sick father .
basically , these were the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been examining gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes for 23 years . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a wave of gra@@ vit@@ ation is a ri@@ pple in the structure of space and time .
when moving the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and moved into the other .
for illustr@@ ative purposes , lec@@ turers in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often perform a truly repent@@ ant dance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched and stretched at the arrival of the waves . the expansion of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the Lig@@ o staff for crazy .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . that &apos;s grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
with sounds this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 metres .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
about the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now is Alice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob is interrup@@ ting her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can do with them no simple pictures of objects in space .
but by observing changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
to listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , cir@@ cling simply : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies turn very fast , one hears the same p@@ ine@@ apple with an additional key change . this sounds like wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget , Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; somebody who knows what to listen to , recognizes this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with a 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the bars of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know that because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent significance of Lig@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lig@@ o is pav@@ ing a completely new way to research the universe , as it has never been possible before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this way we can listen to the All and hear the In@@ visible .
much in space we can -- virtually or fundamentally -- not see .
a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about everything from them .
the exciting physical processes , however , occur in the nucle@@ us , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through as these are opa@@ que .
the Big B@@ ang : I &apos;d love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own glow .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back at the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that there exists in space that we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o monitors them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the no@@ od@@ les for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of what is happening in space , the gen@@ esis of the stars and ultimately on how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build magnificent detectors and listen to the sound and sound of the universe .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you are dre@@ aming with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start with the show game ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , my fear removed .
my fear to keep talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my life
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected form . it started with a question of my smallest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; babies , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
that Yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on , I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me to do so . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , bring you to life .
dream job .
no .
I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I produce TV .
I make TV , in great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
four television programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows simultaneously are in production .
each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars tv , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts that simultaneously are in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series are running one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself and not only produced , so still overhead . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is doing this ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you &apos;re running a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work so you understand that I &apos;m not just walking around the computer and fan@@ ciful , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming at a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m en@@ gros@@ sed in my work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I put troops on , as if I painted on a canvas .
that &apos;s how you wear a high sound , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever .
many people assume when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing is a joy to me .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I began working and working on TV production , when I began to work and work , build , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy .
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t strive to great@@ ness differently .
the feeling of not being different than aiming for size doesn &apos;t matter what price .
this is called bu@@ zz@@ ing .
or perhaps it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
maybe it &apos;s genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only know that I am not made for failure and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just want to tell you I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask it into question .
to make it clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more work there are , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this bu@@ zz@@ ing . I love the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I need the bu@@ zz@@ ing . I &apos;m the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
am I only this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burnt out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their m@@ um is one stit@@ ch .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby ti@@ ters .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz@@ ing ceased .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine spe@@ eded up .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the bu@@ zz did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ anic work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked out weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan not asleep , does not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz@@ ing .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show titanium ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz I was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so what do you do when what you do , the work you love suddenly f@@ aded away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re working , you love what you &apos;re doing , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you a bu@@ zz , when you know the bu@@ zz@@ ing , and knows how the bu@@ zz feels when the bu@@ zz is stopped , who is it ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to all and secondly , she did not call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my bu@@ zz is be@@ aming , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding , because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the bu@@ zz , I can &apos;t do anything except watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I created , the marathon which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl releases in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity everywhere .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is coming back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz@@ ing .
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the working environment , the titanium sum , that &apos;s just the replacement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sum ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the false words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
it is a law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the bu@@ zz again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not to me in such a way as working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer working at the workplace than at home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to work than at home ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , yes , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not too relaxed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we rush around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst into soap bubbles .
I mostly feel stiff , absent , and confused .
I always take my phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live and the bu@@ zz of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I wonder : why have we ever stopped playing with games ?
you can also ! say yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones don &apos;t want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
and when my teen@@ age daughter speaks with me for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , there is no need for more .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track , even on a bad mood !
15 minutes on the track !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children get ready .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my fe@@ el@@ essness , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz@@ ing , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I will fail and I won . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan at training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more .
15 minutes on the track , why not allow yourself to take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the bu@@ zz of love .
the sum of labour is part of me , but only a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s sn@@ ub@@ bed to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan playing trip to Jerusalem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said yes to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my brain is still working . my camp@@ fires are still burning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high clay , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the other , the correct sum : the sum of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz@@ ing , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of being in me spreads . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I &apos;ll catch you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability for self @-@ healing .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical procedures .
they are certainly one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; an electrode is im@@ planted in the brain to influence the circu@@ it@@ ry of neur@@ ons in such a way that neuro@@ logical functions are improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
you have to imagine that brain @-@ brain trauma is swelling up the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure rises .
in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull .
for this you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to use Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyse brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
being able to grow cells from a tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
it is necessary to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded .
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
you may still know from biology lessons that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but it beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations of brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
one thing is clear , however -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and they then mark them in color to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step , we reim@@ plant@@ ated them at the point of departure of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplantation - Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we reim@@ plant@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reim@@ plant@@ ate the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario , we reim@@ plant@@ ated the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and reim@@ plant@@ ated exactly the same cells , and now the cells remained intact -- they grew into mature ne@@ on .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ plant@@ ated .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we have in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets from one tray .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor motor in the mot@@ oric cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen in people , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side you see the monkey , who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before the injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
see now , when we reim@@ plant@@ ated the cells : the same monkey , two months after the stimulation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant it in humans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , it &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can &apos;t need it . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these types of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get the permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years will it take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first of all , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study .
first of all , you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake to look at them as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as an imm@@ utable entity .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
democracy in fact d@@ wind@@ les with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I became un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sur@@ ging friends who repeatedly said that democracy would abol@@ ish if it would change anything .
at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for true democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save us democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sible democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies will bri@@ gh@@ ten our future , and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the subject of waste I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the twin @-@ summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt , which th@@ rows its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which is part of the wealthy econom@@ ists and corporations , but who are too anxious to invest it where it would be productive and income with which one could bear the mountain of debt and also produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro area , in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rails , equipment and so on and so forth .
$ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion sounds after a lot of money , until you compare it with the $ 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time circul@@ ate in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing except to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which do not compensate for the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ant sal@@ aries , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in an endless loop , advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , in which they do not invest .
un@@ intentionally cause the circumstances that cause the body to kill him .
this is my stri@@ fe with capitalism --
his exceedingly lav@@ ish kind . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
of course , Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on the basis of these exclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive thing about Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was that it with@@ drew the poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive which gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same wei@@ ghting in questions of state interests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted long --
like a candle that shines bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burned out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in ancient Athens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was concentrating on free citizens and strengthening the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
the liberal democracy only emerged when a complete separation between politics and business was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- thus the world of corporations - became a more democratic zone .
in our demo@@ cra@@ cies since the time that this separation between politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , in that the economy gradually desc@@ ended politics and dis@@ ma@@ iled it .
are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because nowadays one can be in the government , and still not in power because the power of politics is stran@@ gled into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my stri@@ fe with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of predat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably depl@@ eted the animals from which it feeds , that they end up star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is related to the economy , which has so far can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ised politics by the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the inequality arises , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash from their companies .
the more successful capitalism disp@@ els the &quot; demos &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring back politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is , by the way , no new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not fare very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens by a miracle , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as business and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste of sub@@ lime , and social conflicts deeper , like it -- soon as I think -- in countries like China will come .
so we must res@@ h@@ ape the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and make sure we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; Matrix &quot; or by something similar to the &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; society , in which machines are serving people and integrating people their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations with the purpose of life .
I think we can be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples .
in the area of companies : please imagine a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one place to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income deri@@ ves from capital and from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ taken .
no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work therein , and employees who work there , but who do not belong to them . no more exchange between capital and labor , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifted twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy : please imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all of humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; into units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the 1944 Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have it , especially against the background of a re @-@ united politics and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is also a liberal in which it prefers privileged persons , and Marxist because it will bury the separation of capital and labour in the bin of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , global Key@@ n@@ esian .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers described as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am perfectly confused .
BG : actually , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you are not confused , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have clearly said what you think of the West &apos;s view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large amount of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a totally democratic zone .
in some ways , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to England of the 19th century .
for -- Rem@@ ember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now acc@@ uses to do what the West did in the 19th century itself , sm@@ elled tremend@@ ously according to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only Greece but the Eurozone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely , to say goodbye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and ongoing denial that a massive fault line passed through the euro@@ zone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- which by the way was the first proposal that revealed this denial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European group , still have elected denial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to keep an economic system that is not capable of surviving by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it will be possible for a while to delay , but when the change occurs it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you fores@@ ee ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- serious ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt range at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
they merely wanted to bring our government down because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that were running through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worse than during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one from the tro@@ ika who imposed this policy told us : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you still seem to be pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hic for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post@@ modern 1930 that appears to me , it will be equally detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you will be wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most of them have never heard of Roy Price although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy had met three years ago .
Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
Amazon &apos;s TV production company .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a hair@@ dresser and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for picking up the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t pick any one .
he has to find shows which are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are quite right on that corner .
this curve is the valuation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows get this assessment .
if your show is evaluated at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the turn .
Roy Price does not care to get to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to support &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average pa@@ yout , average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he has to make sure he &apos;s really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon makes such a thing , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone for free .
and if Amazon gives out stuff for free , one gets to it , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know they will be watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ps or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and hence the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this turn is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7,5 -- a bit above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show with data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager of program design by Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked at the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the ratings they give the shows their course , what shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x made a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this corner . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , now the question is : what is happening here ?
one has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic says somehow that it should work with everything .
when you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work that way , this is something frigh@@ tening , because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here in the US and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company will be used to determine whether or not a dis@@ miss@@ al is made .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies is incorrect .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it can for@@ et@@ ell out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way , by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature .
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year around year , until it suddenly ceased to work ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this once again was a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the journal Nature .
even the data most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these mistakes , data stream rapidly into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very clever people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years , I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you basically need two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its components , so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a branch , put the items back together to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and assemble again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to re@@ assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , why they wouldn &apos;t have been able otherwise . but the decision how to take all these parts together again and make a show like &quot; house of cards , &quot; that was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were competing for TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what the data says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data begin to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and to not forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions with a ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I &apos;ll get it out later with a technical demo .
I have made some decisions in my life so far , and I should have listened to the ball in hind@@ sight .
but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball becomes smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions to be an expert in what one does , and risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
