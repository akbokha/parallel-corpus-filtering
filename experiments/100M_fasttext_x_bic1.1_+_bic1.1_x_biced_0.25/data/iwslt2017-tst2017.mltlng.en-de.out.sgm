<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone of Edward Snowden had heard, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally listened to phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed over designs for a nuclear bomb to Iran.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter didn't like at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years, the government has identified Risen and called upon him to name his supposed sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn Whistleblower and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media has the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the courageous ones whom they do not give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government tied up with Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived at risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had stated for years that it would be essential in their case, the government's demands were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of separating and calculating Risen, this could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly apprehended his telephone call," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit agreement, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">Amid this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and riser of supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers in his attempt to protect whistleblowers, but instead, justice served more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since 11 September, almost every article about national security was the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional complaint because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">They can do that from the moment they are in contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that didn't exist as Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source editing system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet celebrity, which was originally developed by us, Aaron Swartz, and has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot obtain more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that jeopardize us all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have the possibility of making misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about grievances in the supply of soldiers and reports of overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker who strikes the alarm for the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were sent from news on a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm, based in Panama.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to firms like the mosabean fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a trail of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads through a close friend of childhood days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortunes in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by a few to hide and disguise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people this whole world seems very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these rules.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans who were present in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now it's not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mosaken Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some U.S. countries you need less information, need less information to start a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Fraud has allowed cheaters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring a suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we really shocked us that all to one lawyer made suggestions as to how he could transfer his money." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money for it. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's not about a single top politician involved in a scandal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very pretentious as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a borrowed optimist, I can see that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "over the past few years we have seen suggestions for more transparency regarding the owners of companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has gathered in central registers on a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind it.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties introduced a draft law in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseudo-firms." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "" "" "we need managers in the economy to get up and say," "" "" "" "Intransparency is not good for business." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this type of intransparency." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "together we can finally end the intransparency which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was almost abducted and landed in the boot of a red car.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stood still and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. then he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he excitedly told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was getting late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "" "" "he made the whole thing even worse:" "" "" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "" "" "and I thought," "" "" "" "Oh, man!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land kidnapped in the luggage compartment of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "" "" "then I heard say," "" "" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "" "" "a voice in my head said," "" "" "" "How please?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what did I get there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "" "" "what if he is mad?" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, sneaked at tithes to the door, and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold as strangers to me in childhood were actually friends who only waited to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate vacillates and the rent is increased." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I believe creativity can create fear into fun." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and breakfast each morning.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could simultaneously find new friends and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blepharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves to the investors: "we want to create a website where people post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when a visit comes over.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite strangers to stay overnight with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "this will be the next big thing!" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to light.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still very consoled would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you will concentrate on the things you can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to build trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of which degree of trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet touch of panic you're feeling now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they spend the night somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores's cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please proclaim on Twitter that he is candicated for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour had first presented himself with his name; if he had told whence he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say: "he really can hold on very well-locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to release your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought out feedback system reinforces confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their convictions before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we studied how likely it is for people to trust each other, depending on how similar they relate to age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust most of the people who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by appraisals.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three judgements, nothing will change.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stands out for common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted likes.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you are priced.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "" "" "if you talk too little, such as" "" "" "" "hi!" "" "" "", "you will not get an answer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "" "" "you tell too much, for example:" "" "" "" "I have problems with my mother," "" "" "" "-- -- the request will not be accepted." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "" "" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, for example" "" "" "" "Tolle works of art in your apartment! I do my family vacation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to reject these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us business is just going very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were unlawful partying parties or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">The hosts took guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project, I worked in the customer service department. all phone calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than these calls. it's hurting if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that was heard in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million mediated nights had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people have confidence in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, wonderful things can occur.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay where he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "perfect house for travellers who are prone to heart attacks due to sedentary activities." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who can save their lives even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You ride one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay goes off.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I first stumbled across this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing reconcile with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's about economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "" "" "but to call it just" "" "" "" "rental industry" "" "" "", "the thing will not do justice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling was a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visited, a group there would wait for a group there to fill a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood of a pub, of which you've never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed based on the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments for the sake of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable society and relationships, rather than loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">This project has already been started in South Korea's capital, Seoul. many parking spaces that belonged to the government were</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children had moved out. incubator programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the share economy. through our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host today.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was a lot of hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">Similar websites existed before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that with the components of confidence we can find the right design.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drive past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this big influence, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the check-up check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">People are probably not talking to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>

<seg id="279">I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted, and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>

<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">Later, after my marriage, I had a child and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had finished breakfast, looked up on the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "Near ancestry..."... "Jihad..."... "bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country that has been attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me into a suspect.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember -- as we drove silently -- as deeply moved into my seat, and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We went this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said: "be alert," "Be careful," "Be careful," "Stay in well lit areas," "Don't be blameless."</seg>

<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>

<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only kept under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>

<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When first, the person is cut off from her community, even from her family so that the extremist group can make brainwashing, which leads to the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people from going to the mosque." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>

<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke, silenced her and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that made sense to their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection to God and its community.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing her of anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept them from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consuming of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that if test persons are reporting messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood against Muslims flowed up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>

<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we were silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took it out, pulled out my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw made me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for bastards is about to become a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-parcel delivery entered our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft engines at the Frac Centre in France built a six-metre-high tower of 1,500 bricks. a few years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting to each other, flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to operate autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors in order to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "" "" "external commands are available at the highest level e. g." "" "" "" "start" "" "" "" "and" land "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">An aircraft that tries to hit two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most Starrwhiskers it can float, and thus has great advantages in start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always one downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter what position the optimal position regains and the performance can be improved by practising.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions, which penetrate to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots could fly remote-controlled flying machines that had only two moveable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">We recently discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically most remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross rods, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly steady, and move around in the space.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant rear starters "elegant algorithm. to make it fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in vigilance, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's take a look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they need to be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller drops out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making one half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We accepted standard Micro-Quadcopters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The very safe machine over there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the wage in development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that creative, smart creatures are allowed to shape them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes orbited each other in a very far distant galaxy. they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit more brightly than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally talk about black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">In the first place, we arrange events temporally.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, a number of celiac life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has brought about some things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is standing up to us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">They thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work they built the Detector Ligo: the laser interferometer gravitational-waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the subsequent period, the precision of ligo could be increased significantly, which greatly improved detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">So now you call him Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run to solve some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two collidiating black holes heaved through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been examining gravitational waves from black holes for 23 years. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A wave of gravitation is a ripple in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and moved into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative purposes, lecturers in courses on the theory of relativity often perform a truly repentant dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "stretch and dust, stretch and dust." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for example, each of us was stretched and stretched at the arrival of the waves. the expansion of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the Ligo staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than one thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "" "" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "" "" "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it's very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now is Alice" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob is interrupting her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "stupid Bob" "" "</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do with them no simple pictures of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by observing changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, circling simply: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">If the two bodies turn very fast, one hears the same pineapple with an additional key change. this sounds like wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget, Ligo heard the following: [Surrender noise] somebody who knows what to listen to, recognizes this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with a 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the bars of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know that because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Ligo is paving a completely new way to research the universe, as it has never been possible before." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and hear the Invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- virtually or fundamentally -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A super-nova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about everything from them.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes, however, occur in the nucleus, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through as these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">The Big Bang: I'd love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it since the Big Bang is covered by its own glow.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exists in space that we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo monitors them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the noodles for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different view of what is happening in space, the genesis of the stars and ultimately on how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build magnificent detectors and listen to the sound and sound of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">You are dreaming with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "" "" "for a year I would say" "" "" "" "Yes!" "" "" "" "I was afraid of." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start with the show game?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, my fear removed.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep talking, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "yes," "" "" "" "my life</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "yes," "" "</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply, to an unexpected form. it started with a question of my smallest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "" "" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "" "" "kittens" "" "" "" "for inexplicable reasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "babies, I need milk for my beak cup." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">That Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on, I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me to do so. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm a writer. I think things out, bring you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make TV, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows simultaneously are in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars tv, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts that simultaneously are in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series are running one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself and not only produced, so still overhead. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "" "" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "" "" "author" "" "" "" "falls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you're running a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work so you understand that I'm not just walking around the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreaming at a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm engrossed in my work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I put troops on, as if I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">That's how you wear a high sound, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could go on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing is a joy to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I began working and working on TV production, when I began to work and work, build, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzzing is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the sum is God's voice in my ear." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can't strive to greatness differently.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than aiming for size doesn't matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I only know that I am not made for failure and I only know that I love the buzzing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to ask it into question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make it clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more work there are, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzzing. I love the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzzing. I'm the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overhauled, overloaded, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mum is one stitch.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "" "" "and Emerson says:" "" "" "" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titers.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzzing ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine speeded up.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzz did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titanic work, 15 hours-days, worked out weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a Titan not asleep, does not give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show titanium,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I was the buzzing and the buzz I was." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when what you do, the work you love suddenly faded away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "" "" "I know some may think:" "" "" "" "Heul, stupid author-titanium." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you're doing it, you're working, you love what you're doing, being a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you a buzz, when you know the buzzing, and knows how the buzz feels when the buzz is stopped, who is it?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "" "" "and then my" "" "" "" "southern" waitress "" "" "" "" represents me a question. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "" "" "I am on the way out, late and she says," "" "" "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "" "" "first, I have to say yes to all and secondly, she did not call me" "" "" "" "kitten" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "" "" "she calls no more" "" "" "" "kittens" "" "" "". "" "</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and my buzz is beaming, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "" "" "she says," "" "" "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "" "" "and I say," "" "" "" "Yes." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding, because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of the buzz, I can't do anything except watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl releases in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not right away, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is coming back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the buzzing, the working environment, the titanium sum, that's just the replacement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and TV hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzzing is the stream that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sum ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the false words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is a law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the buzz again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not to me in such a way as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this admission is painful, because what a person prefers to work than at home?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="731">We rush around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst into soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I mostly feel stiff, absent, and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live and the buzz of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why have we ever stopped playing with games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! say yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me naive, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they're not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones don't want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And when my teenage daughter speaks with me for 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, there is no need for more.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track, even on a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the track!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no clothes, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children get ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my feelessness, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the buzzing, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you're doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I will fail and I won. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan at training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the track, why not allow yourself to take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzzing came back in my spare time. the buzzing seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzzing, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzzing, the buzzing is not me... no more.</seg>

<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They are certainly one of the most well-known, the "deep brain stimulation." an electrode is implanted in the brain to influence the circuitry of neurons in such a way that neurological functions are improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffering from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that brain-brain trauma is swelling up the brain and the cranial pressure rises.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to use Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyse brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Being able to grow cells from a tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">It is necessary to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">You may still know from biology lessons that stem cells are immature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but it behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations of brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then mark them in color to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we reimplantated them at the point of departure of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation - Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reimplantate these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplantate the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we reimplantated the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and reimplantated exactly the same cells, and now the cells remained intact -- they grew into mature neon.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimplantated.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we have in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we injured the motor motor in the motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkey, who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance before the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now, when we reimplantated the cells: the same monkey, two months after the stimulation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant it in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, it's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know someone who can't need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these types of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get the permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years will it take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First of all, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First of all, you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it's safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake to look at them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an immutable entity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Democracy in fact dwindles with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I became unequivocally clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my surging friends who repeatedly said that democracy would abolish if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defensible democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for without democracy our societies will brighten our future, and our great new technologies are wasted." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "" "" "I call it the twin-summit paradox." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is part of the wealthy economists and corporations, but who are too anxious to invest it where it would be productive and income with which one could bear the mountain of debt and also produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the euro area, in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, rails, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">$3.4 trillion sounds after a lot of money, until you compare it with the $5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time circulate in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing except to inflate the stock markets and raise real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which do not compensate for the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnant salaries, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, as in an endless loop, advocates the pessimism of investors, in which they do not invest.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally cause the circumstances that cause the body to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my strife with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His exceedingly lavish kind. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial to the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, Athenian democracy included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of Athenian democracy on the basis of these exclusions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about Athenian democracy was that it withdrew the poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive which gave them the right to political co-determination with the same weighting in questions of state interests.</seg>
<seg id="935">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Athenian democracy hasn't lasted long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines brightly, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, our present liberal democracies have not their roots in ancient Athens," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While Athenian democracy was concentrating on free citizens and strengthening the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy only emerged when a complete separation between politics and business was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- thus the world of corporations - became a more democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our democracies since the time that this separation between politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, in that the economy gradually descended politics and dismailed it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because nowadays one can be in the government, and still not in power because the power of politics is strangled into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my strife with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that sustainably depleted the animals from which it feeds, that they end up starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is related to the economy, which has so far cannibalised politics by the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the inequality arises, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash from their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism dispels the "demos" of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring back politics and economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, as in ancient Athens, except for the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is, by the way, no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not fare very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens by a miracle, without creating new types of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as business and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste of sublime, and social conflicts deeper, like it -- soon as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must reshape the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and make sure we are democratizing the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" appear like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "Matrix" or by something similar to the "Star Trek" society, in which machines are serving people and integrating people their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long conversations with the purpose of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: please imagine a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one place to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income derives from capital and from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work therein, and employees who work there, but who do not belong to them. no more exchange between capital and labor, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifted twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: please imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," into units of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "today we have it, especially against the background of a re-united politics and economy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is also a liberal in which it prefers privileged persons, and Marxist because it will bury the separation of capital and labour in the bin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we do that, technological development will generate such a massive decline in macroeconomic demand, which Larry Summers described as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am perfectly confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not confused, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have clearly said what you think of the West's view on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large amount of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a totally democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I can say so provocatively, China is similar to England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- Remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now accuses to do what the West did in the 19th century itself, smelled tremendously according to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Most of them have never heard of Roy Price although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy had met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">Amazon's TV production company.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a hairdresser and describes herself on Twitter as "Movies, TV, Technique, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for picking up the shows and content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't pick any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are quite right on that corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the valuation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows get this assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is evaluated at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where after watching a relay, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not care to get to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to support "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the average payout, average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure he's really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time Amazon makes such a thing, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives out stuff for free, one gets to it, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they will be watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skips or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "" "" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and hence the answer, and this is:" "" "" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican US senators." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this turn is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7,5 -- a bit above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show with data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager of program design by Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the available data about the Netflix viewers, so the ratings they give the shows their course, what shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom about four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix made a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this corner. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, now the question is: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says somehow that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work that way, this is something frightening, because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the US and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company will be used to determine whether or not a dismissal is made.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies is incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it can foretell outbreaks of flu, the bad way, by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the journal Nature.</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year around year, until it suddenly ceased to work,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this once again was a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the journal Nature.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes, data stream rapidly into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years, I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you basically need two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem into its components, so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a branch, put the items back together to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and assemble again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to reassemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, why they wouldn't have been able otherwise. but the decision how to take all these parts together again and make a show like "house of cards," that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they were competing for TV ideas, then as they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "" "" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "" "" "that's what the data says." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things are going wrong when data begin to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and to not forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions with a ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll get it out later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have made some decisions in my life so far, and I should have listened to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you want to replace them with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball becomes smarter and smarter. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions to be an expert in what one does, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
