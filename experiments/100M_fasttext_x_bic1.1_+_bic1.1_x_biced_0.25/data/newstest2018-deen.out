Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people should meet today .
a pit chapel , which is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers are cultiv@@ ating the ru@@ sty ground of farmers .
Munich &apos;s oldest official map promotes exciting stories to days .
it &apos;s annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this , who had to get upset because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a stra@@ pping road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bayern of the State Government , are anything but current - but that is why it is very revealing .
especially when comparing them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bavarian at@@ las is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one does not recognize as such .
the large picture postcard has been incorporated into more detailed maps for towns and municipalities , so @-@ called pri@@ mor@@ dial leaves .
these were created according to the Bay@@ erische displac@@ ements Authority , between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 , arising from the first measurement of Bavaria .
your Princip@@ al : Napoleon .
the French Army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops finally with@@ drew from Lun@@ é@@ ville &apos;s peace of 9 February 18@@ 01 , it was today &apos;s neighbors who created the idea of a surface @-@ covering Bavarian map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische veying business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the composition sheet for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and , like all others , can be found on the official website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / today is most impressive on the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , i.e. 18@@ 77 as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 alongside today &apos;s pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser only in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing as fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming in appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; ur@@ anium &quot; from which the property tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small plots are no longer a farmers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but farmers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land in sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the position paper , in the area of today &apos;s district , Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only reads the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the ventilation &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Bad@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked up people with del@@ u@@ sions .
the Munich district Ir@@ ren@@ berg &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ nen &quot; was created there in 18@@ 58 / 59 .
from 18@@ 72 onwards , Dr. Bernard of Gu@@ dden led the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended up selling the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the staff from using violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; said Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients first place had been , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the rotor unit in hair 1905 .
Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts since 2006 .
now young people meet in the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um , Munich , on the grounds of the former inner prison .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
the football field of the TS@@ V Munich east is west , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built - an architectural reference to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ berg , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where this day was the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn race track will take place .
the slider lets you compare the old Munich map with the aerial view today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ mers has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is scheduled to come into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , fast @-@ based incidents occur recently throughout the state and will be noted here , &quot; it says in the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to claim discrimination , as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , prompted the group to issue the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .
the group cited events such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police , without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office showing that black mot@@ orists in the state will be more than whit@@ ew@@ ashed in the state 75 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring money or relatives to travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI secret reporting programme , which classi@@ fies the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th place in the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , following the adoption of immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s view of further retirement benefits .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ projekt is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ fence project is a success project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U member of parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac provided a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties at the legal grave yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted glimp@@ ses into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and as many young animals and accommod@@ ated in five apartments holiday palaces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative for him for the milk of his cows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests only regional .
as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ project as &quot; elem@@ ental important . &quot;
I cannot generate profit@@ ably on such steep surfaces .
the grass@@ land area is for a lot of work , a lot must be worked with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not lead a bio@@ operation .
for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ ay project and is happy about the leaders &quot; support . &quot;
farmers would have to be supported at cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could be dra@@ gged out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to carry on their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasized the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmers are often critici@@ zed for funding because of the promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants .
the surface area is therefore 40 hectares , which must not be aff@@ or@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was supported by a leader , a quarter bearing the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ bach .
thus the farmers left 12,@@ 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of fence @-@ fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ gevity of f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and rural women it is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also Peter Weiß asser@@ ted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regional Care Centr@@ es ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art advancement of wick@@ er f@@ ences .
the aim is to keep the Black Forest open .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a convey@@ ed circulation system designated by the L@@ PR .
moreover , the area to be enclosed must not be tow@@ ed ( inclin@@ ation above 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
eight participants with 24 pitches , who want to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , are currently underway for the Fis@@ her@@ bach Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aune project in 2018 .
the area of disclosure is equivalent to 35 hectares ; the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes up the Statue of Liberty
the most secure sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have rev@@ oked him if he had done it .
but it interven@@ ed , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta was compla@@ ining , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is technically correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contem@@ por@@ aneous resonance of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immig@@ rant , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely , and the w@@ ret@@ ched waste of your rich str@@ ands . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable apost@@ asy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that those people in Tru@@ mp USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they took a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic picture .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus b@@ anded the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great cry of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , ar@@ gues in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone , but rather an early neo@@ conservative , bringing the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not ligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual Lim@@ bau@@ gh came across here .
the significance of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable but hop@@ eful people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships .
it is all about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever recognize .
their torch should not ligh@@ ten the way , but ign@@ ite hatred that is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Scot@@ ties belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member sc@@ ot@@ tish cont@@ ingent of the world championship cad@@ res will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special develops , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that there is something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : there &apos;s something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team to captain of the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete for the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les at their fifth world championships , says it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the medium @-@ distance runners Mu@@ ir goes on this road and last year raised five British and two European records .
it will take part at 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman that was to be observed after a great season , which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also get involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ate voted for me and chose me , it makes me something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
what is my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from being at the Olympiastadion Berlin again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will be simply such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the pre@@ heat of voters
the father of our country knew something from a bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers sl@@ apped him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he kno@@ cked at the cri@@ tique , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and mu@@ te , we are w@@ aged like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work on being more like Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of the beginning of this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has shown a firm hand in the management of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very clever to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum designated as official , and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokesperson , A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real folks who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , not a troll@@ s .
they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and un@@ professional .
the pastor quote the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary range &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are dis@@ regarded by some as a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor said as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; attack would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one had done the same thing , that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical keys or to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators .
but that is exactly what happens digitally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tru@@ mp is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County wounded the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ ent@@ u@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
that shouldn &apos;t be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the Aff@@ ord@@ able Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied in between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck him .
and even at that time Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the ren@@ aissance club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field Links to the En@@ dr@@ unda , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job , when he established that place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous def@@ ender of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour during his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels very special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action on the home floor .
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad about how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates there are 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths per year due to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer deaths per year in Germany due to passive smoking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably near the time , &quot; says the head of the construction station Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections the situation is more complicated than assumed , as there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which is constantly imp@@ eded by construction work , represents a major problem for St@@ ump@@ p &apos;s construction company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are allowed to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were already quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , it does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ rich@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent in the rest@@ less Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a , &quot; directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the stolen tu@@ ber is removed and worn out with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a can@@ opy room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course late to work can be dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many are drinking hard , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ land of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote by a public raising in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , which imposed for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the Province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , including the independent part of Papua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island .
the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive by car .
there is no public transport .
the city , with about 19@@ .000 inhabitants , consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated iron roofs , which were transformed by rust into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ é .
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven Tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst childhood mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esi@@ as Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass Hill , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , some wood resources are valued at $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s most powerful military preserves a sti@@ fl@@ ing presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid nearly $ 20 million local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150@@ ,000 in one officer .
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose and are dealt with mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to milit@@ ants , more than 500@@ ,000 were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 .
Mass@@ ent@@ ö@@ gements in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we Are W@@ ing Every@@ thing , &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric beats are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week incidents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as resources get an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants are coming from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local , who went to work in the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native Papua - the M@@ om mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - tasted its market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ k@@ ovo , promised to tackle the ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua at his electoral campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmer@@ mann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai ) on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts broke because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ o &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in Ost@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they were supposed to turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers accepted their tone and later came back with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their ri@@ fle but@@ t , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was struck so severely that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young girls , women and children gathered in a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial fi@@ sts and introduced the qu@@ ita dance - running in circles and im@@ itating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to throw stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal funk : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official TI@@ ME document that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ligh@@ tenment , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colourful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ amed still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was met three times , his c@@ ousin who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in som@@ bre mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of Papua New Guinea , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were being attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua Police , In@@ spec@@ tor Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ ei@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news about the kill@@ ings only arrived on the following day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it won &apos;t happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Security Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he would judge an extra@@ judicial mechanism for resol@@ ving historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90@@ s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , accused by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; called for more than 1,000 cas@@ u@@ alties in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua have already been settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ m un@@ beli@@ ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the past three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says .
the shooting did not stop .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police fired on villa@@ gers in the neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones to officers who responded to firing a warning .
but local people say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting the crowd and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured here were quickly delivered , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called for accoun@@ tability to the officers involved and withdraw the police from the territory of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a troub@@ le@@ maker for the Indon@@ esian government .
the lack of meaningful development rein@@ forces the dis@@ content of the tribal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the Free State of Papua ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army which claims to defend the rights of Papua by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indon@@ esian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty increases dis@@ satisfaction .
the little bit of rice sold in Beng@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , each of which can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs in the region tend to go to the better educated and more prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Papua , we rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai family council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , the coverage of international media coverage remains ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were ported from Papua with a lack of coordination with related institutions , although the rare permission was given to them for filming .
according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ o &apos;s campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Africa : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s immediate neighbours .
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Foreign Ministry , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , re@@ pu@@ di@@ ated the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local people want more foreign governments to note this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia won another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people probably won &apos;t vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ i , the Chairman of the tribal Council .
he wants Jok@@ o to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; fault &quot; he has to pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ot@@ ers carried out a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the dead bodies of a victim were buried in an area just opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire of the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire occurred on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 metre high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is rightly called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ches tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and when the people scre@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident told his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units fought against fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled down the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from the cl@@ adding , the exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through the general meeting with his Davis Cup Cou@@ p .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the Davis Cup single , which was revolutionary for this sport , was only to be played on two ways of winning , spar@@ sely not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
often very long , but also very much cher@@ ished five @-@ set classics remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only narrow@@ ly missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member@@ ships have not accepted the entire Reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will continue to work to improve the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not until the vote , the proposal had already come to the conclusion that the finale had to be carried out at a neutral location .
only comparatively small details are new from the beginning of 2018 : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the hosting law in the following year in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements regarding training positions etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to take less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items to the aircraft , find out a survey
a survey among air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of un@@ consciously or un@@ consciously forbidden items past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration have passed by , including at least 6 percent that entered the aircraft while they accidentally carried forbidden knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they had accidentally discovered that they had mistakenly jour@@ ne@@ yed with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out at more than 1,000 people - a jet @-@ charter service operated by Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . - also stated that younger travellers would rather dis@@ regard the rules .
those sur@@ vey@@ ed that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with anything that was banned by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent millenni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , generation X members .
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent reported know@@ ingly carried objects with Klin@@ t through security control , while 2.2 percent of women sur@@ vey@@ ed and 3.@@ 7 percent of the respon@@ dents confirmed that they had deliberately banned illegal drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it consul@@ ted travelers all over the country to find out how many accidentally smu@@ g@@ gled goods by airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that the people who are most likely to smu@@ g@@ gled - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry by the certainty of those who fly the most frequently .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they may take with them or how much of them .
it is therefore no surprise that the greatest amount of forbidden liquids covered by the T@@ SA are forbidden .
for a while the people thought T@@ SA could look at books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k willingly shares with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 .
in doing so , he has so far failed that a part of the customers have already pulled back their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed another , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number for the first time when announ@@ cing the latest quarterly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has frequently had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 reservations .
critics have always pointed out that they are only non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom 1,000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation Plan . &quot;
at the moment 45@@ ,000 of such non@@ com@@ mitt@@ al reservations envis@@ age , cleaned mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
according to 2018 , all models should be 500@@ ,000 , and one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are 1,@@ 800 reservations per day .
if you order a Model 3 today , you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines with maximum capacity utilization , never tested in practice .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , if there are any major delays , the non @-@ binding of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA Head P@@ ru@@ itt is reti@@ ring because of dela@@ ying the Obama @-@ Er@@ a &apos;s rules to reduce emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is about a deadline that expi@@ red on October 1 for States to meet the 2015 standards for o@@ zone related to soil .
P@@ ru@@ itt told in June that he would delay the observation by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or ham@@ per@@ ing economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a long time a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or ret@@ ard regulations for the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for P@@ ru@@ itt &apos;s regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply endor@@ ses the willingness of EPA to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previous administr@@ ations , EPA often did not meet the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to be indic@@ ted by groups of activists and others , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority it gives us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &apos; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &apos; to ensure that the provisions &quot; are based on sound policies and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a draft law approved last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measure was not yet voted in the Senate .
the New York Public Prosecutor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of States who had accused the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man .
new York joined in this case California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ie , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources respond to sunlight in the atmosphere .
the resulting smo@@ g may cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and every year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
public health officials and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered upon P@@ ru@@ itt &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to keep this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to address environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescu@@ ing and maintenance of the oldest building in the village has made the friends and sponsors Tum@@ bl@@ ets their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische judgement paper : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church in Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ t@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
in addition to the former parish church , the wording of the document , in addition to the former parish church , was also a beautiful courtyard for which the Church or the pat@@ ron@@ age belonged , and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village image of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; is the third , the majestic settlement centre of the village .
old maps from the period around the year 1600 demonstrate these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval own church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest still remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
this was connected with the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Lar@@ ger of the two sh@@ attered at Christmas in 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed in later during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ary Church was demol@@ ished .
only the bell tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 , a storm split the bell tower and half collap@@ sed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius plant as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organizers invite the friends and sponsors Tum@@ bl@@ ets on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade to the old cemetery in the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel .
this is organised by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann spoke about the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
at the end of the seren@@ ade , a trunk is held in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers put out the fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organisers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of significance for Tum@@ lingen and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ bl@@ gens feel particularly committed to their home care , such as Walter Mart@@ ini &apos;s Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er .
association wants to check approval of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim abst@@ ain &quot; does not see legal requirements for construction and has therefore turned to the Council of the Territ@@ ories .
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim abst@@ ain &quot; has called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there existed a wind @-@ force concentration camp .
in this concentration camp , the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the urban area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind @-@ force concentration camp in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days before - but that had not been approved by the Düsseldorf district government , because of a mal@@ function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval is still illegal and therefore also rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council again approved the wind concentration camp in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; approval by the District Government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the sum@@ mons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have gone into the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to test the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to manifest itself in terms of the argument of the Bo@@ is@@ heim association .
the NEW Re , a NEW subsidiary , is planning to build four each 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area on the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
already last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen particip@@ ates indirectly , had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are property .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of some 11 400 households will be covered - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ sen@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer , Vier@@ sens Stad@@ ler gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .

city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the Gewerbe@@ verein and the municipal administration intend to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to l@@ ure the inhabitants to the shopping spre@@ e in the city centre .
as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend will make the customers aware of what offers their own city has to offer away from the usual supermarket product .
according to this , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies are to present their apprentices@@ hips .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre invite to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mid@@ night shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the action does not only aim at residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend so Christian König .
the municipal administration and the business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
in this way , the Gewerbe@@ verein and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive inner city . &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to the well as well as selling Sunday , talks with all commercial traders and hosts in order to move them into active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential is to be re @-@ developed or re @-@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also lost sight of downtown shopping .
in the end everybody would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city centre - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
the idea of overcoming the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was partly broad@@ cast@@ ed had said König in spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen announced that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day will take part in five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities for the first time .
besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action led by the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment with his purchase behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tru@@ mp put pressure on the border wall after trans@@ liter@@ ation of phone calls in Mexico .
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tru@@ mp asked in a phone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US president was insul@@ ting him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States , and to allow Mexico to pay for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull was also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was convey@@ ed by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p , &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tru@@ mp finished the call after Mr. Turn@@ bull said , &quot; That &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massac@@ res : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer @-@ suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and glan@@ ced through the wind@@ screen .
inside the occup@@ ants flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
luckily this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a night@@ mare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience clas@@ h@@ ed with very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night where two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been ly@@ n@@ ched from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of mur@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman for Georgia and a life of civil rights activists .
for him , post@@ uring serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician places a blanket over the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chen on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI records received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one was ever indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects remain open for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch campaigns throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a Supreme Court decision made it possible for the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time in the summer election campaign .
approximately at the same time as the choice stab@@ bed according to information of the FBI the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they got closer to the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in kill@@ ings , removed evidence and fal@@ si@@ fied the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene conducted the annual reproduction of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her presentation is illustr@@ ative , gri@@ pping , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism , many of whom want to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and still more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we will be confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or listen to what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - came into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ der for years , but he said that the role would never be simpler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ ren Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , who cries out and ur@@ ges him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ ch from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
An@@ cona tells the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people at that time were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to meet the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship is replacing the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time when An@@ cona speaks the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends viol@@ ently and quickly .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed in a dream dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and lets Bil@@ lie Holidays ap@@ pre@@ h@@ end mour@@ ning glory &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about one hundred meters behind , a group of about four dozen people wi@@ pes sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the street .
they all experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you are on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky .
when the last notes of the song come out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name .
children ho@@ ck in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ uring a little boy than he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ch rope and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the clan member has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks through him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you did this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joins the actors for dinner .
at a table chat@@ ters a white couple from Atlanta with a black pair , whom they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words that the performance has left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these horrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you themselves and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today this is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone puts Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his table , eating and remember@@ ing civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reproduction is inspiring in a way , because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ conc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ an in Bay@@ reuth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful and fri@@ vol@@ ous production against a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows optionally a sk@@ imm@@ ed street corner with Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ster and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from East Germany or the New York Stock Exchange .
in front of it , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhine le@@ pers are pos@@ ing as a Rock@@ ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - that goes through its &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already wonderful in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
K@@ ess dec@@ lines her Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , sh@@ edding a cor@@ pse in the luggage compartment in Hollywood @-@ style and giving the Kra@@ ri@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully fu@@ tile Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a wei@@ ght@@ box .
brutal the scene when he was frigh@@ tened by Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe in it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ my , who hum@@ bly bows his hands to Merkel &apos;s r@@ ô@@ le .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual pas@@ sports .
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
in 2013 he had to have another organ of the Pfei@@ f@@ Concert for himself , there were five years later great jubil@@ ation , in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls were sub@@ trac@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner will be happy about this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of what has been seen .
I draw a positive resume .
Max Quanti@@ ty works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where to go everywhere ?
quantity : normally in vel@@ vet at the furniture exchange , once a week I am working here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I worked at school already in the open all @-@ day .
what &apos;s your experience with it ?
quantity : it is a nice , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a L@@ ate Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er .
how does that come about ?
amount : I did a high school gradu@@ ation .
and then a civil engineering study , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
for me , I realized that for me it is fal@@ seh@@ ood and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
do a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , at the point of burning perhaps , really .
and was it like that ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker training and studying at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you make your FS@@ J .
it can be done from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
in a different way than in civil engineering studies ?
quantity : well , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
one always has other people in front of the head , each having a different story behind them .
whether a refugee or a young person who has been taken out of the family - you must always pay attention to it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : for this I am not the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is so .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that they will disman@@ tle more 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing .
the breakdown of jobs , which General Director John Fall@@ on announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , with which 4000 jobs have already been lost .
Pear@@ son announced in May a third cost @-@ cutting program a cost reduction plan by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace to digital learning .
the company , which sold its shar@@ ehol@@ ding to Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House last month , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed at suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and wounded several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured and declared NATO &apos;s declaration .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians were killed in the Q@@ arab@@ a@@ h district .
bombing is the last violence done by Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday suicide bom@@ bers killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ a@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities reported in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July a suicide bomb explo@@ ded at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban claimed they had carried out this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bom@@ b@@ ings in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
violence stresses the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp weighed down the number of U.S. forces supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in Kab@@ ul suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policy and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Dec@@ ision to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ g Ru@@ le After C@@ lay
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , under which States are obliged to contain smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was done one day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the cr@@ ot@@ ch .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to promote the so @-@ called &quot; O@@ zone Reg@@ ulations 2015 &quot; and said it shows the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA manager Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country , in order to define where inc@@ isions have to be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - in order to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and conserv@@ atives who are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EPA web site says that inhal@@ ation of air that contains o@@ zone &quot; can reduce lung function and enhance respiratory symptoms &quot; such as asthma .
common council wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing parties , the municipal council of Flu@@ ence @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decided to set up a joint room in the future sen@@ iors residence .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
it will still take a while before the parish church has so far been owned by the church community , but there is no planning for the project to be done by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total surface of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council are ho@@ vering to see such a common room not as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the community @-@ just housing , but openly into the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget in autumn , will be offset by funding opportunities .
the building is in the renovation area .
according to T@@ j@@ aden , the establishment of a joint room would be condu@@ ci@@ ve to 60 percent of 30 per cent .
the proposal looks to signal the investor that he does not want to throw a bil@@ l@@ ard between his legs in this regard , stating that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers - what is le@@ aning against the environmental construction - as well as the pitch roof - which reduces the pitch and makes the construction more economical .
need@@ less to say , this is not only Wil@@ fried sole propriet@@ or .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the body .
it &apos;s not as easy as the common room .
Daniela Call refers to the many of his own buildings that are not so easy to move forward , but now they lean back to the common room out of the window , &quot; she says : &quot; I &apos;m very hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger does not necessarily speak for the common room - but absolutely against communal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsidies for wealthy or even foreign investors anyway .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is not a surplus , but gets a real counter@@ value in the case of doubt , that is the counter @-@ speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig &apos;s request to split the proposal appropriately , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it remains with two opposing voices in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller sums up : &quot; if we put the decision so , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with car : cyclists are thrown onto the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was hit by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ eth and was severely injured .
as the police hur@@ ried , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg to Hil@@ den on the road .
the Senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
the car driver who was driving in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road , he apparently did not pay attention to the on@@ coming traffic .
he met with a car , which was a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ambul@@ ance .
FC Bayern Munich has to do without the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup is taking place without him : David Al@@ aba has to let the game stand up against Dortmund .
with personnel care , FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory tak@@ eover of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
personnel managers at German football record champion Bayern München are getting bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8.@@ 30 pm / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti should refrain from using the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
the Italian confirmed this on Friday .
in addition , the Mün@@ ch@@ ners Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has bl@@ amed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
walking in the resin of star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Harz , the country &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to emerge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star @-@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to the information needs of many of the Har@@ z@@ ag &apos;s visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athletic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them of stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber come into question .
the information on the boards should be complemented by internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in choosing a location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the turn signal path will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path , the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star more light than another , although it lies far away .
it is also convey@@ ed in which con@@ stellation a selected star differs and when it is best to be seen .
the association runs the highest situated observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with the naked eye can be seen clearly .
in the university town of Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned star@@ base - the planet path since 2003 at the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Church Equ@@ est@@ rian ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to at the end point , degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun , exactly 75 meters away , measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .
while the light from sun to the Plu@@ to needs about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next star star would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a potential show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting pit@@ falls in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated world Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , down the hall@@ way to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko to host the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super fe@@ ather weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ hour world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7@@ pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas observed that a possible show@@ down between fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; recalls Gar@@ cia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I climbed for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so tall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he must move to light @-@ weight @-@ weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fans demand that .
let us give them this . &quot;
and Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound dé@@ but this year to arrange a date next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) that also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell on 23 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed himself openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko gave a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the three @-@ war champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both said they could sense the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top warri@@ ors , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injuries to the tire plane
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost the control of his vehicle shortly before the connection point of the market .
the car hur@@ led right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ took and then remained on the roof in the green strip .
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then traffic on the left lane could be passed by at the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann , after the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , hopes that the optimization of the defense formation will result in Au@@ e points .
Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the first season match , but with the result , there would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to fit better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ part chain is also to be further optimised .
and a gate after a blast , the For@@ tun@@ as don &apos;t want to catch up anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no one will stand alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will get better after the experience in the preparation with the three @-@ chain , than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t yet know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we have the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ize even better and we don &apos;t have to do so many playing errors in construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak of an un@@ decided start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can stand on Sunday with four points and focus on the trop@@ hi@@ es , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach did not want to know about this .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight season days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ mat@@ urely due to an adverse weather .
&quot; now they can start the season almost with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believe that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit more fresh as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a climb favor@@ ites into the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know exactly where they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una &apos;s interior def@@ ender . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland serve as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just because we have the right to get under the top six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is very positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to beat in advance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as Chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to see his players in no case on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ age evaluation tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish For@@ en@@ sic Medical Authority ( Medic@@ inal Medic@@ ines Agency ) has begun testing the tests last year .
they should take a closer look at the estim@@ ation of age during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Service ( Migration Service ) was critici@@ zed for failing to judge the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or earlier , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person &quot; might be 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no major difference in the statisti@@ c of the past few months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the journal The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases where the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers lied about his age .
in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the results published in 5@@ 81 , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in which X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of humans to see if they went earlier or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot confi@@ dently say , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is that if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a heavy concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good in time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Construction Manager at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the government &apos;s presi@@ dency of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , work began at the same time on all three rehabilitation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the construction end is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is confident that the schedule will be kept .
the first bridge coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly re@@ designed .
the two other bridges lead through Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning got a 1.@@ 30m wide and seven ton weight so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a marginal attachment , which is also used as operating mode .
on Friday , a 2,@@ 20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way should proceed .
the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been equipped with the patented bridge caps .
a special feeling of t@@ act has required laying cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , where many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project prior to the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the omni@@ bus in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated in a single lane by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road is completely closed in the area of the bridge at the altitude of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the cost of the three bridge structures is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under Protest in German potato salad
it is not so common for parties to pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to get under a hat is coming together .
the parties represented in the circle @-@ day volcanic Ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) are part of a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on that day because the Af@@ D invites R@@ ond@@ ell to &quot; big campaign opening act &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle .
and conf@@ essed names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forms the leading duo for the German Bundestag election on 24 September , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern , but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Ei@@ fel stays colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the town picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the well square but is now taking place in the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ elles - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the forum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; One World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and one of the major organizers , really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is music and plenty of food , including an &quot; traditional German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it displays presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario hom@@ pes reports about the Af@@ D volcano ice , he has endeav@@ oured to get such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf initially asked for Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there are not enough parking .
now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pe is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it stays peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what it does : at around 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz square , in the Stad@@ thalle there are several speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chair@@ men Uwe Junge .
there are about 200 listeners in the hall , waiting for the top candidate for the election of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy national president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to talk .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now , the officials had a calm evening .
for more than an hour the Af@@ D @-@ event takes place , the guests in the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is hip vac@@ ations shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police can move away - no special incidents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a meeting with the Wolf@@ man Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov solo trump@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo voice of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both combine the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach will sound like in a new gar@@ b , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the play &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz singer N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free playing combine to form a fascinating overall artwork .
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and they will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about their bis@@ exual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was her &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt a bit bitter@@ ly .
in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin ins@@ ures against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I fell in love with everyone I have dat@@ et .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I had played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she especially suffered as &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but at school , when she prefers to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , scar@@ ed and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , they don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to stay in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and maybe some people call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like having to justify myself to the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces he changes the party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening a rally with President Tru@@ mp that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed themselves from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... Today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp first promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he has coal mines in five states , and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party which would rather hin@@ der us than working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the Chairman of the Council , Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel , in a statement to the C@@ BS News .
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the global head of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , commen@@ ded on Thursday what he described as a clear ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed again in sport .
Russian athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin spoke during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics world championships that the exile of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who have won gold and silver med@@ als at competitions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of government @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized for themselves that it has experienced quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships that start on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , announced on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for res@@ etting .
drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
mour@@ ning p@@ act for soldiers crashed in Mali
at a funeral service in the North Hessen District of Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two soldiers were commemor@@ ated by a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
the Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of her specialist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice , which they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the German army in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at mid@@ day only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , of representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens premi@@ er Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the German Army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the mour@@ ning bou@@ ghs came down , the relatives stood arm @-@ in @-@ arms at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the surrounding soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and drive in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann installed the air operation of Tiger Tiger &apos;s Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ich , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this crew could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali showed Prime Minister of the Le@@ yen not : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this is what the Royal House announced on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agrees with her husband &apos;s decision , and she continued to write .
where Prince Hen@@ rik was buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
in 2016 he retired and also took the title &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not regard himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by explained , the spokes@@ woman of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1965 .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
during his later wife &apos;s sympath@@ ies of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik talked about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was swa@@ ying , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the gau@@ ch@@ ises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of social @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for len@@ i@@ ency .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a spe@@ edy re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday the resolution of the parliament spoke out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the unexpected withdrawal of a Green MEP from her state @-@ time fraction in Lower Saxony caused the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to pl@@ unge into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Sunday elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce single @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ west justified her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler will recommend his faction to take it up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the ratio has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is regularly scheduled for January 14th next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , however , holds it essential that the day of the Land@@ tag allows as quickly as possible his self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U will probably decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament day draws trust and chooses a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be examined legally clean , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally assessed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ West &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens called for the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their Land parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we assume , of course , that they have immediate effect on their landing trade , which they have received over the green country list , &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we depl@@ ore El@@ ke &apos;s decision extraordinarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliberately decided not to lead a pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot follow this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of El@@ ke T@@ westen to CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attitude of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Socialists and Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l &apos;s ( SPD ) decision to quickly re@@ choose the country &apos;s day .
the exit of T@@ ern@@ ens costs the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last vanity and her fru@@ stration , her personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty tri@@ vial play and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany discusses the contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal last ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the German editorial team ( R@@ ND ) .
Schmidt , how can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your refrigerator accurately and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if according to all we currently know , a health hazard is practically ruled out .
do Al@@ di now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs from the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
in spite of this , my house has opened up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s concerns .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has just as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and health @-@ safe .
if the residual sugar content of eggs exceeds 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , they are not market@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , the operations are not to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , the production plants do not bear any immediate guilt .
on the contrary , they must expect economic damage due to presum@@ ed illegal practices of service providers .
as always , there are too few controllers in the harvest .
is it missing only on the staff or at the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
precisely for this reason , consistent education of such events and hand@@ ing over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where criminal off@@ ences may be present are of crucial importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm mess@@ ing really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and traffic @-@ ready food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged .
by means of the investigated tool manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ fen@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ food supply animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
at all levels it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all competent authorities that the facts will be resolved swiftly and completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the Football Reg@@ ulations Aff@@ ect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ving to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ obstruc@@ ted expenses of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the executive organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules that were launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can secure the money by signing N@@ ey@@ mar and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , in the face of the financing of the team by the powerful royal family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but they have to counter@@ balance with legitimate income sources that enable them to break even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had incurred huge debt in their pursuit of success , effectively dec@@ eive and ris@@ ked trying to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er affair .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P investment period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen out of favour from the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to sc@@ are off excessive expenses .
&quot; certainly , FF@@ P is not dead and we will further strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause from N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the revenue streams for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by businesses connected with the owners of a club .
while a Q@@ at@@ ari company might sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decre@@ ed that the sponsor of the P@@ SA sponsored by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come on payments by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar in 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar will become World Cup ambass@@ adors and that such a maneu@@ ver could be easily found out for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people who were familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s removal by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of La Liga , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s final ownership of PS@@ G .
arsen@@ al manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga with a state that finances a club .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect financial fair play because one can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor in order to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new source supplier
over the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for the Swiss .
now the close cooperation is at a possible end : the airline signs the contract .
on request from the news agency S@@ DA , Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott made a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
around 17 million small red @-@ white chocolate @-@ boards weighing 14 grams each year distribute the cabin crew before landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ der estimates the order volume according to &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates annual sales of about one billion Swiss francs .
but even more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer , it is a prestigious order .
the Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants have submitted to the new tender .
but only Swiss producers come into question .
according to the newspaper report Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the treaty beyond the spring of 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment .
Swiss chocolate bars have been hand@@ ing out Swiss air since 2006 on board their flights .
prior to signing a contract with Mig@@ ros , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had supplied chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the possibility to place the logo , Swiss launched two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works together with different Swiss cho@@ col@@ ates .
the First Class customers will be p@@ am@@ pered at long haul flights from the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class dry passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i from Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short circuit , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and in Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is also nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &quot; s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( when the thin@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter turned the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like the time is tight .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a talking jar of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool kids who grow up - they still managed to win back the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his grown @-@ ups who are now adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the ration@@ ale ration@@ ale , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
at one point , a character sticks through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy vi@@ cious plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s li@@ pp@@ sta@@ che of &quot; sing@@ les , &quot; whose former big man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
these are the moments of random ins@@ anity that could heat this fran@@ chise like a repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of another type of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its Eastern @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , is to be a bon@@ ded TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are syn@@ ced in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching TV on TV , how Americans might do it with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Open , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
with six long episodes it pul@@ ls away , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; who was edited on a lower length , could deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re better , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything possible for the for@@ age .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Rum@@ anian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs .
strike against Dru@@ gs Ma@@ fia in the country
the police have been hit by the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
at the same time 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials ensured greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
in the case of the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two will probably be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the campaign .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised crime , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany since summer 2016 .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the big effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the aim of the investigation was mainly Italian nationals with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning should go to the bank account .
fashion depl@@ ores large gaps in the for@@ eigner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the for@@ eigner tab in Germany shows substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions in the case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the commission@@ er for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , atten@@ ds large gaps in the country &apos;s central register .
short@@ com@@ ings in the data recorded there could lead to some serious wrong decisions in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , in an analysis presented by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the data , ten million people with foreign nationality are reported in the register , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been adequately maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases data from 1921 was found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the Register any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defective data input can slow backward processes considerably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , in the statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also recognized who would not have to leave .
such false statements , however , &quot; led to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient funds , &quot; states therefore in the analysis .
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have travelled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the paper it says that &quot; BA@@ MF is carrying out such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees of the EU state to reach them first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the reception capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of family guarantees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) believes this promise is sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also return refugees back to the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatened because of the fla@@ ws in the Italian asylum system for un@@ lawful shooting conditions and a danger to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of persons living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach have already provided the blood donation service to other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
all of them Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who with his 100 donations now divided 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , in the meeting of the municipal council , the congregation recognizes a multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome how our bodies are designed for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner under@@ lined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the district manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents .
three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher talked about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K Regional Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
in front of this Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were among the multiple donations and received a prize of 50 blood donations .

the Bank of England will hold the interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after slu@@ gg@@ ish economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensified pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members increased in this month because weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and to 1.6 % in 2018 , and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it sign@@ alled that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected at the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a portion of the mamm@@ oth economic stimulus that was issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of February , although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to be bur@@ dened by consumption . &quot;
at the interest rates it repeated that &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; scale than markets expect .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts corrected down@@ wards for this and next year are forecast for 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell according to these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.@@ 31 and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision not to change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectation of interest rate and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and low levels of wages , as tightening will first get worse before it becomes better .
she added that in the next few years , monetary policy will not &quot; prevent &quot; loss of income , &quot; but she added that wages will recover &quot; significantly at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which is to offset some of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote causing the sin@@ king of the P@@ act .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until it will fully achieve the prices and the economy .
prior to the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rate rose , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months .
the Bank said that the over@@ run in relation to their target of 2 % was &quot; quite &quot; to the weak pound .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decline in swap rates , mortgage markets are likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking sil@@ ently for businesses and want to end the year in a positive manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those who run out the existing deals and fin@@ alize the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) urged to prescri@@ be HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September following a fight before the High Court against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ pre@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , taken before sexual intercourse , can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by about 86 percent , is now supplied by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court uph@@ eld a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the chess move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ pre@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission of infection endangered .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable candidates will be identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be known by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family physician may also opt @-@ in for a possible participation at their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be awarded £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive sourcing .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence on a large scale , taken and implemented in a targeted manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this large new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the biggest health challenges of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , if it is targeted towards needy and vulnerable people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a transaction with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Management Board of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be on the study to be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and delay in implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank@@ ers with a passion for real estate , shr@@ ank from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but creating the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ tain lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it appear longer .
in the kitchen , the reflection is like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important , so when you push the door very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever usage of space and storage , Jo@@ anne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real estate agent will enter a ru@@ di@@ mentary form and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give space its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and which help create an emotional tie in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square footage of something standard into something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a dispute over one of Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s largest real estate markets worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business can be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , brothers have collected 38 real estate in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the family founded West@@ co jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De LU@@ TI@@ S now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - as described by Paul as &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - accounts for about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court case states that this means that Col@@ in has property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul has a value of 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now fight for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , exclu@@ des him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage prescri@@ bes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with affir@@ m@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delic@@ acy shops from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a store in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ an store for the family .
Col@@ in says that he began West co there when he was &quot; in my last years &quot; High School when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on her property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group , with Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars when leaving the company and no Luke 26 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conditions of their financial separation have become bitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ drew very much , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case is in front of the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to dress up and to draw our family name through the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope appeared to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Turkey &apos;s new Chief Executive Officer plans to restrict the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Politi@@ co reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp , including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform track .
here is a piece by re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the hands of the President .
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring their media diet .
President Tru@@ mp &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; when candidate Tru@@ mp was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; said the former election campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to Politi@@ co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ co Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to stick to Twitter &apos;s Twitter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Turkey &apos;s Twitter custom was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
maybe these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know - that Tru@@ mp T@@ we@@ ets without their intervention would have contained more fuel .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp did not send .
if his associates managed to keep him away for a few times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has been able to consistently prevent Tru@@ mp from provo@@ king controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are trying again and again to present their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp materials that could potentially promote their views from the world .
Politi@@ co - engaged in this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers to provide du@@ bi@@ ous information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp like a volcano can react to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and to find out where they come from .
exactly this happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously accused the President of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .

most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped .
in this summer ( virtual ) postcards , police all over Europe send postcards to dangerous criminals on the run .
as the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are naturally not known , indications from the population are hoped for and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action following the Winter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ eting of holiday destinations hide , it was called Euro@@ pol .
21 Post@@ cards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries have been put together .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of the online requests could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them on the basis of evidence after the publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire range &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with a few determined travellers on the war foot , who negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ ors .
travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; Million@@ aire range . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dug by the council to prevent their incur@@ sions .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense posts and pushed its vehicles through a section which remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous occup@@ ant said , &quot; They went there on Monday night after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced into action by shame to implement it because it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travelers were there in May , moved on and are now back again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more came last evening , probably today even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my municipal tax if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of those travelers , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised repository on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to move them forward as quickly as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police , by invo@@ king 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof due to the former Ambiente Company gesellschaft mbH up to the 13th of April 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost , and also income by the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming to the county , the hotel building was offered to the District Council as a collective housing , which ensured controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel .
at the time , the decision was not inevitable in the Municipal Council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel and spoke of serious interested parties at the house .
he was to be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it back into a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , construction sh@@ utt@@ les have been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear how extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors were pulled out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still a lot to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
one doesn &apos;t want to position themselves at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale inner city level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the forest hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set itself wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already held talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s ideas are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to define exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he reck@@ ons just under one million euros .
the exterior installations are also brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible .
a large terrace is created in a courtyard , which is open to the public by the restaurant .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator St@@ eps Grand Jury
in the Russia affair surrounding U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp , special issu@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee received the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calling on familiar people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensified his investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CN@@ N reported that there are already invitations to the committee in connection with a meeting between Turkey &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to have pur@@ pos@@ efully interven@@ ed in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Turkey &apos;s election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation focused on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the re@@ public@@ ans during the election campaign .
according to reports Mu@@ eller took a close look at more and more mps in a private and business environment .
a few weeks ago , the Washington Post wrote that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tru@@ mp had personally moved to the centre and examined the accus@@ ation whether the President could possibly obstruc@@ t the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ists is to examine present evidence in possible cases of crime and decide whether it should be charged .
therefore , Grand Jur@@ ists are also referred to as prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
mostly they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to present persons to interro@@ gate under oath .
according to the CN@@ N , invitations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
those who participated in the meeting had been asked to testify , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. Tru@@ mp Consul@@ tants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former election campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were also in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the exposure show that Mu@@ eller would not in@@ timi@@ date himself in his work and that if necessary he wanted to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the charging of an indictment .
nevertheless , the suspension of the body is the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tru@@ mp .
amid the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y Russia &apos;s affairs as a campaign for its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives the democr@@ ats an opportunity to &quot; feel good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special consultant , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury .
but he also usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any measures that expe@@ dite the work of the special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that he would not be determined against the President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no reason to assume that something has changed in this way , that it was explained in the statement .
Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tru@@ mp had fired Com@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ration@@ ale , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp had become loud , he wanted to h@@ amp@@ er justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June of a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp asked him for a setting up of investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president stands under great pressure because of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to US media , the White House collected material against the special promot@@ er and its employees .
this triggered speculation as to whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller was going to release .
unlike an independent special promot@@ er of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the President of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented bill repro@@ aches on Thursday , after which the special promot@@ er could no longer be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has detached from the S@@ el@@ hag@@ us by the nearly seven @-@ fold size of Berlin .
this was shared by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for Polar and Maritime Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , which weighs over a tri@@ l@@ lion and weighs 5@@ 800 square kilometres , will now travel to the north and will probably need two , three years until it melted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for a human being .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the frac@@ ture of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
in total , however , for some 30 years there has been a series of unusual collap@@ ses in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ Cs ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e .
Sch@@ el@@ event@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e was disturbed by the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rupt a couple of years ago .
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes about a complete disaster .
it seems that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is in danger as well , because the front edge has never been as far back as currently .
in addition , the ice plate hangs under tension and can break down if a piece breaks down at a pi@@ vot@@ al point .
the melting of the ice shelf and the ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is the fourth @-@ largest glacier of Antar@@ cti@@ ca .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the polar plate is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most widespread retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have argued whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e may grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly coinci@@ de , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last for decades .
even if these researchers do not lead the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many glaci@@ ers of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been dis@@ member@@ ed over the past few decades .
this long skirt of Antar@@ cti@@ ca stretches towards South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has also contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees in the last 50 years , thus counting on the areas where the temperature is growing .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f to staff
as it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U calls on the employer to step out of the employer &apos;s association to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , the chal@@ k day has st@@ alled 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now another 17 trainees have finished their first day of work .
the apprentices@@ hips in the district are obviously much sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were registered for the places to be presented this year .
nevertheless , the group lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present there are still 50 vac@@ ant positions in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should develop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term demand for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the candidate gap in a future @-@ oriented way .
the overall concept should be oriented internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and involve an education campaign , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is caused by a high number of employees who ex@@ crete disease or age @-@ related issues from the service .
high time for action , so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the faction of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he took care of a bad surprise already in the day of his work , when he publicly challenged the personnel costs and ba@@ ff@@ led the rest of the parties .
people want to check all the possibilities that permit exit from the local employers &apos; association .
&quot; if we do not come short @-@ term to a satisfactory solution , the district administration with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a house tari@@ ff , &quot; states .
in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials than it actually envis@@ ages the provision for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , elev@@ ations or more money exist only when switching to a higher level which orient@@ ates itself in professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up where employees concerned with the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law .
not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers , Coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hend@@ ele and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone to NGO migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , if they are not allowed to continue with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German relief organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew had effectively co@@ operated with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express itself on the extensive preliminary charges of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge all accus@@ ations currently raised , after collecting all the information and assessing the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are delivered directly from traffi@@ ckers and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s Act , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ riding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must above all have an Italian police officer on board who over@@ sees their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign up , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations was greatly reduced in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine wise bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Northern Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , for which long tri@@ als were rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
again , there was a view point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; f@@ lown &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days , many metres of altitude have been announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the outdoor inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - both sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga matches for e @-@ sport
in the future , the sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles , rather than swe@@ ating through the stadium in the wind and the weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sports has long been a serious industry , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ des included .
these have also recognized the first federal associations which are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 followed the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some clubs will rise on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend FIFA will organise the first &quot; interactive club World Cup &quot; in London , where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified for example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal primarily with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , you could be present online by far more often than once a year to send the federal bond to Asia .
what is it about ?
at the E @-@ Sport , computer games such as League Of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA 3D simulation will be challenged at a competitive level .
as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long since established , in which the pros compete against each other .
and in the 2022 World of Asia , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a kind of sport anyway ?
for many , the performance is certainly getting used to getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has also long been confronted with the question .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sports - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes .
it also requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tactical understanding and rapid response .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but she also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more an issue . &quot;
controls could be elu@@ sive in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing .
in a positive way , the scientist highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of E @-@ Sports .
players are on the road internationally , which is like a large global family , there are no intercultural differences .
a study by Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sports .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be at 130 million .
against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants write .
many countries are already on the ver@@ ge of international success .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez are involved in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the sports bet@@ ting supplier Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot happening in Europe .
in a Norwegian school e @-@ sport was introduced as instruc@@ tional subject , says F@@ rob@@ atic .
in the Netherlands and France , the So@@ ccer League teams are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany la@@ gs behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia to decay and to obsc@@ ure the old times is not enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company in the modern market at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t hold fast that everything stays the same with football as it has always been . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; po@@ isons eggs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
in the meantime , almost all federal states are affected by the sc@@ andal surrounding pois@@ oned eggs .

Michelle Car@@ ter sentenced for suicide by Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend with texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for the neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until appeal .
she was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward @-@ looking eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she completely regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that their &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even their mental illness had a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors read an explanation of Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said there is &quot; no day when I don &apos;t pray the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I feel with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , in spite of all my pain that we will be carrying for eternity . &quot;
Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , testified that she was &quot; persecuted by the realization &quot; that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be an a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not having this single person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to urge others to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed word releases that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , hop on a building , wake up yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Car@@ ter was looking for attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit by any press of the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder at her British room@@ mate in Italy before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a commentary in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ me of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua was allowed to run on the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coincidence .
FC Bayern will give the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a big season - extra motivation does not harm .
something was different from his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ i immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made his bow tie to his arm .
&quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; said the cont@@ ingent @-@ cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bavarian captain .
good , the stall could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from the coach could also point to Kim@@ i .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal had been chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , which was made up of young players , de@@ but@@ ants and just from holidays .
sugar is best distributed to those who want to keep a lot of herbs that you want to keep in your mood .
those who have been chosen to play the legacy of Lah@@ em can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ mich : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old appeared as a mini @-@ lam@@ m over the field .
right behind , this is now his position , the white band@@ age on her arm did the rest .
Kim@@ i worked in this start formation as the one who can take the helm as well .
he gave instructions , tried to steer the un@@ well played tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy themselves .
Vi@@ dal dar@@ ed to beat his missing fitness ( hardly worked ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches with it , on the Devil to get out of the performance of the Asia @-@ trip ( also only partly because of a limited degree ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus did not neg@@ atively fall in their first appearance in the Bayern race .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ ver ran beside Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm often dealt very hard , and in addition , Sü@@ ver tried a few times successfully in the building of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy stated that the result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we have hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a good performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also caught up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bayern world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw afterwards in the game .
Ru@@ dy for example gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good @-@ bye to his new fellow players after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of Sü@@ ver an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he no longer has to teach the new .
Al@@ aba Moti@@ v@@ ates O@@ F@@ B La@@ dies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B women
Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller has reported about Twitter shortly before the game and the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies wish all the best .
the Bavaria @-@ legi@@ on@@ aire is basically club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ captains Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck and fl@@ et@@ ches with our ladies .
the twe@@ et of the Austrian football player of the year and champi@@ ons League winner should be a special motivation .
the famous Bavarian Dus@@ el might also need our ladies well .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sing Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy , Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) , is in office .
Cham@@ bers and companies in the region talk about a change in economic policy on T V demand - and at the same time t@@ ad@@ orn the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing takes up the business wishes that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nat@@ us sees the biggest turn@@ around in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
the ministry is still hoping for a planning process until 2021 .
a role in the country &apos;s plans also plays the western part of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the federal government plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ministry spokes@@ woman Cor@@ nel@@ ia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nat@@ us sees in this a sign to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier , like Von Wis@@ sing , stri@@ ves to promote a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label in wine to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports , which has been bag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people wanting to establish their own company , pra@@ ising the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the passed master test and 2500 euro , if graduates within ten years after the master @-@ training become self @-@ employed .
however , the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction will quickly create facts , at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive officer of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Trier .
of 56 new engineers , who wish to hire Wis@@ sing in the state @-@ run business , only 29 positions have been occupied until now .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices .
s &amp; D vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf added to the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors that the country is investing more than € 20 million less in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country , as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sober@@ ing is the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated the network supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the rating 3,4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
ex @-@ Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the Wind Power Company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she cleaned up the field after four months of in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi is expected to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day prior to the announcement by Audi , BMW said it would offer to update the software to more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW Chairman said the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving constraints , &quot; and thus referred to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support the compliance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des em@@ itting diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ al@@ ising exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles also increases , making it difficult to maintain the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ab@@ using powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called sealing units that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
several employees of Volkswagen have been indic@@ ted in the United States , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and therefore is not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was incorporated into German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been extended .
the inclusion of Audi into the test could heavily burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s gain .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft runs through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
if there is a big raft around the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that is not a common raft with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building department wants to clear up .
a large amount of information is seen on the raft .
it shows a garbage dump .
the kick @-@ off for a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; is meant to shar@@ pen the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a protective game flow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft crossed the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ens and laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most widely published carto@@ ons , the no@@ dule @-@ n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an draws and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he distinguished himself among other things as a sign of congrat@@ ulation - what frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he once said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
the artist of cities had been inspired again and again .
big , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ llo figures ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is still sitting at the drau@@ table , working almost ten hours a day .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for big and small , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , its dro@@ ll figures continue to spread worldwide .
he has also been working on carto@@ ons and a TV series with his characters for six years .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a jack of thousands as a counterpart .
his figures speak for the first time in the 3D film , which should come to the cinema wall in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he prefers to sit on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is in decline due to the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and insect @-@ borne insects , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great headaches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert from the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ci@@ ca@@ y , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there &apos;s a lot in the game .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the town of Gei@@ sa in Thur@@ in@@ gia is celebrating its 1,@@ 200 year anniversary this year .
the highlight of the festival is Saturday and Sunday with a medi@@ a@@ eval festival .

the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the latest may@@ hem in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials , and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and abdominal feelings are sufficient .
there are drug traffi@@ ckers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no resp@@ ite from violence , and while the bodies are accum@@ ulating throughout the country , more and more journalists are in it : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has res@@ igned in December 2012 .
among the latter is Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ us , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , even though his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez that shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hanging on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the 1930 &apos;s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters will discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has initiated only two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of kill@@ ings linked to drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely tried in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ one they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally and although the terrain is now even more tre@@ ach@@ erous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without information about the kill@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the Why , we bl@@ ust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter stopped in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to fly around freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a someone or several people will be shot on the streets every day or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of decorated two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce , was crushed by guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first there was in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival anti@@ trust au@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have upset the sons of suspected aisle runners bought each copy of the issue when it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez to leave the country for its own security following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing was seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he was always there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues for the creation of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce and sold 50 US $ shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters would like to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to deal with .
eight years after Ri@@ odo@@ ce was founded , she received prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever she led .
he gave up voluntarily that he was scar@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ s@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that you think as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce Team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could curse as a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and r@@ att@@ les , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is his love for routine his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells bad , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the publisher of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ us Andr@@ es Vil@@ lar@@ real said , &quot; Sm@@ ell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then things happened with Ja@@ vier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , do not apply to Sin@@ alo@@ a anymore - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen called the governor himself as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce has printed on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known driver Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to government spending , which concentrated on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group in one of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s most expensive restaurants , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor to carry out a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political planes almost all the century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vil@@ lar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this loc@@ ale , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped from a military attack .
just a few months earlier , the readers would have viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; in the past , we had known what happened , &quot; said Vil@@ lar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slim body composition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez p@@ opped a few notes and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist to the Office of the Public Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .
in the whole country journalists have become lou@@ der by having written down on pav@@ ements and buildings in organized protests .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez repro@@ ached the authorities to spy on journalists and put them around because they told the truth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then she has asked her to be re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; by organised crime , government officials involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apparently , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones were standing next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the paper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava B@@ reach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for hazards .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking scar@@ es him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was over , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones suddenly began to h@@ um .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with riv@@ ets and security forces near the seaside resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the cur@@ b@@ ber &apos;s edge , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ us via cell phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens wa@@ its close by - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw glan@@ ces at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were ready .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
Ri@@ odo@@ da@@ ń@@ ski &apos;s employees followed his footsteps amid the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was completely visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you think of closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day that Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , though a frigh@@ tening one .
now researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ er have been preserved so well that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even discover that its sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said it had something of an &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
the report in &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described him as &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the world &apos;s best din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of no@@ dos@@ au@@ r that lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserv@@ ed@@ state surprised researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Radio as he was on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that seemed out of place by the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years expos@@ ing the wild animal within the 2500 l@@ bs ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of severe pe@@ an@@ uts .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only smile a little with your eyes , you can almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the principal author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r examples - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter @-@ coating , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed him to get better into his surroundings and to sof@@ ten his enemies , say experts , indicating that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now exhibited at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli , named after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours in revealing it carefully .
the astonishing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a common method of defense in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs were driven by sufficient pressure by eating meat eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution favor@@ ed the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ r was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors must have been of chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on its life , including its preserved intest@@ ine , to find out what it has eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as Sou@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far more inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ r is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early chal@@ k period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only look a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is asleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when giant ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of wei@@ ghted monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sun@@ k after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Radio , when he was buried on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the world &apos;s best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to hip .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that were ra@@ ging from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous was swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater hull of the din@@ osau@@ r has preserved its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the skin rests still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a gain in the lot@@ to .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
fossi@@ li@@ zed remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales at his sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thunder@@ storm : mass Car@@ am@@ bol@@ lage on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening at A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ lage .
there are numerous wounded , mil@@ der @-@ long St@@ ans - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A@@ 8 ) about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ lage .
according to the police , around 17.@@ 00 hrs between the junction places Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , were cra@@ mp@@ ed together .
at first there are no indications of the exact number of injuries .
it was a matter of light to moderate injuries , a police spokes@@ man said .
a large supply of ambul@@ ance vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich , a round ten kilometres long back @-@ sta@@ u formed .
as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reports , it also came on the counter @-@ track to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ gade noted the car drivers license plates , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock a second accident took place on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident scene .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing remin@@ ding you is sitting in the train and sleeping .
or you are immersed in his work and just has an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : mu@@ ff@@ f .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and w@@ akes us up or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ticket inspec@@ ting .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspec@@ tor .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and thus de@@ value the ticket .
currently , a test operation is running on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we will expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available on many more long @-@ haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train ticket de@@ valuation without conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements need to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which is what most passengers do anyway .
it is also necessary to have access to the app of the train , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of booking your ticket anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you step into the train , call up your ticket at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customers will then receive a button for the electronic evaluation .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and occupied the booked seat Y .
if the train atten@@ dant is at number Y at the ticket inspec@@ tor , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , keep on working , keep silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train atten@@ dant , check out the DB Navig@@ ator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their journey more personal in the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr AG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who travel often know that in addition to delays and missed train tickets , ticket inspections are among the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances .
because often you have , in any case , one of the contribut@@ ors not all the documents you need for validation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to prove .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or greater space and delays in controlling one &apos;s ticket and taking the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen trains .
other newcom@@ ers on the same track are not un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken up to its core .
only one day after arriving in New York City , the one in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment they rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post from someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police just killed an 18 year old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ad@@ ored on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ eten the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body hanging out on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she stopped her mobile phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people crying , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who bore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed in which a polic@@ eman standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his ri@@ fle and scre@@ amed : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Fer@@ rel@@ l to her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and cried . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11@@ pm , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11th .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and power that exists from the point of view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown , the two talked a conversation that they had &quot; about the black experience and the black condition countless times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to get rid of ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ indictment of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , was the President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything has come . &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration on Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , Fer@@ rel@@ l met one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r only wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
a question came from Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of white people in a community benef@@ iting from their pain and their resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other natives , the team of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets followed suit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we talk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community coming together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life , as she falls in love with her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understand that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and for the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black women , gay women have to bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; at which Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront , because in a life on these crosses as a black gay woman stands so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras have long disappeared in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels bound to this memory , since she went on the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers will discuss bit gallery
the Bit Gallery moves people even though it hasn &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian area divi@@ des the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the subject can hardly be cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a human being &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build a gallery to attract more customers to the city , including the rest of the shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian prec@@ inct then ble@@ eds .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the Far@@ mers Market Hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work it will be concluded .
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a Mark@@ thalle into the new building - to the Bed@@ a place with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Zimmer : &quot; for many years we &apos;ve been buying almost weekly in the Far@@ mers Market Hall .
chi@@ ef@@ ly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women happy again and again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
there is also this in other cities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing will settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping list in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved .
after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mainly offered directly by the producer and is also cost @-@ effective at the top .
as you can see , shops in a shopping mall are only le@@ ased by larger companies , because the rent there are often not portable for a retailer .
it &apos;s a pity , there are almost no special shops and that which is left of it will disappear as well . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a Mark@@ thalle does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the peasant market hall be built during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the Bit Gallery will eventually come .
or does the ghost @-@ bit gallery already manage to exp@@ el all transactions from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping center that stands empty .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the farmer &apos;s market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown ones , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence after she publicly tra@@ ded diplomatic messages on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A suitable resem@@ b@@ lance ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ wife and ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , like someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , though somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
in prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie in which Mann@@ ing clearly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of its 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and chew@@ ing gum , extrac@@ ting DNA from waste in order to produce a picture of how these people might look .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while they were in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her det@@ ained m@@ use became un@@ equal pen@@ alties which , over the course of two years , exchanged several letters .
they even created a comic &quot; supple@@ mental images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President would transform the judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person .
that Obama actually demanded a few days after the book was published to claim Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome type of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways in order to continue fl@@ aming the rigid divisions that he should actually rec@@ tify .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a specific reason . &quot;
in an artistic statement written down on the wall of the Gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific le@@ x@@ icon of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological ways , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully carry with is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle mentioned above .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she emerges from the discipline of the United States as King @-@ Kong with a free @-@ speaking tan@@ go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they make your speech cold , they have won &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never let your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition in person - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , by their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which gather like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
it was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea as the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for murder
a national human race is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the Cook County Court of Justice .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died 26 after several years .
a common warning system , published by the Chicago Police Authority , states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials got a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the scene , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that they have now been in absence and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man for the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are prepared to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in every way possible . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly requested the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA driving schedule has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the timetable of the WA@@ DA to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t include anything that could cause concern to Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria listed in the list indicates that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on publicly sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got an error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov stated problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one prefers to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , in the wake of the D@@ oping sc@@ andal , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , you were allowed to schedule and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after visiting Moscow &apos;s headquarters in July , WA@@ DA CEO Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli agreed that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di doesn &apos;t sell eggs for now
this was shared by the corporate groups .
it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could not be assumed any health draw@@ back , it was said in the message .
from now on only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ hal@@ ous anti @-@ l@@ ouse test@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ di wants to make clear and transparency at his customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to compete with your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
the answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not mo@@ urn the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has never been consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has called people from the outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ Up Race is on the rise to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring staff engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , provide staff anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years gained with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low tuned results - so that you can drill why .
companies come to see that they must stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you will not be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity after an overview .
the global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 according to the Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber case in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
U@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent companies can send customised &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time , and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that employees can report bad behavior .
and if the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the supervisory board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has gr@@ asp@@ ed regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
if a company is found that treats its employees poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has appointed Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that had previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practices - can be identified quicker and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect shareholders from employment law disputes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 more seriously after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry going online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the agreement of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itter@@ ing secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer &apos;s venture partners and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that owns their voices , and that the work you do is worth it , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In who uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors reach yields if their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a firm do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks staff for your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ fy employees .
&quot; when you ask for 4.000 ideas , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies who have too much left to gather data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , co @-@ workers ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why I should ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after receiving feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re @-@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ru@@ by Tuesday the company always gets new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency you will lose man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it goes to 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus .
some have moved their jer@@ sey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these un@@ char@@ geable minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer classes will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Aqu@@ apark in the morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys over the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 a.m. to meet the already packed schedules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the boys moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ a performed six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they should hold 18 exercises in the course of August . 20 before the beginning of formal playing preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he support the control change of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the many busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on it three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they moved on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end their practices as soon as the camp is finished , which is not an easy task because of the clear sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already cleared a protective net behind a door post .
brother @-@ player should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people there rent a room and then set themselves there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts verification in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false noti@@ fications from third parties and then display their results below the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday said . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to fac@@ tual audi@@ tors who may view results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly remove hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation in German that a review of the new facts will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to the understanding of the stories of fak@@ ten@@ champi@@ ons from third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; related Articles &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce wrong messages .
comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney lived in K@@ ent for 700 years of turbul@@ ent history and is now an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the signature of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expectedly emotional .
&quot; I have only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was lit for the light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , I love archives ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest , I have over@@ rated my welcome @-@ greeting &quot; ) that seems to be all too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke to landscape makers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust got full access only in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards representing what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let everything go their way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an uprising that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &quot; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , who hid the family Dar@@ rel@@ l for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; in which the smu@@ g@@ gler , Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in filled with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen appeared to be quite a Ga@@ un@@ er , always making debt and spending money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent for wo@@ unding ores . &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences
he has spent a two week stay in Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle wrapped in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the cover of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret until Thursday .
at the end of August it will be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action yesterday on the posters at the Chapel of the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they write on their website which was released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in essence we are convinced that as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event , it &apos;s about more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all@@ uring promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she is competing with other local authorities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a medium five @-@ digit amount to its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on retirement and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting no longer took place in the headquarters of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
the discussions took place under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of State , now also the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
these were the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS .
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
chief of staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the coup failed , President Erdo@@ gan fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as an exec@@ utor of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow of God as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; because he had given him the opportunity to &quot; completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the paper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ites in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
on the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the cap ban on female soldiers , wrote the paper .
in any case , the major impact of the army and security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan sent another 7@@ 3@@ 95 servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they listened to their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pressed the power of the military step by step , not least relying on the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan drives targeted an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt to asylum in foreign countries warned that the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; in a few years .
if this happens , such a development could not leave Nato cold .
in any case , in the alliance after pur@@ ge , there is doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes rules for Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media .
he envis@@ ages lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way the US will issue the way citizens from other countries are spending green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ministry wants to race track for race track @-@ shuttle
over the past few months over the future of the race platform sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested - now it should be quite fast .
even before the end of the year , the route on which the tourist train is going to be built will be built .
in order to secure the future of the race platform sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction work on the track will begin this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to continue to order and san@@ i@@ tise the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Communications Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he estimated the costs for the repair of the route to around € 2.5 million .
of this sum , the country over@@ takes 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , will be fin@@ alised at the moment , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Thur@@ in@@ gia train as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is to be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
the shuttle service is a popular railway connection between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
over the past few months , a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the circuit will be used by a large number of people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also in parts very steep in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should concern ourselves
just as you thought it won &apos;t be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots will come .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger@@ nail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies supply a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the release of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are reached by artificial intelligence .
the user can &quot; adapt &quot; his robot according to his convi@@ ctions and select everything from the eye colour of the robot to the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails .
but it becomes more wor@@ rying as many robots have &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive .
modern sex d@@ olls have become robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot , developed by True Compan@@ ion , with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of timi@@ dity and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compan@@ ion website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
during the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is called here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , uns@@ ett@@ ling one the most .
on his website compared true companion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toy .
their formation and increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something dark and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subj@@ ection as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course have no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R acknowled@@ ges their growing popularity , they remain tent@@ atively on the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the edge areas can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots will emerge in a time where the rights of women worldwide are threatened in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women .
the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the worn @-@ out bodies and the excluded eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as possible ( though with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to put it in the saying of 2017 : ma@@ ids
ho@@ mps great power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human understanding
it has become a tru@@ mp of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp .
we are all preten@@ ding to leave our filter bags burst .
less noted is the power of bringing families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ le@@ aning di@@ ghter who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which she had fought for decades for politics , suddenly and quite stran@@ gely on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it is in a further context that this also involves considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push all of us to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will not rep@@ el us any more .
there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp is &quot; norm@@ alizing re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness .
today I find myself falling from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ comic version of the dec@@ eased - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp are indeed a very mild off@@ ence .
when Tru@@ mp comes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in town , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Parks Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cre@@ aking and the animals twist to look at their own shoulders - extremely glo@@ omy and the music @-@ per@@ ing music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not live up to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is in fact not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ e Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage does not count - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park @-@ car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , since two @-@ year @-@ olds , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ olds go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but thank@@ fully nobody asked him .
on the other hand , this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this is to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to slow@@ ing down what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no one is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts he suffered from the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he had his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ el , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Service said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ meter students from caps and scre@@ ech@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the school holidays and secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes , headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle that grows up in the poultry farm , but is then released into freedom .
to do so , the cheerful flock performed a musical entitled &quot; The Eagle in the poultry farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and had it incub@@ ated by his chickens .
instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of it was struck , the Eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore .
after that , the classes showed a chicken dance three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ bies carrying cylinders to make the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the eagle stands for integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the young animal is different from the other young animals ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ year @-@ old that he felt accepted in his new school .
thanks to the colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps back to teaching positions , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the cu@@ cum@@ ber @-@ time is over now , explained class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
she never divor@@ ced her students after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time .
in the end , she was able to rely on the four @-@ colour people .
at the end all the students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
in doing so , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ people have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , divided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of people illeg@@ ally mar@@ ched in Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
the same day they were released , while currently an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camping and place substantial fin@@ es on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose .
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the Court could impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group offered software updates for a total of some 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission characteristics of cars from the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE car Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates that are tra@@ ded are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers announced a spe@@ edy implementation in the next few months , but not an exact date yet .
Daimler has announced that it will write to each person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done within the framework .
how long will the conver@@ sions take place altogether ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen that voluntary deal@@ er@@ ships do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW company ?
the ACE advises to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would consult , so S@@ met@@ anin .
will there now be a massive drop in the price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but even in regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
in rural areas , no loss of value for older dies@@ els has so far .
the ACE advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J Rec@@ ei@@ ves Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first prize giving under President Tru@@ mp promises to become political . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners will not come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
as announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the honored guests this year .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tru@@ mp will host a reception and join the award with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the prize winner , which was announced with progressive TV series , already announced that he would refrain from participating in the gala .
he said : &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that weighs on me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to make her point of view clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
among the earlier pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , is going to reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker has been a city building master for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports of varied but also challenging tasks waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , it aston@@ ishes him that so far no application has fulfilled the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
so - considering the regular periods of notice - there should be enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach acts as a sub@@ contractor for the Administr@@ ative Community , the applicant must show corresponding degrees .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it could no longer be completed , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports of a good working climate and good atmosphere between authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , a number of significant projects have accumulated to which W@@ acker can look back proudly .
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is sure about the construction office and its employees .
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park are about to be initiated .
the Kin@@ zig bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even stadium restoration is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will cost around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimates W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a city building master of great le@@ e@@ way .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own yard and gardening a lot can be re@@ acted flexibly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits in , &quot; when new@@ buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring town builder points out .
in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ yer bears high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything is going on my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on long @-@ term employees in support and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing this for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been doing it for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains a long time , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city .
if you would like to be buried by Roland W@@ acker , after providing information from the town of Has@@ lach , you should have a degree in degree as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor with a degree in architecture .
the municipal building office is subject to civil engineering , civil engineering , building instruction , municipal property management , municipal courtyard and city gar@@ dener , as well as Lower building rights authority , including historic monument protection .
bicycle thrown to lines : South railway track closed
according to the police , the previously unknown cul@@ pr@@ its had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track transfer in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines .
these were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and look for them since the night .
near the crime scene , a pink Roll@@ er- and a bike @-@ rider was witnessed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a stroke of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator could have brought himself into great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant as well as the delay @-@ minute drive and the costs of the rail replacement traffic , the pat@@ rons of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speaker said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sub@@ stanti@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern route could be carried out without disabilities .
just under ten passenger trains were open Friday morning , two of them entered the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall out , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal system .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , said that immune cells in the intest@@ ines pat@@ rol in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food cannot penetrate the body .
cells capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .
if the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation , an inflammatory bow@@ el disease can result from this .
in experiments , it was found that a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell in mice occurs which carries a certain bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han enhances toler@@ able , less inflammatory bow@@ el li@@ eus if the same system also works in people .
the post@@ do@@ k@@ tor@@ an@@ din Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , however , who was separately accommod@@ ated , did not .
she suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced in DNA and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells , but lacking them in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was absent and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were given the help of the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabolism which is known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice &apos;s feed , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but if tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan said that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound sign of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cks off against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , matic was excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which gave M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho used his Start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho made three other new commitments , but insi@@ sted that the club had already made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of its four priority obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have taken great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
new plan for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic prime ministers always looked after Berlin with a certain concern .
only no fire from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the League - was the most important desire of the Elec@@ tors .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are monitoring the events in the provincial capitals of the SPD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were failures .
and one by one .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once again shows that red @-@ green can &apos;t go@@ vern reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Parliament elections , his red @-@ green coalition thus lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green federal managing director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the sen@@ sel@@ ess Dutch Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately reti@@ re from her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive Board and campaign manager of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election fighter si@@ ghs when the new ob@@ scene message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , President of the SPD ( SPD ) of Lower Saxony , is after the resignation of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without their own government majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the preliminary cul@@ mination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and no one knows what &apos;s next .
the short@@ com@@ ings began with the un@@ expectedly strong defeat at Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a blue eye , no more , the comrades ed at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this became even worse - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel made the SPD tum@@ ble , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te cleared the party smoothly .
comrades in the weeks afterwards lab@@ oured lab@@ ori@@ ously again .
then , when they had just hat@@ ched new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next drau@@ ght .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD head of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus this weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication it made pretty much wrong about what you can do wrong .
since that time , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
as a result of the VW Be@@ ar Aff@@ air Aff@@ air and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister for Lower Saxony has already been critic@@ ised for some time now .
tremendous demand values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , in recent weeks , Wei@@ l has always tried to set accents in the league .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz &apos;s surroundings .
they let him go , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
at the same time , Wei@@ l is not at fault with the non @-@ parti@@ san purpose of the Dutch Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz did not at all .
for the time being , comrades , therefore , try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger appe@@ aled to the Gre@@ ens , and here especially to the ren@@ eg@@ ed parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ ist T@@ west .
&quot; it is intol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ west puts her own career star@@ ters on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. T@@ westen is not elected as a direct candidate , but via the country list of the Dutch Gre@@ ens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Dutch parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she gives back her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a candidate in the election of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for Centr@@ es III
those who want to be able to renov@@ ate his house in the years can get assistance from the country in the near future .
on Wednesday , Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of the city development were informed on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what has happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been a lot of san@@ itation areas .
at the time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two @-@ thirds of the funding .
in the development area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , recent renov@@ ations are a &quot; achievement project &quot; - it is also important to promote interior design and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on 4 April , the government presi@@ dium of Karlsruhe obtained the information that there will be a renovation area III .
the funding amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 euros came from the country , the rest of the municipality sen@@ timent .
how is a remedi@@ ation area now emerging ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Sch@@ ind@@ ler will continue to investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also plays a role whether there is any interest in the planned area .
if necessary , the territorial borders may shift again .
on Wednesday evening , the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is per plot .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the grant period for the funding is still running until April 1 , 2017 , until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the stock@@ taking would only be carried out in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , according to the rules of the constitution , it shall be possible to begin with the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently stated that every municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preventive examinations .
it is a matter of assessing the conditions of urban@@ ism and deciding when to be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
for the respective property there will also be a remedi@@ ation note in the ground@@ book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sens@@ ations and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; individual stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of stakeholders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore there will be questionna@@ ires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and plot sheet , &quot; where it works , among other things , the structural condition and the renovation prospects .
in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and residential arc , &quot; information about size , layout and residents of a residential space can be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it must be noted that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible for funding .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still emphas@@ ised that the distribution of the subsidies after the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - whoever comes first , grin@@ ds first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , photos of the project &quot; Center nucle@@ us II &quot; were shown to make &quot; tasty &quot; the present .
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aesthe@@ tist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to the medical standard .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now incorporated both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production in the last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the information provided by the military who were left to TI@@ ME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American building programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the Connec@@ ti@@ cut helicopter was placed next to a Ma@@ ine Yacht , a Wis@@ con@@ sin Fire@@ fighter , and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi forkli@@ ft .
the White House Military Office requested the presence of helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , after records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his boss , the Deputy naval commander for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn for the event at 3@@ pm on July 17 , and remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the hours a second team would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you were locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for politically beneficial purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to request their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tru@@ mp carried out an investigation in February when the presidential jet operated in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compla@@ ining about the use of the Pres@@ idential aircraft by his predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products of all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often carry training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to dep@@ ose US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted during the training requirements of the flight crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a be@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; helicopter units flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget awards for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 budget year , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter lies far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement sets is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates involve personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement sets do not include personnel costs , but account for the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract signing .
at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present this week of things manufactured in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people are dependent on it .
and I think most Americans are proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and sh@@ ear@@ ed with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of a tri@@ cky job
leaders of the second tennis league compete in the third Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss takes place tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V .
despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the second tennis League team has won the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially in the back positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V , imports from the high North are particularly concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to assignments in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören und Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need a good portion of luck too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue wh@@ ites could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
at the moment the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man is not part of the Bundes@@ liga , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec is at his first use this season .
the previously un@@ sealed Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ les@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was on the ball yesterday with the White Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el .
he should also be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ scho@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again join the team .
if it is not enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Juni@@ ors World Ranking List in January 2016 , someone fills the cad@@ re from the coach station around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp did not really happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for tightening the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress packed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the U.S. offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plan is to punish European companies that will help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors from domestic O@@ MV , jointly with other European companies , have been al@@ armed with the construction of Nord Stream 2 , Russia &apos;s Eastern Central Bank .
the threat is enormous .
however , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , according to the official statement of the oil group .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would even have to bring the sanctions to life by Executive Order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at what the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el will be the center of attention in the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the ech@@ el@@ ons three and four were confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organisation of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful sponsors , they operate like a Fort@@ une 500 company only with more state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art bri@@ ber@@ y and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry C@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
roll backwards : the city provides 46 food aid
the city organis@@ es the day@@ break from the day of the day .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the city day@@ care centers , the clock is turned back .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head in the department of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking will continue to be out of house : a cat@@ erer is responsible for this task and co@@ ols down freshly cooked .
the city operates 46 day@@ care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at noon .
last year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables and the demand grew steadily .
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for 45 week@@ day hours eat at the K@@ ita for lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay until 14 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time employees from 1 September kitchen service : they warm up the cooked foods , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , divide the meal individually , give out the food , rinse off , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a k@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decide on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen staff now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital administration to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s also about eating healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen staff to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the day@@ rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , besides the quality improvement of the kitchen capacity , also the charm that it turned out in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign allocation for the city as the most economical one , it says from the press office .
and that , even though 46 part @-@ time forces are read@@ ju@@ sted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong for about 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ om , acting leader of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are being di@@ gest@@ ed in the provinces . three women are responsible for the role of vice @-@ pres@@ idents and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ t@@ edly and be involved in all aspects of the election process .
the Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban issued threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be handed over to power peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ om said a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of registered 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to con@@ serve the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow in the case of managers of bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which in addition to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits is produced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that workers and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie called on &quot; express concerns that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t gain clarity from the general @-@ site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of cross @-@ cross , our members are deeply concerned .
generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the Grand Room Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged .
hence , under the perspective of workplaces , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the increasing cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
one spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland Y@@ early yesterday , and the company will react directly to it , as we value continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB officials at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , continuously review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our cross @-@ cross country , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of cross cross as a production site fully and entirely . if our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La Liga &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may regret your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not succ@@ um@@ b to the persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after leaving an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record fall ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous record , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a spring near the Catal@@ ans Board insi@@ sts that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned against this prospect three years ago ?
when Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all clubs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to make one of our players sign up , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressing interest in PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price deals for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator has intentionally kno@@ cked down a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the property number 30 , causing damage to over 200 Euros at the disgu@@ ise of the vehicle .
the police , Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for hints .
for an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police are looking for witnesses .
because a car came to meet him in his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the crash barrier .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um came to Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au with his VW at 7.@@ 55 p.m .
in the area of the b@@ ypass of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to turn right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the crash barrier .
in the car , kind damage was made .
the driver of the coming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident damaged , it can be good that the Mer@@ ced@@ es@@ ier didn &apos;t notice the accident at all .
the police now asks for witnesses of the incident and the driver of the pol@@ lu@@ ter vehicle to contact the com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au on tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports the abuse of the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means Author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are a church , &quot; declared after the publication of the German press agency , he acquired an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would greatly benefit the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound regret over their own la@@ yo@@ ffs or their then false assessment of the processes .
on the other hand , the Vatican magazine Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano critic@@ ised that &quot; double standards &quot; will be measured in the reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
regarding the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; would have to be dealt with , which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; was conspic@@ uous , &quot; said the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ lad@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ ec@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis , too , said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we like to go to the church and this is a dev@@ our@@ ing fres@@ her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches have been a completely normal pedago@@ gical tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children how I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of the mis@@ use cases , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the mem@@ or@@ and@@ um &quot; Mein brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger , is entirely wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he uses the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the lawyer , Ulrich Weber , commissioned by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg ?
between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen became victims of attacks from 1945 to the beginning of the 1990s , 67 dom@@ esti@@ cated j@@ ab pads were sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report it is written about Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially with high emotion , the punishment for the students could be even more severe .
nevertheless , contrary to numerous other accused , many cas@@ u@@ alties would appreciate the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even unite positive memories with him in numerous cases . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ man explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved .
Mr. H@@ atz@@ inger , the 440 @-@ page report on the alleged incidents of violence in Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
on the one hand , many students emphasize his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became more tangible if a cathedral @-@ set musi@@ cally did not bring any top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael hes@@ emann : if one makes the effort and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask himself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is present at all .
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the horri@@ fic cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school also took place outside of his sphere of influence .
it is possible to acc@@ use him at most , to know about it too late or to have taken first references seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus also the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger depic@@ ts a very excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who fed the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy and &quot; always surrounded by grapes grown by children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ bru@@ chen as well .
the fact that he did not only hit the floor with chairs and cast the key ring on the floor , but also j@@ umped into ear @-@ arrows and attracted too nau@@ ghty boys to the hair or ears , he has already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the prob@@ able era , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school .
in comparison with what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , this is certainly dre@@ ad@@ ful .
one already wonders if it has not to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media had just r@@ ushed upon him .
many people who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently at the Bavarian Pope .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every regard !
the media reported a lot about abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen in connection with the report .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also accused of involvement or complic@@ ity in sexual abuse regarding sexual abuse ?
Michael hes@@ emann : no , no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to have entrusted themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of those affected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the En@@ ligh@@ tenment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent .
if they did not even confi@@ de in parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a choir director , who would , to a certain extent , been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen disciples rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael hes@@ emann : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that ... BU@@ T have opened up more urgently or more clearly or rather than to their parents , boarding instructors , teachers of trust , etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the run @-@ up to affected students and / or their environment , it could not be confirmed in the examination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted by all members of the community .
therefore he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to an advertisement .
therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these disgu@@ sting crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting that everything was mixed up and mixed into a huge che@@ ek of sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses and somewhere , right in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
namely , it is clean@@ ly separated : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the secondary school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and exc@@ esses of violence as well as , let us say , other precau@@ tions .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , and for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
all terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were har@@ assed and mal@@ treated and suffered , all of them took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool at Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to prevail .
but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was at that level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; conditions .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims &quot; estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even bring positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported to him by the conditions at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just started establishing himself and of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger systematically lost their ears in front of the states ?
Michael hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 , he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out this to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the pen@@ al punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended penetration .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test pen@@ alties were banned in Bavaria too .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us still knows .
it was difficult to estimate for him , where the suffer@@ ers might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the test penalty for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis did say it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to that time .
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we historians are talking about the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the danger of judging the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the princess was right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was abom@@ in@@ able and also not for what was f@@ aded in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond what was then practi@@ sed .
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally being worked out .
but at the same time I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. ear @-@ arrows and the hair and ears , were widespread in the 197@@ 0@@ ies .
when physical punishment was then banned , he was strictly adher@@ ed to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regensburg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; time has shown Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of the subject of testing also available ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , since the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I do by no means prescri@@ be that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and can@@ dies alone , the un@@ ru@@ ly boys are no big vo@@ cal@@ ist and success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and overcoming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a human being you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deeply beli@@ ever and heart@@ felt person , of which one could not imagine that he could do something for a fly too .
I regularly receive with , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen today , 23 years after his embar@@ go , regularly keep in touch with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who did not forgive him until today , that he was once strict with them , are thus clearly in the minority .
today , most of the dom@@ esti@@ cated cats are thank@@ ful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect person , to which they still look up and worship them down@@ right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and please again clearly : all you repro@@ ach him are educational methods that were on the order of the day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
but it is highly unfair , a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , just too obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the report , which was just released , reli@@ eves him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the starting point would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
