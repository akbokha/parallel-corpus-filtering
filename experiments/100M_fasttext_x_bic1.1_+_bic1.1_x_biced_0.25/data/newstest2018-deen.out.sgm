<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, which is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners are cultivating the rusty ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Munich's oldest official map promotes exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, who had to get upset because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a strapping road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bayern of the State Government, are anything but current - but that is why it is very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavarian atlas is a patchwork that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">The large picture postcard has been incorporated into more detailed maps for towns and municipalities, so-called primordial leaves.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bayerische displacements Authority, between 1810 and 1864, arising from the first measurement of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French Army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops finally withdrew from Lunéville's peace of 9 February 1801, it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a surface-covering Bavarian map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Elector Max IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "" "" "" "" - and thus the Bayerische veying business. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="19">The composition sheet for Munich dates from the year 1856 and, like all others, can be found on the official website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is most impressive on the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877 as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 alongside today's plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser only in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing as fields - at first sight: when zooming in appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbered plots from the so-called "uranium" from which the property tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "small plots are no longer a farmers" "" "" "" "farmers" "" "" "", "but farmers of the plant" "" "" "" "land in sun" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the position paper, in the area of today's district, Au-Haidhausen not only reads the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the hill "On the ventilation" but also in large letters "Irren Badalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked up people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Munich district Irrenberg "Auf der Auer Lünen" was created there in 1858 / 59.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 onwards, Dr. Bernard of Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended up selling the so-called" "" "" "" "Irren" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the staff from using violence against the occupants, "said Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first place had been, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the rotor unit in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Now young people meet in the Salesianum, Munich, on the grounds of the former inner prison.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">The football field of the TSV Munich east is west, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - an architectural reference to the original construction of the Irrenberg, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "" "" "main square" "" "" "" "in 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufinger Gasse. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where this day was the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn race track will take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">The slider lets you compare the old Munich map with the aerial view today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Farmers has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is scheduled to come into force by 28 August 2017, calls on afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, fast-based incidents occur recently throughout the state and will be noted here," it says in the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to claim discrimination, as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you have violations of civil rights that happen to people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard before." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited events such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey and was taken into custody by the Missouri police, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report of the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black motorists in the state will be more than whitewashed in the state 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "" "" "said Chapel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "people must be willing to bring money or relatives to travel through the state." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI secret reporting programme, which classifies the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th place in the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, following the adoption of immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to the ACLU's view of further retirement benefits.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidezaunprojekt is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidefence project is a success project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU member of parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the legal grave yard of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted glimpses into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments holiday palaces.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "Black Forest" "" "" "" "is the alternative for him for the milk of his cows," "" "" "" "says Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">As he is also BLHV-chairman of Fischerbach, he described the Weidezaunproject as "elemental important."</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profitably on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area is for a lot of work, a lot must be worked with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "" "" "" "stressed Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not lead a biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "the Commune has recognized the importance of the Weidezaunay project and is happy about the leaders" support. "</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers would have to be supported at cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be dragged out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to carry on their operation," "" "" "" "emphasized the mayor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "farmers are often criticized for funding because of the promotion." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The surface area is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be afforested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was supported by a leader, a quarter bearing the municipality of Fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers left 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of fence-fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the big advantage is the longevity of fences," "" "" "" "explained Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "also Peter Weiß asserted that" "" "" "" "best food is produced here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Regional Care Centres (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state-of-the-art advancement of wicker fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the presence of a conveyed circulation system designated by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the area to be enclosed must not be towed (inclination above 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">Eight participants with 24 pitches, who want to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, are currently underway for the Fisherbach Weidezaune project in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The area of disclosure is equivalent to 35 hectares; the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The most secure sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have revoked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it intervened, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta was complaining, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "" "" "the poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is technically correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporaneous resonance of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrant, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely, and the wretched waste of your rich strands."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "" "" "there was never a time when" "" "" "" "miserable apostasy" "" "" "" "on our screens was better to see." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that those people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they took a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic picture.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus banded the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argues in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but rather an early neoconservative, bringing the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "she is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "" "" "the torch should not lighten the way to the United States." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual Limbaugh came across here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is all about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not lighten the way, but ignite hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to captain of the team.</seg>

<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also get involved in medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammate voted for me and chose me, it makes me something very special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the preheat of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from a bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers slapped him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked at the critique, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "" "" "for in 1783 Washington said," "" "" "" "The freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and mute, we are waged like sheep for slaughter." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work on being more like Washington.</seg>

<seg id="170">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "" "" "said many people." "" "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>

<seg id="177">He was also very clever to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the Governor's side - which is a public forum designated as official, and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson, Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real folks who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not a trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and unprofessional.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quote the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>

<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one had done the same thing, that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical keys or to arrest and silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>

<seg id="197">That shouldn't be so difficult.</seg>

<seg id="367">According to Phelin Kine, the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Joko's campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realized.</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia's untroubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Africa: visa refusal and a black list," he said in an explanation.</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to Papuas's immediate neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="370">In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.</seg>

<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk has frequently had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery just begins.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk admits: 63.000 have already been withdrawn from the total of 518,000 reservations.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have always pointed out that they are only non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in the United Kingdom 1,000 pounds) "Reservation Plan."</seg>
<seg id="428">At the moment 45,000 of such noncommittal reservations envisage, cleaned musk in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">According to 2018, all models should be 500,000, and one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, there are 1,800 reservations per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you order a Model 3 today, you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines with maximum capacity utilization, never tested in practice.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">However, if there are any major delays, the non-binding of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="438">Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.</seg>
<seg id="439">EPA Head Pruitt is retiring because of delaying the Obama-Era's rules to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era's rules in order to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is about a deadline that expired on October 1 for States to meet the 2015 standards for ozone related to soil.</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt told in June that he would delay the observation by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfering with local decisions or hampering economic growth. "</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a long time a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection regulations.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone over to block or retard regulations for the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the sudden reversal of Wednesday is the most recent legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanlecks.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its reversal in ozone standards simply endorses the willingness of EPA to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in previous administrations, EPA often did not meet the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to be indicted by groups of activists and others," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "" "" "we also take the law and the authority it gives us." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">Nevertheless, the opinion of the EPA said that Pruitt will eventually use his' authority to delay and all other legally available powers' to ensure that the provisions "are based on sound policies and the best available information."</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive readjustment of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a draft law approved last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet voted in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York Public Prosecutor, Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of States who had accused the EPA this week, said the Group intends to maintain the legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the reversal of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smog who flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescuing and maintenance of the oldest building in the village has made the friends and sponsors Tumblets their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilary Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergische judgement paper: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">In addition to the former parish church, the wording of the document, in addition to the former parish church, was also a beautiful courtyard for which the Church or the patronage belonged, and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village image of Tumlingen, the "Berg" is the third, the majestic settlement centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around the year 1600 demonstrate these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval own church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest still remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was connected with the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Larger of the two shattered at Christmas in 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed in later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hammered and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilary Church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the bell tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius plant as successor of Dieter Dockhorn as successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizers invite the friends and sponsors Tumblets on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery in the St. Hilary Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is organised by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann spoke about the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30.</seg>
<seg id="499">At the end of the serenade, a trunk is held in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to forest," "" "" "" "the organizers put out the fantastic views." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organisers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of significance for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and sponsors of Tumblgens feel particularly committed to their home care, such as Walter Martini's Serenade organiser.</seg>
<seg id="504">Association wants to check approval of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"Boisheim abstain" does not see legal requirements for construction and has therefore turned to the Council of the Territories.</seg>
<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim abstain" has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen, only at the border to Schwalmtal there existed a wind-force concentration camp.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration camp, the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the urban area.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "" "" "such zones should prevent" "" "" "" "sparing" "" "" "" "of the landscape." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="511">A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided a second wind-force concentration camp in the Boisheimer Nette a few days before - but that had not been approved by the Düsseldorf district government, because of a malfunction.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted approval is still illegal and therefore also rejected," "" "" "" "said Christoph Erkens, president of" Boisheim "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: before the summer break, the City Council again approved the wind concentration camp in the Boisheimer Nette; approval by the District Government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "Erkens:" "" "" "" "this is where the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally impossible." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="517">The circle takes them to test the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to manifest itself in terms of the argument of the Boisheim association.</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a NEW subsidiary, is planning to build four each 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen participates indirectly, had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare property.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of some 11 400 households will be covered - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-senders.</seg>
<seg id="523">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersens Stadler gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Linnich near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="532">Bad Langensalaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.</seg>
<seg id="533">The Gewerbeverein and the municipal administration intend to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the inhabitants to the shopping spree in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home-shopping" weekend will make the customers aware of what offers their own city has to offer away from the usual supermarket product.</seg>
<seg id="535">According to this, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="536">In addition, local companies are to present their apprenticeships.</seg>
<seg id="537">"" "" "" "in addition, the shops of the city centre invite to" "" "" "" "Midnight shopping" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="539">In preparation, commercials are on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend so Christian König.</seg>
<seg id="540">The municipal administration and the business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</seg>
<seg id="541">In this way, the Gewerbeverein and the city go to another stage of the project "Attractive inner city."</seg>
<seg id="542">This includes new offers such as the first "Active Day" to the well as well as selling Sunday, talks with all commercial traders and hosts in order to move them into active participation.</seg>
<seg id="543">Attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potential is to be re-developed or re-opened.</seg>
<seg id="545">This includes spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But many locals also lost sight of downtown shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end everybody would have to contribute to enliven the city centre - to landlords, the factories of the whole city and clubs.</seg>
<seg id="548">The idea of overcoming the lethargy with a network that was partly broadcasted had said König in spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Mühlhausen announced that the third "home-shopping" day will take part in five Thuringian cities for the first time.</seg>

<seg id="682">They work in several places in their volunteer year.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where to go everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: normally in velvet at the furniture exchange, once a week I am working here in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I worked at school already in the open all-day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What's your experience with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it is a nice, broad spectrum that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, so a Late Volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does that come about?</seg>
<seg id="691">Amount: I did a high school graduation.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineering study, let's say, successfully broken off.</seg>
<seg id="693">For me, I realized that for me it is falsehood and I want to do something else, work with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what are you doing.</seg>
<seg id="695">Do a social year, there's an insight, there you can see how it is on the spot, at the point of burning perhaps, really.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it like that?</seg>
<seg id="697">Amount: I have collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester.</seg>
<seg id="699">I will study dual, probably in Jugendamt Herne, a social worker training and studying at Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.</seg>
<seg id="700">Is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Volunteer Service?</seg>
<seg id="701">Quantity: yes, it is very variable.</seg>
<seg id="702">It always depends on where you make your FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">It can be done from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">It was very varied with me.</seg>
<seg id="705">I was partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was just the right thing that irritated me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs out.</seg>
<seg id="708">In a different way than in civil engineering studies?</seg>
<seg id="709">Quantity: well, here it is not about calculating statics.</seg>
<seg id="710">One always has other people in front of the head, each having a different story behind them.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee or a young person who has been taken out of the family - you must always pay attention to it individually.</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And you had no reservations?</seg>

<seg id="730">The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the Bagram airfield.</seg>
<seg id="731">Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabah is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.</seg>

<seg id="739">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration, under which States are obliged to contain smog-causing emissions. this was done one day after 15 states sued the agency because of the crotch.</seg>

<seg id="743">A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.</seg>
<seg id="744">The government of President Donald Trump has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Trump.</seg>

<seg id="748">In the end, the decision was clear: in two opposing parties, the municipal council of Fluence-Wintzels decided to set up a joint room in the future seniors residence.</seg>
<seg id="749">Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land is signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden.</seg>
<seg id="750">It will still take a while before the parish church has so far been owned by the church community, but there is no planning for the project to be done by a private investor.</seg>
<seg id="751">There is a discussion about a common room.</seg>
<seg id="752">One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total surface of 70 square meters for a special price.</seg>
<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the municipal council are hovering to see such a common room not as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the community-just housing, but openly into the community.</seg>
<seg id="755">"" "" "" "for example, the word" "" "" "" "Strickcafé" "" "" "" "made the round." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="756">The decision, which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget in autumn, will be offset by funding opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="757">The building is in the renovation area.</seg>
<seg id="758">According to Tjaden, the establishment of a joint room would be conducive to 60 percent of 30 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="759">The proposal looks to signal the investor that he does not want to throw a billard between his legs in this regard, stating that both semitrailers - what is leaning against the environmental construction - as well as the pitch roof - which reduces the pitch and makes the construction more economical.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless to say, this is not only Wilfried sole proprietor.</seg>
<seg id="761">When it helps: unanimously, he passes the body.</seg>
<seg id="762">It's not as easy as the common room.</seg>
<seg id="763">Daniela Call refers to the many of his own buildings that are not so easy to move forward, but now they lean back to the common room out of the window, "she says:" I'm very hard with it. "</seg>
<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger does not necessarily speak for the common room - but absolutely against communal participation.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind it a covert subsidies for wealthy or even foreign investors anyway.</seg>
<seg id="766">This is not the case, because with the purchase of the surface there is not a surplus, but gets a real countervalue in the case of doubt, that is the counter-speech.</seg>

<seg id="883">New results of the Swedish asylum-age evaluation tests published</seg>
<seg id="884">The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which were subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish Forensic Medical Authority (Medicinal Medicines Agency) has begun testing the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">They should take a closer look at the estimation of age during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Service (Migration Service) was criticized for failing to judge the correct age of some refugees who were minor.</seg>
<seg id="887">Until today, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or earlier, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person "might be 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"" "" "" "in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person" "" "" "" "possibly under 18 years old" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="890">Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we see no major difference in the statistic of the past few months, the figures are fairly constant," "" "" "" "he said to the journal The Local." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high percentage of cases where the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there are 442 cases that suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older. "</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results published in 581, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of humans to see if they went earlier or later than usually by puberty.</seg>
<seg id="898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="900">"" "" "" "if we cannot confidently say, we should not do as if we could," "" "" "" "he said the newspaper Metro." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="901">However, Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "generally, you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is low.</seg>

<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday, a heavy concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very good in time, it works great," "" "" "" "says Reinhold Leicht, Construction Manager at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the government's presidency of Freiburg." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, work began at the same time on all three rehabilitation bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The construction end is scheduled for October and Leicht is confident that the schedule will be kept.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge coming from Schramberg leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge, covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly redesigned.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead through Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning got a 1.30m wide and seven ton weight so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a marginal attachment, which is also used as operating mode.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday, a 2,20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway should proceed.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing is that it is about finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">A special feeling of tact has required laying cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fibre-optic cable, where many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project prior to the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crayfish had to be fished.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard building and the omnibus in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated in a single lane by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach village entrance, the road is completely closed in the area of the bridge at the altitude of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden."</seg>
<seg id="929">The cost of the three bridge structures is 700 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="930">The whole thing is financed by the country.</seg>

<seg id="1042">He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="1043">During his later wife's sympathies of the people, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand in his almost 50-year reign.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the Football Regulations Affect Neymars Moving to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unobstructed expenses of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the executive organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules that were launched in 2011 by UEFA mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can secure the money by signing Neymar and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, in the face of the financing of the team by the powerful royal family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but they have to counterbalance with legitimate income sources that enable them to break even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had incurred huge debt in their pursuit of success, effectively deceive and risked trying to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen out of favour from the Presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to scare off excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly, FFP is not dead and we will further strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Buy-out clause from Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the revenue streams for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by businesses connected with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Qatari company might sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decreed that the sponsor of the PSA sponsored by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come on payments by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and that such a maneuver could be easily found out for the UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive, to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG via Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people who were familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent Neymars removal by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's final ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American Sport-Tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga with a state that finances a club.</seg>
<seg id="1155">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years," "" "" "" "said Wenger on Thursday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1156">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "once a country has an association, everything is possible." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new source supplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">Over the past few years, Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for the Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the close cooperation is at a possible end: the airline signs the contract.</seg>
<seg id="1161">On request from the news agency SDA, Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott made a corresponding report of the newspaper "Northern Switzerland" from Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"we are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Around 17 million small red-white chocolate-boards weighing 14 grams each year distribute the cabin crew before landing to the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insider estimates the order volume according to "Northwestern Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of about one billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But even more important is the advertising effect: for a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.</seg>
<seg id="1169">The Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants have submitted to the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss producers come into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the treaty beyond the spring of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the SDA, the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Swiss chocolate bars have been handing out Swiss air since 2006 on board their flights.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Prior to signing a contract with Migros, Barry Callebaut had supplied chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.</seg>
<seg id="1175">The possibility to place the logo, Swiss launched two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1176">The airline works together with different Swiss chocolates.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The First Class customers will be pampered at long haul flights from the confectionery Sprüngli, in Business Class dry passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is also nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 "s, for the 90-year Grunge era (when the thinker David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy" The State "for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001 before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise it feels like the time is tight.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humour (it contained an original story for a talking jar of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By sticking to the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play cool kids who grow up - they still managed to win back the last part of the Witzes.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his grown-ups who are now adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more after the rationale rationale, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90-s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character sticks through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from the year 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there's another crazy vicious plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good good impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's lippstache of "singles," whose former big man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">These are the moments of random insanity that could heat this franchise like a repetitive "Seven up!" series until he reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another type of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its Eastern-West wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy with Rhys Thomas, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, is to be a bonded TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues by Channing Tatum (also an executable producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synced in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to watch (the police spends the time watching TV on TV, how Americans might do it with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Open, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Finde out the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who carries a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes it pulls away, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," who was edited on a lower length, could deliver his Agitprop-Satire better, as Gregor and Iosef continue to visit the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything possible for the forage.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious Rumanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Strike against Drugs Mafia in the country</seg>

<seg id="1215">In the case of the same raids in Italy, two people were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects.</seg>

<seg id="1265">The political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members increased in this month because weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and to 1.6% in 2018, and warned that the pressure on budgetary income would continue to rise to just under 3% in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1267">But it signalled that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to curb the inflation heated by the Brexit and it said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected at the financial markets.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment in September following a fight before the High Court against the funding of the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">NHS England announced that pre-prepositional prophylaxis (prep), taken before sexual intercourse, can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent, is now supplied by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1293">He agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court upheld a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.</seg>
<seg id="1294">The chess move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chief Simon Stevens as "important new intervention," while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described this as a "decisive moment."</seg>
<seg id="1295">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable the registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preprepositional prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission of infection endangered.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In clinics, suitable candidates will be identified who agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be known by antiretroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and are registered with a family physician may also opt-in for a possible participation at their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will be awarded £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive sourcing.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence on a large scale, taken and implemented in a targeted manner.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "" "" "Stevens said:" "" "" "" "this large new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former bankers with a passion for real estate, shrank from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne said.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "" "" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but creating the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Moutain lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it appear longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the reflection is like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a bit of engineering art went inside," "" "" "" "explains Erfan of the reinforced, veneered MDF board." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is very important, so when you push the door very easily." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever usage of space and storage, Joanne could gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a real estate agent will enter a rudimentary form and perform a calculation based on the ground size." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface and at the same time use high-quality materials that give space its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and which help create an emotional tie in a home," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "" "" "these are important, but they don't play with your heart." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square footage of something standard into something quite amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a dispute over one of Victorias's largest real estate markets worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business can be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, brothers have collected 38 real estate in the value of more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the family founded Westco jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De LUTIS now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her late father Colin - as described by Paul as "main operator and the dominating personality" in the De LUTIS family - accounts for about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court case states that this means that Colin has property worth $316 million and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Turkey's new Chief Executive Officer plans to restrict the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform track.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring their media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were too convincing," said the former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "" "" "Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "" "" "the key to stick to Twitter's Twitter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Turkey's Twitter custom was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know - that Trump Tweets without their intervention would have contained more fuel.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his associates managed to keep him away for a few times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from provoking controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are trying again and again to present their own agenda by presenting Trump materials that could potentially promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - engaged in this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to provide dubious information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump like a volcano can react to negative press clippings, especially those with shameful leaks, and to find out where they come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February when someone maliciously accused the President of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of Staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to chicans or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began questioning associates about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork and document the Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These invariable factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1482">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified his investigations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1483">CNN reported that there are already invitations to the committee in connection with a meeting between Turkey's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to have purposefully intervened in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Turkey's election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation focused on several men who acted as advisors to the republicans during the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports Mueller took a close look at more and more mps in a private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">A few weeks ago, the Washington Post wrote that the Special Investigator Trump had personally moved to the centre and examined the accusation whether the President could possibly obstruct the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurists is to examine present evidence in possible cases of crime and decide whether it should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Therefore, Grand Jurists are also referred to as prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to present persons to interrogate under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Those who participated in the meeting had been asked to testify, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. Trump Consultants and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election campaign manager Paul Manafort were also in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the exposure show that Mueller would not intimidate himself in his work and that if necessary he wanted to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the charging of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the suspension of the body is the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Amid the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the president used a speech in West Virginia to portray Russia's affairs as a campaign for its political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "" "" "said Trump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "" "" "the subject gives the democrats an opportunity to" feel good, "" "" "" "" because they have nothing else to talk about. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special consultant, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But he also usually works in secret, he emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "" "" "the White House endorses any measures that expedite the work of the special agent in" "" "" "" "fair" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the former FBI chief James Comey said three times that he would not be determined against the President." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1508">There is no reason to assume that something has changed in this way, that it was explained in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller had only been deployed after Trump had fired Comey.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "because of this rationale, accusations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to hamper justice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him for a setting up of investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the president stands under great pressure because of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to US media, the White House collected material against the special promoter and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation as to whether Trump Mueller was going to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special promoter of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later retired president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "several Senators of both parties want to prevent such a step." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented bill reproaches on Thursday, after which the special promoter could no longer be dismissed as easily.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has detached from the Selhagus by the nearly seven-fold size of Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was shared by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar and Maritime Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The colossus, which weighs over a trillion and weighs 5800 square kilometres, will now travel to the north and will probably need two, three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for a human being.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in the fracture of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, for some 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapses in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSICs) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C horseshoe.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelevents swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C horseshoe is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe was disturbed by the balance of waxes and abrupt a couple of years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes about a complete disaster.</seg>
<seg id="1533">It seems that the Larsen-C horseshoe is in danger as well, because the front edge has never been as far back as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate hangs under tension and can break down if a piece breaks down at a pivotal point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of the ice shelf and the iceberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI data, the Larsen-C horseshoe is the fourth-largest glacier of Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the polar plate is now in a more dangerous position," "" "" "" "said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the most widespread retreat since the beginning of records," "" "" "" "he confirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Scientists have argued whether the Larsen-C horseshoe may grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly coincide, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last for decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula have been dismembered over the past few decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has also contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees in the last 50 years, thus counting on the areas where the temperature is growing.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif to staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">As it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant jobs, the CDU calls on the employer to step out of the employer's association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Just before the summer break, the chalk day has stalled 41 new places in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now another 17 trainees have finished their first day of work.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships in the district are obviously much sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were registered for the places to be presented this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the group lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present there are still 50 vacant positions in the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "" "" "according to the parties" "" "" "" "the administration should develop" "" "" "" "a concept for recruitment and personnel development." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is to meet not only short-term demand for skilled workers, but to counteract the candidate gap in a future-oriented way.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-climbers and involve an education campaign, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "" "" "the speech is of a real" "" "" "" "competition of public employers" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This is caused by a high number of employees who excrete disease or age-related issues from the service.</seg>
<seg id="1569">High time for action, so that not even more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the faction of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He took care of a bad surprise already in the day of his work, when he publicly challenged the personnel costs and baffled the rest of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want to check all the possibilities that permit exit from the local employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come short-term to a satisfactory solution, the district administration with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should strive for a house tariff," states.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this way, the CDU tries to pay better the employees and officials than it actually envisages the provision for public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, elevations or more money exist only when switching to a higher level which orientates itself in professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up where employees concerned with the provisions of the new prostitution law.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers, Councillor Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone to NGO migrants' lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, if they are not allowed to continue with new rules for their operations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," "" "" "" "said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organization 'Youth Rettet' because their crew had effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to express itself on the extensive preliminary charges of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for us, the salvation of human life remains our top priority." "" "" "" "we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "" "" "said the organization in an opinion on the social media." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we can judge all accusations currently raised, after collecting all the information and assessing the situation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew takes dinghy migrants aboard, which are delivered directly from traffickers and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's Act, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of overriding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board who oversees their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring" "" "" "" "essential changes or disabilities" "" "" "" "of their rescue actions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign up, the Nobel laureate organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">In the meantime, Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations was greatly reduced in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "" "" "said the Minister." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine wise bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the Northern Palatinate for four days to enjoy trials and sightseeings.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest from Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer ascents, for which long trials were rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the folk festival sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again, there was a view point at the lookout point, connected by "flown" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days, many metres of altitude have been announced.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled curative brine in the outdoor inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - both sporty and culturally.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga matches for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">In the future, the sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles, rather than sweating through the stadium in the wind and the weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sports has long been a serious industry, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gades included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognized the first federal associations which are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 followed the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified for example.</seg>
<seg id="1621">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal primarily with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people will go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the associations tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent E-athletes under contract, you could be present online by far more often than once a year to send the federal bond to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">At the E-Sport, computer games such as League Of Legends, "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the FIFA 3D simulation will be challenged at a competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, Ligen has long since established, in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the 2022 World of Asia, e-sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a kind of sport anyway?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is certainly getting used to getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobous has also long been confronted with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sports - for example, increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid response.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the fit player is a good player." "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1637">But she also sees problems: "doping is becoming more and more an issue."</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls could be elusive in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">In a positive way, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of E-Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are on the road internationally, which is like a large global family, there are no intercultural differences.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to be at 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga, this is little.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the e-sport "is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries are already on the verge of international success.</seg>
<seg id="1647">Big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez are involved in the US team NRG eSports.</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the sports betting supplier Unikrn.</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case appears to be a legal precedent since there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to urge others to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case drew national attention after Carters revealed word releases that she encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, hop on a building, wake up yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.</seg>
<seg id="1684">In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "you must do it, Conrad" and "Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz told that Carter was looking for attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit by any press of the case.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox who was convicted in 2007 for murder at her British roommate in Italy before being acquitted two years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day prior to the announcement by Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW Chairman said the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving constraints," and thus referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support the compliance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for neutralising exhaust fumes from diesel vehicles also increases, making it difficult to maintain the price of the cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of abusing powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called sealing units that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but in normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">Several employees of Volkswagen have been indicted in the United States, others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was incorporated into German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to circumvent the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States has been extended.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is in decline due to the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and insect-borne insects, which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert from the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cicay, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodocice usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the latest mayhem in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials, and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists will discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and abdominal feelings are sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no respite from violence, and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country, more and more journalists are in it: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is Riodocius, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "" "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, even though his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez that shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hanging on the facade of the Riodocice building. two reporters in the 1930's, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters will discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Federal Attorney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of killings linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely tried in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodocione they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are intrinsically and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit," "" "" "" "says Ibarra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "as long as we don't know the Why, we blust all." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodociin the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter stopped in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people will be shot on the streets every day or that the graveyard is full of decorated two-story mausoleums for drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodocice, was crushed by guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First there was in February the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust auctions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have upset the sons of suspected aisle runners bought each copy of the issue when it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave the country for its own security following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing was seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he was always there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues for the creation of Riodocice and sold 50 US $shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "" "" "in Sinaloa," "" "" "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem," "" "" "" "said Bojorquez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters would like to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever she led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was scared.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "" "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "" "" "is a way of life," "" "" "" "he said last October in an interview with Romsviento-TV." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you have to take over the task that you think as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "" "" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodolce Team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who could curse as a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and rattles, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "" "" "now they ask," "" "" "" "Is his love for routine his ruin?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways," "" "" "" "to move drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "" "" "said Bojorquez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells bad, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the publisher of Riodocius Andres Villarreal said, "Smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then things happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, do not apply to Sinaloa anymore - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">Days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodocice in a four-storey building in a middle class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the policemen called the governor himself as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodocice has printed on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known driver Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to government spending, which concentrated on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor to carry out a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political planes almost all the century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped from a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months earlier, the readers would have viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past, we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body composition.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now all channels of communication are broken with our sources." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez popped a few notes and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist to the Office of the Public Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country journalists have become louder by having written down on pavements and buildings in organized protests.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez reproached the authorities to spy on journalists and put them around because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "since then she has asked her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "" "" "" "surrounded" by organised crime, government officials involved. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the media group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "" "" "" "said Ramirez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Apparently, the killings have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>

<seg id="1926">The report in "Current Biology" described him as "the best-preserved dinosaur ever found, and one of the world's best dinosaurs."</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Radio as he was on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of place by the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years exposing the wild animal within the 2500 lbs (1,100 kg) of severe peanuts.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only smile a little with your eyes, you can almost believe that it has slept," said the principal author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur examples - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaur." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-coating, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed him to get better into his surroundings and to soften his enemies, say experts, indicating that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now exhibited at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli, named after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours in revealing it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a common method of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs were driven by sufficient pressure by eating meat eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signals that this Nodosaur was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been of chalk time," "" "" "" "said Brown." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on its life, including its preserved intestine, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea floor.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as Souflorida today, and rivers and oceans probably far more inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaur is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," Brown added.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early chalk period." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only look a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is asleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of weighted monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk after death in the sea and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Radio, when he was buried on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the world's best-preserved dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from muzzle to hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that were raging from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivorous was swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater hull of the dinosaur has preserved its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the skin rests still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as' rare as a gain in the lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Fossilized remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>

<seg id="1973">There are numerous wounded, milder-long Stans - and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-München (A8) about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass arambollage.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the police, around 17.00 hrs between the junction places Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, nearly 30 vehicles, among them probably also trucks, were cramped together.</seg>
<seg id="1976">At first there are no indications of the exact number of injuries.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It was a matter of light to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large supply of ambulance vehicles was at the scene of the accident.</seg>

<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which is what most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have access to the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking your ticket anyway.</seg>

<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, keep on working, keep silent.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Those who travel often know that in addition to delays and missed train tickets, ticket inspections are among the biggest annoyances.</seg>

<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to prove.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or greater space and delays in controlling one's ticket and taking the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 11pm, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11th.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and power that exists from the point of view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>

<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>

<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration on Sabaah Folayan, Ferrell met one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came from Ferrell: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of white people in a community benefiting from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other natives, the team of Whose Streets followed suit.</seg>

<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown ones, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year custodial sentence after she publicly traded diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwife and groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, like someone with these genomic data, a sharp, though somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">In prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning clearly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of its 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from waste in order to produce a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while they were in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg in a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her detained muse became unequal penalties which, over the course of two years, exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "supplemental images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President would transform the judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually demanded a few days after the book was published to claim Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new, tweetable ways in order to continue flaming the rigid divisions that he should actually rectify.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a specific reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In an artistic statement written down on the wall of the Gallery, Manning called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological ways, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully carry with is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore 30 of these stories are." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the Comic-Novelle mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she emerges from the discipline of the United States as King-Kong with a free-speaking tango.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if they make your speech cold, they have won" "" "" "", "it says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "so never let your mouth." "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I still get goosebumps when I talk about it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by their own genomic simulations, which gather like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It was also target-oriented, like everything in the exhibition, to the size (5 "2, Manning Statur), where their genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to compete with your staff at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">The answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not mourn the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there has never been consistency and objectivity," "" "" "" "said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-Up Race is on the rise to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring staff engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, provide staff anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years gained with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of certain teams, it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low tuned results - so that you can drill why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they must stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you will not be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like GLINT this wish is a lucrative business opportunity after an overview.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation, and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020 according to the Let's Talk Payments website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber case in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Convercent companies can send customised "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main managing director is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has grasped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites, has appointed Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that had previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified quicker and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," "" "" "" "said Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and we protect shareholders from employment law disputes" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 more seriously after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry going online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is a business model and a chance to find the agreement of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glittering secured $10 million in November of Bessemer's venture partners and brought his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees are expecting more from their jobs than before." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"when people are happy to be in a company that owns their voices, and that the work you do is worth it, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn who uses both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach yields if their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretakers of a firm do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks staff for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotify employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"when you ask for 4.000 ideas, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies who have too much left to gather data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for if you don't follow, co-workers ask," "" "" "" "Do you really hear me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "" "" "and if you don't care about why I should?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported about GLINT, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after receiving feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to re-organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday the company always gets new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high sales.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency you will lose man," "" "" "" "said Vitrano." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I have overrated my welcome-greeting") that seems to be all too nice to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke to landscape makers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>

<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust got full access only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said," Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, cards representing what possessed: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.</seg>

<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer' that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an uprising that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled" Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex, "says Rhodes.</seg>

<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler' in which the smuggler, Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin filled with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen appeared to be quite a Gauner, always making debt and spending money on things they could not afford.</seg>

<seg id="2337">Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army</seg>
<seg id="2338">Each year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirement and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance a normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting no longer took place in the headquarters of the General Staff, as previously, but in the office of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">The discussions took place under the chairmanship of the Heads of State, now also the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="2344">These were the number of civilians in the YAS.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government pulls the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Chief of staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commander of the army, the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the coup failed, President Erdogan fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as an executor of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people directly involved in the coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the overthrow of God as a "gift of God," because he had given him the opportunity to "completely clean the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the paper Hürriyet published an article entitled "Unites in the Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">On the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the cap ban on female soldiers, wrote the paper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the major impact of the army and security forces continues.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July Erdogan sent another 7395 servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were earlier than the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they listened to their role as guardians of the secular state.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pressed the power of the military step by step, not least relying on the reform requirements of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan drives targeted an Islamisation of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe," a particularly unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt to asylum in foreign countries warned that the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.</seg>
<seg id="2362">If this happens, such a development could not leave Nato cold.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should concern ourselves</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it won't be even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots will come.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies supply a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey at the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are reached by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can "adapt" his robot according to his convictions and select everything from the eye colour of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes more worrying as many robots have "personalities" that would make a stepford woman look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot, developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of timidity and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality," "" "" "" "enthuses the True Companion website." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">During the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "" "" "it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or it can be" "" "" "" "in mood" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step towards Frigid (is called here: reluctant) Farrah, unsettling one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website compared true companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then not have Roxxxy?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing sophistication point to something dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjection as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course have no sex robots, and while the FRR acknowledges their growing popularity, they remain tentatively on the brink of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the edge areas can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots will emerge in a time where the rights of women worldwide are threatened in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have sexually assaulted women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the worn-out bodies and the excluded eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as possible (though with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, brought to the point when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the saying of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Homps great power?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human understanding</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all pretending to leave our filter bags burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noted is the power of bringing families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning dighter who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including the republican kinship with which she had fought for decades for politics, suddenly and quite strangely on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it is in a further context that this also involves considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will not repel us any more.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump is "normalizing republicans of the right wing," which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself falling from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of the deceased - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both compared to Trump are indeed a very mild offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump comes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in town, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Parks Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are creaking and the animals twist to look at their own shoulders - extremely gloomy and the music-pering music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not live up to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the Theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park-carousel is still a strange magic experience, since two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-olds go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but thankfully nobody asked him.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this is to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to slowing down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologizing, while I was tired of the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain</seg>

<seg id="2452">Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed he had his girlfriend for a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>

<seg id="2525">Ll Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.</seg>
<seg id="2526">As announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) belong to the honored guests this year.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Traditionally US President Donald Trump will host a reception and join the award with his wife Melania.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The prize winner, which was announced with progressive TV series, already announced that he would refrain from participating in the gala.</seg>
<seg id="2530">He said: "this presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depriving them of the means - and that weighs on me."</seg>

<seg id="2534">We make the city worth living</seg>
<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslach's Stadtbaumeister, is going to retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker has been a city building master for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun, as he mediates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports of varied but also challenging tasks waiting for his successors.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it astonishes him that so far no application has fulfilled the requirement profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - considering the regular periods of notice - there should be enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach acts as a subcontractor for the Administrative Community, the applicant must show corresponding degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If it could no longer be completed, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports of a good working climate and good atmosphere between authorities and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">In more than 30 years in office, a number of significant projects have accumulated to which Wacker can look back proudly.</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city worth living," he is sure about the construction office and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future varied projects are on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla-Areas and the Niederhofen park are about to be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even stadium restoration is still a topic.</seg>
<seg id="2551">"" "" "" "the latter will cost around 1.5 million euros," "" "" "" "if we do it right," "" "" "" "estimates Wacker." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2552">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "all in all, great tasks await my successor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">Design is available for a city building master of great leeway.</seg>
<seg id="2555">With Haslach's own yard and gardening a lot can be reacted flexibly to many.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you can move a lot," "" "" "" "said Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2557">As the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in," when newbuildings are approved, the retiring town builder points out.</seg>
<seg id="2558">In any case, the Stadtbauyer bears high responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">"" "" "" "he is a builder," "" "" "" "in the end everything is going on my table." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2560">He can count on long-term employees in support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been doing this for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been doing it for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">"" "" "" "also that his successor remains a long time, Wacker wishes:" "" "" "" "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">If you would like to be buried by Roland Wacker, after providing information from the town of Haslach, you should have a degree in degree as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor with a degree in architecture.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The municipal building office is subject to civil engineering, civil engineering, building instruction, municipal property management, municipal courtyard and city gardener, as well as Lower building rights authority, including historic monument protection.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Bicycle thrown to lines: South railway track closed</seg>
<seg id="2566">According to the police, the previously unknown culprits had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track transfer in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) to the lines.</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and look for them since the night.</seg>

<seg id="2571">The perpetrator could have brought himself into great danger and also jeopardized the train traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2572">In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant as well as the delay-minute drive and the costs of the rail replacement traffic, the patrons of the railway customers could also come to the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2573">"" "" "" "the speaker said," "" "" "" "Substantial" "" "" "", "said the spokesman." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2574">The damages were repaired on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the southern route could be carried out without disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="2575">Just under ten passenger trains were open Friday morning, two of them entered the correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight trains did not fall out, but they had a delay.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch, some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan by proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal system.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, said that immune cells in the intestines patrol in order to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food cannot penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result from this.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell in mice occurs which carries a certain bacterium in its intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan enhances tolerable, less inflammatory bowel lieus if the same system also works in people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, however, who was separately accommodated, did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">She suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced in DNA and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells, but lacking them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that a intestinal microbiome was absent and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given the help of the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan-metabolism which is known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but if tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2605">With Nemanja Matic, Manchester United has signed a "genius" with Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder had his debut at Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="2606">The 40 million pound sign of Chelsea started with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup kicks off against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder's role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will.</seg>
<seg id="2607">However, matic was excluded from the pre-preparatory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes, which gave Mourinho that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season.</seg>

<seg id="2609">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we will help him to be ready sooner than later." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2610">In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho used his Start-XI for the beginning of the season.</seg>

<seg id="2615">The aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="2616">The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in US state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the USA, which are several thousand kilometers.</seg>

<seg id="2625">Since Martin Schulz has led the party, this has changed fundamentally.</seg>

<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of the SPD, lost his Nimbus this weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because in crisis communication it made pretty much wrong about what you can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since that time, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.</seg>

<seg id="2653">As a result of the VW Bear Affair Affair and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister for Lower Saxony has already been criticised for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Tremendous demand values were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, in recent weeks, Weil has always tried to set accents in the league.</seg>
<seg id="2656">The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz's surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They let him go, because they promised a stabilization of the party by Weil.</seg>

<seg id="2672">Those who want to be able to renovate his house in the years can get assistance from the country in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2673">On Wednesday, Albert Schindler and three representatives of the city development were informed on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what has happened so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been a lot of sanitation areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At the time, in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the funding.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the development area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, recent renovations are a "achievement project" - it is also important to promote interior design and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On 4 April, the government presidium of Karlsruhe obtained the information that there will be a renovation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount was 833 333 Euro, of which 500 000 euros came from the country, the rest of the municipality sentiment.</seg>

<seg id="2682">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "so Schindler will continue to investigate where the" "" "" "" "really old" houses are. "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="2684">If necessary, the territorial borders may shift again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">On Wednesday evening, the bridge represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "" "" "Keller presented the contents of the federal program" "" "" "" "Social City" "" "" "", "where the renovations would then be carried out." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving the living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be object-related, that is per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The grant period for the funding is still running until April 1, 2017, until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, the stocktaking would only be carried out in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, according to the rules of the constitution, it shall be possible to begin with the restructurings in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently stated that every municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preventive examinations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is a matter of assessing the conditions of urbanism and deciding when to be rehabilitated and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">For the respective property there will also be a remediation note in the groundbook.</seg>

<seg id="2698">Therefore there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">The yellow questionnaire is the "building and plot sheet," where it works, among other things, the structural condition and the renovation prospects.</seg>
<seg id="2700">In the gray questionnaire, the "household and residential arc," information about size, layout and residents of a residential space can be made.</seg>

<seg id="2703">In addition, new construction measures are not eligible for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2704">Schindler still emphasised that the distribution of the subsidies after the "greyhound principle" works - whoever comes first, grinds first.</seg>

<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are a church," declared after the publication of the German press agency, he acquired an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would greatly benefit the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their profound regret over their own layoffs or their then false assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">On the other hand, the Vatican magazine Osservatore Romano criticised that "double standards" will be measured in the reporting on violence in the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that "shameful and shameful acts" would have to be dealt with, which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" was conspicuous, "said the author Lucetta Scarladia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>

<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer, Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the diocese Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, 547 Regensburger Domspatzen became victims of attacks from 1945 to the beginning of the 1990s, 67 domesticated jab pads were sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is written about Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotion, the punishment for the students could be even more severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, contrary to numerous other accused, many casualties would appreciate the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even unite positive memories with him in numerous cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesman explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hatzinger, the 440-page report on the alleged incidents of violence in Regensburger Domspatzen, "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, which became more tangible if a cathedral-set musically did not bring any top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael hesemann: if one makes the effort and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to ask himself why the name Georg Ratzinger is present at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses at the pre-school also took place outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to accuse him at most, to know about it too late or to have taken first references seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as - literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus also the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger depicts a very excellent testimony, describes him as "warm," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teacher who fed the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by grapes grown by children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which led to Wutausbruchen as well.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only hit the floor with chairs and cast the key ring on the floor, but also jumped into ear-arrows and attracted too naughty boys to the hair or ears, he has already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for this.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the probable era, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In comparison with what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, this is certainly dreadful.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One already wonders if it has not to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media had just rushed upon him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many people who have never understood him are still working diligently at the Bavarian Pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every regard!</seg>
<seg id="2929">The media reported a lot about abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of involvement or complicity in sexual abuse regarding sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael hesemann: no, no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "" "" "said one of those affected," "" "" "" "It was very embarrassing for me." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even confide in parents and siblings, certainly not a choir director, who would, to a certain extent, been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen disciples rate Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael hesemann: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that... BUT have opened up more urgently or more clearly or rather than to their parents, boarding instructors, teachers of trust, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "so the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "" "" "that in the run-up to affected students and / or their environment, it could not be confirmed in the examination." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted by all members of the community.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Therefore he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to an advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these disgusting crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "" "" "in the media there was a lot of" "" "" "" "violent excesses" "" "" "" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "" "" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "" "" "looking away" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael hesemann: that's the big problem in reporting that everything was mixed up and mixed into a huge cheek of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere, right in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, it is cleanly separated: between the preschool and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence as well as, let us say, other precautions.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, and for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which the sadistic teachers were harassed and maltreated and suffered, all of them took place at the preschool at Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous conditions had to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "" "" "the subject" "" "" "" "pre-school" "" "" "" "was at that level." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims" estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even bring positive memories with him despite violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most, the accusation remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported to him by the conditions at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just started establishing himself and of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger systematically lost their ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael hesemann: no, because already in 1989, he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "" "" "in this he points out this to" "" "" "" "that the penal punishment will continue to be practised at the preschool." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended penetration.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test penalties were banned in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult to estimate for him, where the sufferers might be exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis did say it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "" "" "Michael hesemann:" "" "" "" "we historians are talking about the" pitfalls of anachronism, "" "" "" "" so the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2975">"" "" "" "the princess was right." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable and also not for what was faded in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond what was then practised.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it is finally being worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, i.e. ear-arrows and the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970ies.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he was strictly adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "" "" "what picture of his" "" "" "" "Regensburg" "" "" "" "time has shown Georg Ratzinger in the talks with you for the book" My brother of the Pope "" "" "" ""? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of the subject of testing also available?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, since the Domspatzen played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do by no means prescribe that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candies alone, the unruly boys are no big vocalist and success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "what a human being you have experienced Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believer and heartfelt person, of which one could not imagine that he could do something for a fly too.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive with, like many former Domspatzen today, 23 years after his embargo, regularly keep in touch with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until today, that he was once strict with them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Today, most of the domesticated cats are thankful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect person, to which they still look up and worship them downright.</seg>
<seg id="2993">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and please again clearly: all you reproach him are educational methods that were on the order of the day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unfair, a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that is behind it, just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"" "" "" "for the report, which was just released, relieves him." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the starting point would be a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
