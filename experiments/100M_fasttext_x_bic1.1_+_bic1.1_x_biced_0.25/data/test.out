28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a local grocery shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse , found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia of San Francisco and distributed the San Francisco court .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was clas@@ sed as a murder and the investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia announced that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things went up for him finally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
to combine his style with his family was to always cook us something , prepare dinner for us , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to participate in any sort of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ cut diamond shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has any information in this case will be asked to call the telephone call of the SF@@ PD at number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I will always be put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or get stuck from outside labels , which have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more sn@@ ak@@ y to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her being &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current cosm@@ opol@@ itan .
most of the time , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , with TV with loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , it &apos;s called in the magazine .
&quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; said the Hollywood star .
in her new film Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs from August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger and some colleagues were looking for a little change with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted at the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to feed the fo@@ dder .
one kilometer at that pace , I was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses .
he had his family run over the facility of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he was not even photograph@@ ing .
long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ thilfe handed over the gold standard pyramid to the man from An@@ hausen under a small gala .
there is no lack of awards for the symp@@ athetic sports@@ man .
silver bay leaf , Champions Tour Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already gu@@ essed him .
the 18th prize winner of the pyramid of sports has long been a long time .
on Saturday he met the first prize lau@@ re@@ ate Hans Günter Win@@ kler in Aachen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this distinction means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting young people .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away .
with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; on Saturday .
the winners include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ffen , the fen@@ cer Cor@@ nel@@ ia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ um the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ women came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company went to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza @-@ Prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept a distance from the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - this is what Clinton and Tru@@ mp want to do .
however , the two US presidential judges are not one , but in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue .
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosophical difference .
who , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warn against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death , he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he himself would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely re@@ tract regulations and make himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
that is why the taxes for the rich would increase , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it must be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton speak almost all the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so , on Tru@@ mp , party @-@ internal discussions could be forthcoming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the United States .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , he wants to quit the Paris climate agreement .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend and demand renew@@ ables with its investment programme : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ lian trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - they simply want to better protect American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be paid better then , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the present minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp is standing , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics stick to him , so that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand Clinton , who wants to demand at least from the rich to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fled woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is a part of women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday .
when they arrive in Germany they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby that is at most one year old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one has put her small son in her arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she s@@ miles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the division manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a representative for social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centralised accommodations for single @-@ run women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs has set up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - even not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten oppression or death , or because their families send them as hop@@ eful@@ s to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many secretly steal away from seeing no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience of sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ our@@ able mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run , this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , tu@@ gs require a sexual act for a bottle of water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that end as soon as they fall in Germany , B@@ ahr re@@ counts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used at worst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the housing in Munich &apos;s North are traumati@@ zed , appreciate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children were certainly not voluntarily created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what they experienced , because shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they often don &apos;t know how to help , there are more accommodations just for them , B@@ ahr requests .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their sphere of jurisdiction , some answer with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in self @-@ shel@@ ters of the governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia only fled women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are in some community shel@@ ters or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committee also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy is missing or men and women are accommod@@ ated , it can lead to - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the women feel this need of protection , it is possible to read about the urge that there is at the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been talking about the fact that we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily open a second home .
assistance specialists strike out : demands for new work @-@ fighting measures
representatives of the assistance specialists have called on their union to approve new employment campaigns in their dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded its entire council to approve more work @-@ fighting measures starting at the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ DC &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; testified that ministers had agreed to address the concerns of the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assistance specialists and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; to problems , which led to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and solic@@ it official re@@ negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Committee today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A council in order to approve a running program of escal@@ ating working @-@ fighting measures beginning at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that assistance specialists went on strike six times this year , the first overall cases in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assistance specialists Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance specialists and medical students , with that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced in force .
Russia and Turkey : an alliance of out@@ si@@ ders ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight @-@ month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara is most willing to reconci@@ le this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be sli@@ pper@@ y and he didn &apos;t radi@@ ate any heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if something bad happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s brilliant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction : the surplus of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was burning .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back of Russia .
the transgres@@ sion was even greater , as it was celebrated by a supposed friend .
re@@ building the c@@ ous@@ ins becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out severe un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
the most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are clearly obvious .
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was removed from his office last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agents and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this week , the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti quotes it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West , as it looks at the reaction to the attempted transfer of power as a weak response .
in addition , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment on the s@@ nail speed of EU membership negotiations and Putin - which is eager to deri@@ ve benefits from the cool sen@@ timent and to reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship with the West .
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara on security that after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at , he called for support for the elected state organs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is surely a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the summit in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described : two countries that have been viol@@ ating and badly treated by the West and now f@@ ain@@ ting themselves .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two still .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave its role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents spoke at the press conference that they had not even stri@@ pped the subject .
the president of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress these differences .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in the face of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s head of office , the R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the global ambi@@ tions of the Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing are to be changed to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for the private client business that will gain more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand as well as the brand with which our employees will be employed , as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global targets , but local targets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that his Six Nations sponsor@@ ship will no longer be carried away and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we focus internally ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for clients ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , one will see many changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori gains 3,000 prize on Pre@@ dile@@ ction at New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,000 prize
Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori assured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British winning at New@@ market on Friday .
he placed a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester &apos;s Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who before it won on G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the che@@ er when he takes the victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ times winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who scored more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester &apos;s Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career opportunities
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern times and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone that few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already scored 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden almost 30 years winner , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
flying fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of grand tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties in the beginning when he returned from his six months &apos; lock , but he showed an impressive character of character to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his burial .
and he hasn &apos;t come to the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his age of at least 5 .
Russian Putin damp@@ ens chief of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expectedly released his chief of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was many years part of Putin &apos;s tigh@@ test confidence circle .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed a Special Repres@@ entative for environmental and transport opportunities .
in a statement by the Krem@@ lin it reads that without stating grounds , Putin has ordered the discharge of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been deputy to Ivan@@ ovo since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it is written ( in Russian ) that he later became a log chief and Chief of Staff of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activities as head of state on bills of law and controls on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin announced the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked me to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convinced ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step has made Moscow more mysterious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confi@@ d@@ ants Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will res@@ ign on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official claim - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president , at one time would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin cited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in the beginning of 2012 in a conversation , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compla@@ ining post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he named Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term of office , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia as a third term in office would have viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another close ally to Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became president again three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced his dis@@ miss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before announ@@ cing his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set , there was artistic differences and differences of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
details about how the character of Gib@@ sons from the series , followed by a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the statement by ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Issu@@ es and have put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the planned radi@@ ance of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
one of the inhabitants of Ban@@ ff called for help in the identification of the fish , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that with the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale , there could be a fountain out of a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives ca . 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the show of the two inches long fish .
crossing the Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lid blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hel@@ ical ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
overall , almost 79 % of the whole deck is placed in their place and the last section of the deck is now getting a g@@ ong for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager at the For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone for each bridge project .
in this fantastic project , the closure is future @-@ oriented high @-@ end and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the expanding north tower deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or the west side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
delicate because the toler@@ ances that the team worked on were tiny - they were just a few milli@@ meters on each side .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck the alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm , after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat rolling around and imagined the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rescue station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of their reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging at a Bo@@ je without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the sea rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat motor , though , had a stop@@ over , which , however , lo@@ osed the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has watched these men today .

who is building Braunschweig &apos;s cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens think that in the future , investors should be much stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 convenient apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept of living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but war is inevitable .
first of all , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
so far there is no provision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are united with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to build on urban areas must pay 20 percent of all flats as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favourable apartments , however , can also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on such surfaces to build at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and still be financed , should provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , as viol@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants investors to make as few prescri@@ ptions as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er constraints for investors .
no matter how viol@@ a , there is an escal@@ ation of the situation in the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program does not yet fully stand : for the roughly 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you reconci@@ le the loss of further around 1300 affordable apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , according to the political spokesperson Nicole Palm , now @-@ running bind@@ ings should be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be re@@ thought to bring apartments back into the price fixing .
this is possible in the West city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in West@@ stadt , deadlines are expected to rise at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back into the price fixing for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations .
because the number of social housing in the West city is drastically increased , the aim of the so @-@ called mixing is removed .
there should be no concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in only a few districts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will be still movement in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , I have concentrated on more space for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can still be found ?
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it &apos;s fascinating to watch how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go out to play anymore , but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens , has been lam@@ ed by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ em@@ on Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and recently limited to smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July something .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ bur@@ dened the servers .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than inks and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ em@@ on , which are followed by a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; can be captured .
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the tram and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person re@@ stores every day .
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , who followed 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of subsequent people exercising 30 minutes each day , increased from 45 percent to 53 percent each day .
the company does not know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees the raw data for the increase in performance .
many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to take &quot; 30 minutes of time , &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; and &quot; active every day &quot; met deaf ears because many public messages about health are boring and coming from people who look miserable .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
those who regularly exercise sports are reducing their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even include new friends on the hunt .
as always there are gru@@ mp@@ tive gam@@ bl@@ ers who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could go against a door .
what is it supposed to be ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit have already been able to track our activity earlier , they have no reason to do sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will decrease with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast cleared the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the American woman Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the balance beam during the individual multi @-@ year campaign of women in gymnas@@ tics at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who gains a multi @-@ battle title , and in total the fifth , while she rein@@ forces her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears as her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated her sport and won 15 med@@ als , including 10 gold med@@ als , including 10 gold med@@ als , which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she was expecting a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
do not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered disappointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after having won Gold and Silver at the Women &apos;s Retail Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clam@@ ation mark on the farewell party of the team coordinator , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i , who retired .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during their long journey , it is not really true .
some of her floor exercises , including their typical Tum@@ bling Pass , are att@@ un@@ ed to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by coach A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym@@ nasi@@ um , in which Bo@@ or@@ man exercised her , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost any competition competition , a series of victories that will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even though Mu@@ staf@@ ina was slightly led by two turns , the picture was mur@@ ky .
Swedish bars and ground tracks - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ ned .
she resum@@ ed again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam - and sat on top with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when she expected her end - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago , when it fought for third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , who is called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her exercise she kno@@ cked down the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the fast broad@@ ening T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in a serial killer when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot dead in one of Phoenix &apos;s dead@@ liest attacks in the first mass mur@@ der@@ ous attack of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th while the car was par@@ ked in an entry , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police informed that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y because the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who owned one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard den@@ ounced the shooting of the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks .
altogether , seven people were killed in nine attacks in His@@ panic living quarters within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; told Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments out of the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , playing toys and of course his mother .
but like least of his Alter@@ vor , Ed@@ mund Micro cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t create it .
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let myself in that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course you got into it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband , Vincent and her , was told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can help with a help .
Ed@@ mund was not able to sit or craw@@ l until his third year of age and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something before &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters on his own .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ci@@ ca@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to is remember@@ ing the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I wondered what was going to happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the ci@@ ca@@ virus .
it gets better .
you know it will get better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding , cause for ba@@ il@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
violent ra@@ ins and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their shores and threatened with large @-@ area floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that only the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over wide areas in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inches could drop in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while Mobile continued to rain in the Mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams were still sending people out of flood in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , greatly increases overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives near him would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flo@@ ated and flo@@ cked in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years where she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one to swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were housed up to Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread rapidly , as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities would consider ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer near Liv@@ ing@@ stone walked from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was considerably out@@ weighed by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ all and floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and lesson in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that there were 200 neighbouring houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , now floo@@ ding them both .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets which were r@@ ins@@ ed from floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ acu@@ ees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed because of the flood and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents to take part , who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ acy Land@@ rum said about the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses were reported to be reported as floo@@ ding on Thursday , but no reports have been reported on Friday .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager of Shop@@ per &apos;s Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places I have never seen before , &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; and it is still coming . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; bul@@ ged by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police tells us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries including in the loin , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in the hospital when he was transported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was bul@@ ged by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ors Mel@@ ende@@ z to the station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe this .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is likely to recover .
he should have started the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
likewise , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who finds himself in a critical condition , shot up , reports the station .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating if one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it was apparently a cross@@ fire between several gun@@ men .
cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , paraly@@ zed the crime scene .
it seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , there were sleeves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that there have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ port@@ edly inspec@@ ting the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a sle@@ eper on her arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she is re@@ covering and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns and this for more than one reason .
first , I joined every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US was never so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this crew , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is a ca@@ tho@@ lic , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the past four years , the number one among female gym@@ na@@ sts was an Af@@ ro @-@ Americans .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise winner of the Olympic Games .
now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the thre@@ ef@@ old world champion in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ly Gy@@ mask routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won Gold in an individual competition for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of this kind of sport , but so sports classes in the whole country do not look like this .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all hit the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to get into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four teams in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily comes into private sports clubs that are maintained by parents responsible for training , education , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for coaches and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) .
the majority of these Turn@@ ver@@ eins are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
the gym@@ na@@ sts receive their entire training in these clubs and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment for the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started doing gymnas@@ tics .
we have to explore the churches out of countless young girls , who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , to make a more affordable and easy accessible gymnas@@ tics training .
I founded my sports foundation for 20 years .
in my events we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters ( mainly black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high @-@ quality gym@@ na@@ sts that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this fantastic Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this true representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gol@@ ds and than@@ king you so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance specialists want to organize further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance specialists who voted in favor rejected him .
in July , Hun@@ t had revealed plans to forci@@ bly introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS would find itself in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; and any further delay to the employees and patients would be harmful .
the first assistance specialists are supposed to receive a new contract , which includes changes to noc@@ tur@@ nal and weekend supplements to improve care at un@@ favourable times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair of the BM@@ A Committee on Assistant Doc@@ tors , announced last night in a message : &quot; assistance specialists have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current mat@@ ernity crisis and it will be given to treat all physicians . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time is running out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes stem@@ med from the government for reluct@@ ance to participate , and sometimes on ear @-@ num@@ bing silence .
this happened to the promise Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made for the last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to raise awareness and address the concerns of the assistance specialists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assistance specialists have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work @-@ fighting measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 consultations , as nur@@ ses and specialist doctors were included in order to provide coverage for doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ end@@ payment for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance specialists who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS Emplo@@ ye@@ es , urged the assistance specialists to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action campaigns reach nothing but burdens loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we spoke to the committee of assistance specialists and responded positively to the health ministry and other mini@@ stries with regard to tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
employers hoped that the continued positive engagement to other important topics - such as sending , flexibility in training , training k@@ sts , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holiday and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously it was the employers , Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A agreements in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per @-@ day drug that can reduce heart risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per @-@ day medication after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
N@@ HS regulatory authority N@@ ICE has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
N@@ HS regulatory authority N@@ ICE has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 140@@ ,000 people have a heart attack each year and one quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls which form plaque .
when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot that c@@ logged the flow of blood to the heart , causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots loose , it can flow through the flow of blood and clo@@ g the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots unlikely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all those who have suffered a heart attack have a further heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in to reduce further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased to be able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness blo@@ om election fraud in Muslim regions
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ let Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year for the release of a government report
a culture of political rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally acc@@ uses the police , election observers and town councils to have ignored proof of election abuse on account of &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an ant@@ cor@@ rup@@ tion@@ ist , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set shut @-@ off tapes outside of electoral boxes in order to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should have a passport to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present a vot@@ er must call his name and address . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person &apos;s finger when they release their bal@@ lot to prevent someone choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , &quot; says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the East of London .
last year , a special electoral commission decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal manner &quot; and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious obligation of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which one person was chosen as someone else .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he particularly vo@@ iced alarm on the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including conducting ID cards to prove his identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people , in order to vote according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with a Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... State institutions had know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour on the basis of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; sensi@@ tivities concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric proposed 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban on political activists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; editing electoral cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral harv@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report considered by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters prior to choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prohibition that political activists process complete let@@ ter@@ elections and envel@@ opes of letter sel@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have the authority to shut down barriers for electoral stations .
a change of law facilit@@ ated by an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 repres@@ sive act ( 1983 ) .
prohibition of photography in election stations .
requirement that only English may be used in electoral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training in order to ensure that the employees rule out that voters go to the electoral cabin on their own .
Sir Eric drops across the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let fall no criminal complaint was filed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral commission has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty according to the high requirements of criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the city halls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election registr@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country is a proud legacy as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have fallen apart from the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , who has proven to be an impressive double @-@ player of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic athlete is by far not the only athlete who has a gold fighting athlete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has compiled a list of Olympi@@ ans that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
apart from Kate &apos;s Doppel@@ gänger on the run@@ way , many people on the Internet showed how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison caused a storm on Twitter after pictures depicting the Wolf of Wall Street Star appear in a secret similar way .
in fact , the ar@@ cher received the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity except the facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I think it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the all@@ uring simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes should be able to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
a step higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Theatre
another ongoing comparison was drawn between tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va has more than just sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resemble an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face and face
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the simil@@ arities .
put theory into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and face .
other popular compar@@ isons include Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile reminiscent of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; like a pig died &quot;

Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; like M@@ ief was off &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off , when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m , he was able to give his own opinions .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS &quot; comment@@ ator team to give more colour , could be said : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
excit@@ edly , as low as M@@ ief , he died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Mu@@ h@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming staff@@ el 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which made it possible for Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the tone and language
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Does the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just say that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ in from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot didn &apos;t get that they were still on stream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Mu@@ han Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism of By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , in which many were talking about it
Twitter users were not back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # mentioned .
shortly afterwards , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast , exc@@ used live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; We are sorry that the comment on a floating power was broadcast . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for 90 times in the people responding to the B@@ emer@@ kt about Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other t@@ witter users who compla@@ ined about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and released a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible that they will be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday night we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
yet they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron is very sorry for what he said .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s pool in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the shop
the buyers did not know where they were supposed to look , when a woman drew her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants .
to make the situation worse , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed how she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back on the shelf .
she continued browsing and rehear@@ sed four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the mark store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back on the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own stock@@ ings and pants and tried her .
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously did not like , as she laid her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three further under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , put her back and go out .
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone - or to think about the person who could possibly buy the under@@ pants she had tried . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you think that someone would take home pants that had another person and which were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after it went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and moved out and she hadn &apos;t been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect against weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Verb@@ andes in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer around for your predat@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you approach you from behind , then you should turn out to be first , so you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the shooting line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then grab the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
strike it with the knee in the l@@ ath and twist while the attack@@ er bin@@ ds with pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while they judge the weapon on him .
for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and twist it , so that the aggres@@ sor cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi pre@@ tends .
but remember that it is the saf@@ est thing to over@@ do your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ uts his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a travel guide
a British trav@@ eller sub@@ mits his immune system and th@@ rot@@ tle of a serious test by le@@ vering some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k fired his course on a euro note , a hand@@ rail at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a sink of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the immunity of his immune system .
before finishing each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved .
but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Stren@@ g@@ th &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the idea of de@@ cking the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a tow@@ ing toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey across Europe Mr. W@@ right talked to doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he le@@ aked , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test his bow@@ el &apos;s resistance by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ings at stations to fl@@ ushing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task has definitely placed his immune system under a test
in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he was definitely satisfied with his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test sample showed a lumin@@ ous number of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ance number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet to refuse to de@@ file after its lumin@@ ance number was over 4000 units whereas freshly washed hands show less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Stren@@ g@@ th , &quot; which shows the number of bacterial counts in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is the worst thing I &apos;ve sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I won &apos;t lick anything here because it &apos;s disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Stren@@ g@@ th &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company is equi@@ pping Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that concluded that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Give us Ian calls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I lost my respect for Ian , if he would have liked to lick some of the things I ordered him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to put Ian to lick her and others where it was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents were associated with lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destro@@ ys social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their home after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ tion with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 , because it had terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
when they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls showed pier@@ cing holes , wooden boards were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was spread on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared onto the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the management of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I believe people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is believed to be considered as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added , street fights with bas@@ eball bat , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ ams , disputes and cur@@ ses included .
Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old garbage was found
in the estate where drugs were used in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn up
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing designed her and her partner by force of the estate this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the delegation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their lives were made hell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were not afraid of anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we say to the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we &apos;re not used to that !
now that they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said it would have had the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years .
on the over@@ grown side of the community room garbage and old toys were thrown down
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant has agreed to accept any responsibility for her behavior and family , as del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be horrible for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and gave us the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .

after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the house walls were covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says they will del@@ ve tenants who do not stick to house rules
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall informed Angela C@@ row that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach as well as to those who were har@@ med by such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate any criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal pan@@ i@@ cked after an ti@@ ring military jet flies over the beach
sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a Portugal &apos;s P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ plane Air@@ craft Plan@@ ned an incredible pl@@ unge flight
the air forces announced that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no safety risk
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after having a ti@@ dy jet over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost near the sun worshi@@ pers on the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers j@@ umped up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle gear , without seeing first what came to them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice , and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane crashed on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said the jet flew somewhat deeper than usual due to bad visibility due to the poor visibility of the area , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety was at no risk at all .
area fires destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where also four people came to death on Madeira Island .
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot had to fly as low as possible due to the circumstances - heavy fog and smoke smoke - which restric@@ ts his view
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with concerns about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup out against FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash rises three days later in Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ winner has to ren@@ ounce N@@ ey@@ mar in conjunction with the under@@ stated cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing Europe league champion , who is playing the Olympic soccer tournament in Brazil .
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e is missing .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , with which Bar@@ ca &apos;s interro@@ gation at least for the time being clari@@ fied in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
for the past two years , the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete for status as number one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coach Luis En@@ rique has so far ren@@ ounced a clear decision and made Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen is the winner in most of the remaining applicants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the first mandatory game of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness level of the Spanish master , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
even at 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ s@@ alt@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convincing .
Sevilla , on the other hand , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims to triumph in the second triumph of the Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana .
with so far , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
Ma Long in a separate league of table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; title def@@ ender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) .
thus the world rank@@ ings first took the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes on World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and the Olympic Games .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese managed to get into the final game as expected and made the title one among each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would catch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top of the Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone at the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches with themselves .
they had pulled themselves back on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ é@@ ances on their own in a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have played the Mat@@ ches up to here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the finale I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said fol@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ il@@ ateral one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 year old opponent only in the first set .
after that he set the tempo on the plate , leaving Z@@ hang only a total of 13 points .
through the su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of Ma &apos;@@ n &apos;t the expected ro@@ using match was developed .
but nevertheless enough breathtaking b@@ ale changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the bronze game against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an educated a rib@@ bed injury , and after that he was in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately , &quot; had to be content with sheet metal .

Donald Tru@@ mp ad@@ mits ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditionally conservative federal states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now gave his election campaign short@@ com@@ ings in the up @-@ to @-@ date republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals from the race within the own republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing .
&quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp to evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in key states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
due to false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media .
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds w@@ ob@@ ble
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ ul , from June , Tru@@ mp and his rival from the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton , were in@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally .
other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview by the CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question as to how he wanted to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either will be successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he makes no difference &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it was not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that was al@@ right , said Tru@@ mp .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Tru@@ mp party is supposed to have threatened to cancel funds to support its campaign , it should not be able to present a better survey .
instead of this , the Repub@@ lic@@ ans &quot; candidates for Congress want to take more attention to the poor .
Olympia : thir@@ teen Sc@@ am in dop@@ ing test
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee in the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ken@@ yan athletes face death after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics .
Kenya sent a coach home after an attempt at a dop@@ ing test in the Olympic village .
the International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan officials informed that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red .
this was reported to the Ken@@ yan team leader by dop@@ ing inspec@@ tors .
the IA@@ AF association has requested the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigation , distributed an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF explanation .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red , rehear@@ sed and signed , &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s chief de mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list for training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan team leader Michael Rot@@ i was withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against cash payments athlete of his country .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at the Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special supervision at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing contracts .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Games , it was unusual to note that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted .
before the summer games in Brazil , the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law passed a few weeks before the Olympics .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya took part in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is conform with WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were raised over and over again that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ru@@ gs .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had hired them in the field of Russian athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it was possible to prove that this sport was area @-@ covering and systematically decreased .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Mary as a youth room .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Philharmonic under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members with nostal@@ gia her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
firstly , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says in her song : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and bright and bright . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is therefore clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with it .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up to date : &quot; in this piece it &apos;s about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ pp@@ ans went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same topics and they are just as significant today as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British ma@@ ids left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air strike in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ werk of the Group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and died shortly after her family &apos;s specification of leaving the war @-@ torn country and returning to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks that are associated with going into a war zone - stopping people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other ma@@ ids from the east of London went to a plane in the direction of Turkey , followed by a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tana &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says that in the case of a election victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the candidate of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have been blocking Finland &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
on Thursday , Rei@@ d said during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain amount of certainty . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said he hadn &apos;t talked to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he was spec@@ ulating .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .

Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine is working with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to make a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people they want to find the next generation of model models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us early this year that his nude magazine from Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys is distingu@@ ishing as &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is of the opinion that the calendar also does .
&quot; we must return to the portra@@ yal of timeless and classic n@@ ak@@ ness , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release for the release of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at the open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t suit himself and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close foundation Di@@ alogue and Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons short @-@ term with tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term it could even become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; believes the leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard work of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short run , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of refugees from Turkey in the medium term if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already over@@ taken Kurdish strongh@@ olds with sanctions two months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds escape Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the dec@@ ei@@ ving coup , secular and opposition ethnic Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will start anew in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that absor@@ bs refugees in its own country produces refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the association depl@@ ored the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
in this way , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or expelled in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of association called for the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , above all Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len @-@ trailer will destroy teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t suit himself and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and secular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper , relying on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum seekers recognised in Germany due to political persecution .
on the reporting date June 30 , these were 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and there@@ with almost 29 per cent of all accepted as asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this elevation we do not find those who are fighting against war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where it hur@@ ts , &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia shouldn &apos;t vote for the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
in 2021 , the state election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for stupid as up to now it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and agricultural class struggle - that is all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the natives , who are to be convinced by the poll@@ s , are on holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers travelling in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not local residents , so they are not allowed to choose the land tag .
there are practical problems : hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count out votes at the end , only troubles@@ ome .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern needs to pass an election campaign almost by the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting is how newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive electoral campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as his legendary word@@ smith Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , seaf@@ aring has got cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame on the blossom@@ ing of Af@@ D .
her refugee policy , her &quot; We create this , &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office .
the CD@@ U , with its peak channel data , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is to make electoral campaigns at the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice invited chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations ; Merkel &apos;s German election circle is located in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority of other states , &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR .
but it &apos;s too bad anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
apart from that , the north @-@ east CD@@ U largely eliminates the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the Union has noticed that you ro@@ ar the ground on the ground so that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again .
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any in the expan@@ ses of the country .
the advice of the CD@@ U @-@ vot@@ er Kok@@ ert to his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : bri@@ de@@ fi@@ sts , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were la@@ gging behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD won still clearly at 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent ahead of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Party , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should make the leap into the country &apos;s day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the need of holidays and largely transfer their election campaigns to the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online Elec@@ toral Camp@@ a@@ ign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green electoral fighters are going on search for domestic stimul@@ ants among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg@@ ís lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
there is nothing to complain about on the speed with which the B@@ 27 will be rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end until around 20 o &apos;clock , there are all @-@ inclusive commen@@ dations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything pretty hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reci@@ proc@@ ity of those responsible for the construction works is also commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to furnishing public transport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and the block of asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and the connection to Rot@@ tenburg was restored , the traffic situation within the village was relaxed .
the citizens can now travel from the B 27 from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen on both sides .
the ev@@ asive movement through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there have been considerable complaints , &quot; says the deputy chief executive officer Florian King responsible for the management of the refurb@@ ishment .
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ ws were looking for and more familiar with their navigation than the signs .
what led to the failure of a number of trucks in residential areas .
since the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality exac@@ erb@@ ated the M@@ ös@@ singen ground vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable exc@@ esses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who himself informed himself about the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been infl@@ amed .
the quick@@ est was on the way with 77 kilometers per hour in the speed 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to revenue breaks at them makes everybody who asks you to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences .
in the car deal@@ ership , Thomas Sul@@ z also talks about a &quot; at most slight drop , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that obviously &quot; the record is missing . &quot;
the most heavily mined are the bars along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only did it , but all the restaurants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we must be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue figures on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; street structuring took its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back two years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to release half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt asser@@ ted on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the suggestion that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location at the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where so much more generous has been handled .
with all the complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
he can understand that other regular guests are now less frequently visited because of the complicated traffic management .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also elsewhere beautiful .
the fact that his family @-@ list comes back to the end of the renovation works , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction on his customers for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ term history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s brutal .
in the name of the fight against terror , laws are constantly being scre@@ wed on to laws .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now lays out a thick security package .
but what has a level of tolerance to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the ser@@ ge@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anyone .
other , more detailed points would first be discussed within the parties .
I &apos;m also involved in this .
but as the Minister of the Interior , he was based on results and at a &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition .
after recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has won a short time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but now they are all the more extensive .
some have already known , announced , filed : that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU guidelines on passenger information and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies is equally uns@@ ur@@ prising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère will start a second trial for proposals not to be made with the SPD yet : he wants to impose sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still believes this is reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chances in the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they have in some cases in themselves : he plans rapid proceedings for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for detention of people before deportation .
refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a safety review .
in the case of toler@@ ation for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse , such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of these are politically and legally hei@@ gh@@ tened .
some things are still un@@ fulfilled and leave questions open .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , given the high numbers of refugees , many people were worried about security .
and things that pro@@ found@@ ly employed people didn &apos;t let themselves be cl@@ inging up at election times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inner security has moved into focus enormously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD are increasingly turning to the issue of inner security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days , the two parties went up high .
only a gar@@ den@@ some dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the resort chiefs also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double nationality .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a stop away from the double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
it does not make sense to re@@ construct it .
and in case of a bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it has yet to show itself .
there is a lot of things that could cause controversy .
but at the moment the SPD is trying to pro@@ long the issue of inner security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further enhance security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Volkswagen gets off lightly .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , delivery rates are rising worldwide .
but it does not run smoothly in all markets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a term in the recall campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen starts the second half of the year when it comes to delivery .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , VW &apos;s core brand slow@@ ed above all in Western Europe and thus again stressed the total sale of the Da@@ x @-@ listed company .
in July , the VW brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year .
sales alone in Western Europe , the second most important market in China , were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
sales of marketing Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July especially to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some key markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote also bur@@ dened the exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ gas @-@ type first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected family brand of the Lower Saxony got off lightly by the diesel sc@@ andal . after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales director Fred Kap@@ pler was able to further develop a sales division from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated a software emission test .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million vehicles to convert into workshops .
in the course of the conversion VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects .
after conversion of vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power .
after retro@@ fitting , the car manufacturer grants the customer a &quot; guarantee rental &quot; certificate but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was said on Friday in business circles .
the reason is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport has confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after retro@@ fitting has not taken place and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen is able to see that for example , half a year after retro@@ fitting , customers can get into a workshop for example half a year after conversion , and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
in the case of customer interest , it is important to avoid that there is uncertainty about possible warranty regulations in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the gas sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see is a second institute in Germany from rich savers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bank principal Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks talks about an individual case and does not see a signal in it : ordinary savers have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not fear to pay for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks are spending money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay 0.@@ 4 percent of p@@ uni@@ tive interest .
this fee is required by the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund starting in September of private and corporate customers for deposits of over € 100,000 on deposits or day @-@ to @-@ day accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100.000 Euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been holding 40 million euros for some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the next , and that he could not recy@@ cle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and generate 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie down for every million 4000 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the cost now goes on .
to leave the cash in the banks of Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the CFO .
most customers could have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically resili@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their bank account fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian Volks@@ bank and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay comprehensive fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is a little more luxuri@@ ant with wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently no other banks are known to calculate a compensation rate for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federation of German People &apos;s B@@ anks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative for private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and there is a threat to the migration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany won &apos;t notice that in width .

before you make a part of the comment section in order to see him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Alle@@ e Men &apos;s Middle Age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the frequently discussed resur@@ gence of records is not attributable to a boom in millenni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record sellers tend to retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .

although the heart of Soh@@ o slowly stands in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling up the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist stores .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , to whom I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle aged men ) in Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men of middle aged , a woman , probably around the 20th ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 s@@ labs .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , put out the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford , when they appeared and again to buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought I was a little too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my truck .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets may apply to You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media track , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records .
from the conversations I have conducted , people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy their CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record shops offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers , objects that call for happy reminis@@ c@@ ences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s as a collector so and I think it &apos;s like that for many people .
it is a simple way to mentally occupy yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff fl@@ utes from a pile of plates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to .
the survey also found that 41 % have record players whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while browsing through a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three men of middle aged ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone just recently came in and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record so I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ friendly , less music @-@ like .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have record players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who come in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the vinyl records almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience than I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts offers latest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ tant pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks odd but na@@ iling psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to find when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it is more of a window @-@ bum@@ per than a big shopping experience .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting sheets is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it casts off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I &apos;m preten@@ ding to wear jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who gather for a moment to group Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record art &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as boards .
even if my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female colle@@ cti@@ bles that exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with the bum@@ ble@@ bees on Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by panels , while they avoid the star@@ ring look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old , false moder@@ ator who rises above the shoulders of anything of middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects supply of demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle , where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais claimed that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops where people within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture also argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy where no taxes would be paid and that would pose a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary shops , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the collapse was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is commonly operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum facts for the hundreds of needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a catastrophe for those children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle @-@ bearing living has increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - following a steep increase in newcom@@ ers throughout the summer .
despite the Olympia Dis@@ appointment : Martin remains fighting
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic cycling race , Rad@@ sa@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get lost .
&quot; I keep in mind the World Cup , stay confident and fight on , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly say it &apos;s hard to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyse in peace what reasons for de@@ bac@@ le would have led .
at the World Cup in Qatar in October , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who lost on Wednesday 5@@ 4,5 km more than three minutes at Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian C@@ anc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

group increases with start @-@ up for live video game transfers
watching other people playing video games is a giant - it also wants to benefit from Microsoft .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which specializes in this hobby .
as much money goes for the tak@@ eover , Microsoft didn &apos;t share on Thursday .
Be@@ am started his bid in January and has already more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also pick up yourself .
for example , they can give players missions and face enemies as well as provide equipment .
the Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard is launching a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sports .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ er has to adapt to the next generation of speed sensors : in different federal states , including Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash@@ guns are being tested which are to be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic @-@ looking reinforcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident spots where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , at highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary speed control , there is often no necessary infrastructure in order to ensure that the speed limit is met with a stationary bl@@ ender .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days for continuous measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded at the same time across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans to time , strip and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the high @-@ prop@@ elled condition , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer .
in order for it not to be cl@@ amped easily , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and , by the way , slip @-@ proof outer shell disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter against v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain brings silver in the 7 @-@ se@@ ater Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gold hol@@ lows
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium .
Fi@@ ji issued a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back , scheduled and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal in any color .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back to it in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji could have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in its best form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least one br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal on his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GB had a difficult path behind them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
eight years ago they lost every game under R@@ yan at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this flap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and dropped the attacks of G@@ Bs for fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if you were running in driving bus@@ ses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was shaking in the corner .
with even four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 12 @-@ 0 and GB has barely touched the ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a cl@@ ums@@ y ch@@ ack@@ le from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third gate , but Fi@@ ji only stopped it .
in the seventh minute , Z@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ova put a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed through other weak Tac@@ ch@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while the UK is still home .
this is how it is .
GB led fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes what was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time until Joshua tra@@ cked Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the southern sailors , whose fans sang , flags wave and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ am put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked sm@@ ashed to the grass .
earlier on that day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a short semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown raised the Bo@@ ks in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by a fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ in@@ ale gold than with these games and that wants to be called .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard si@@ eves that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
the echo of the coach Robin Williams was present when she row@@ ed for the second Olympic runner in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports , who made such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , at least her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ defeated bet , which is also un@@ paralleled .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph .
behind every gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make up the incre@@ mental progress that makes the difference , and no one was more useful than the coach , who didn &apos;t know if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case that under such circumstances is the right term .
I needed money , so I had to go better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve @-@ stri@@ cken morning talking somewhat more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
st@@ anning who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan said , &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much that means how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you goes to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person to train or better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race over the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much reserve in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something great .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV expl@@ orer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary clarity provided for 31 years
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , will reti@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association counts as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ wide exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water utility model for the big water producers .
some time ago , it was called the original sound in a contribution by the Bavarian Radio .
a little later the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia appreciated the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who had been a member of the Ken@@ nel Club for 31 years , stands for 28 years as managing director .
now he was reti@@ re at the age of 65 .
the water supply association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , annually promotes about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are Kirch@@ ner , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ah .
there are water delivery contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current Chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner &apos;s mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed a Water Ste@@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work to office and organization activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency assignments on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event , she called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchase in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the elevated tanks ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ distribution of water pipes .
there was no stand@@ still and new additions were added because water is the main food and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for more than 31 years .
he has applied himself with a lot of heart @-@ blood for his water @-@ purpose @-@ association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose @-@ association regularly as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group to the nit@@ rate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part praised Water Ste@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best wat@@ ert@@ ank and he was a faithful scar@@ f .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well @-@ construction and the restructuring of the ken@@ nel association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the pipe quar@@ ry at church lou@@ der on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work through the whole night at minus 17 degrees , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because one filled the elevated tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed she must die .
but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well forward and now learn privately in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something two years ago , when I sang at La Scala in Milan , he re@@ members nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est person on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the Bass@@ bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10 : 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district of Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and mort@@ ally wounded her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself inv@@ oked and stated to have shot his partner of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , he will be publicly prosec@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could travel by car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a smooth .
in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
those who see Sven S. should call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship @-@ state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the cul@@ pri@@ t in 1981 .
the competent police in Lü@@ beck initially did not want to make statements about the di@@ re or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but she affir@@ med that a human being had been killed .
&quot; it is a killing crime . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not say more at this moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ shaken and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in the millions .
financial burdens that threatened the sector from green electricity support are from the table .
it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energi@@ es Survey at the existing systems for so @-@ called self @-@ electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption , to the cash desk .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry has threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel mills are replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent falls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even this will not be raised in the steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ electricity generation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the status quo of the previous scheme is largely determined .
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts have been of particular importance for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe is suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy when the world &apos;s largest producer in China threw masses of steel onto the world market in the face of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel corporations price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased somewhat .
on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel show effect , and on the other hand the economic prospects in China have risen .
it is unclear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude the closing of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , German steel manufacturers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the quantity produced went back to the second month in a row .
production has been around two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure since the beginning of the year .
thanks to an improved order situation , the Association anticip@@ ates an increase in orders in the coming months .
community , spirit , health : singing senior good
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in teacher education she took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing is moving me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and altogether more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and mind .
for singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Senior Championships .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , senior citizens can soci@@ alize and nur@@ ture social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to leave and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for this reason , senior citizens train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs are not as fast out of the powder in everyday life .
even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for older people , Sing@@ ing often has a very special effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Labour community of senior citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
through song lyrics and especially melodies , people with dementia reli@@ ve themselves on long back events .
when singing , a special performance is demanded from the head , explains L@@ enz .
concentrate on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for something for a long time , I will get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , there is enough .
those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing men , who can hear if there &apos;s a sound coming next ?
in search of the appropriate offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings of the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior choir , you can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leaders .
many sen@@ iors can also be found via the Internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the internet research .
who wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to any age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than tom@@ cats at the scre@@ ams of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens on adult animals has .
to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also didn &apos;t leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to females .
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al degree of k@@ itt@@ ens at the mi@@ lieu of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , which are in great need , as scientists from the veter@@ inary university and the Medical School of Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) have found out .
han@@ go@@ vers also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young animals for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H .
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens is different with the ur@@ gency of its depen@@ dency .
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a pack of little ones who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more strongly arous@@ ed k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers maintain their results despite the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who haven &apos;t had their own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loudspeaker when the rep@@ ut@@ ations of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens were playing .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males ever re@@ acted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already analysed the reactions of women and men on baby sounds .
some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski gra@@ bs with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a football legend in Turkey .
a arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey , an important football match was held in Turkey .
in front of the Du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ky@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul at the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even in the suspension of the state of emergency after the uprising in July , the government , the everyday life of ordinary citizens , should not be com@@ promised .
but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the Movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
it is also not done before football .
the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office issued an arrest warrant against former Stark@@ ie Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
according to this , the Southern Co@@ ordin@@ ator living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ver is said to be supporters of Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency suspended for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact it has no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country declared Erdo@@ gan an end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the &quot; Bes@@ ik@@ tas &quot; club traditionally do not belong to the president &apos;s friends .
but what unites the Gro@@ s of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ky@@ tas .
at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; especially Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski will arrive .
with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing season as top scor@@ er of his club .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered on him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record champion has a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; leave too early in the Europa League .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g it reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better .
above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez who , with 26 season figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ rent King , laid the foundation for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez borrow@@ ed at the AC Florence and only le@@ aned Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt did not intend to return on account of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club Princip@@ al Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to abandon nearly a third of his estimated annual financial year worth 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have still med@@ als of med@@ als at Olympia in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin had been locked twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers Julia Step@@ an@@ ova can &apos;t start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh at it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines of the Rio Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had pla@@ gu@@ ed her starting right before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , ki@@ cked off and bu@@ o@@ ed mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
there was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with an aw@@ k@@ ward smile she was still standing in the hall and provoked her appearance .
when it was clear that she was not going to collect gold , the audience broke out into a rush @-@ storm .
but there are many more athletes who start the Olympic Games in Rio despite the dop@@ ing past .
here &apos;s an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked two times for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion travelled even faster than before , he is the number one in the world in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m from Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to leave a six @-@ month lock@@ out after taking the pain medication Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had severe tooth@@ ache after an operation , and the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended her .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , World Champion of 2013 and European Champion , was tested positively on the forbidden stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity and was locked for six months .
the four wi@@ dest th@@ rows this year go to the account of the big gold favorite .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and had been closed for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , bet@@ tered Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : probably hardly an athlete has been recognized as many med@@ als afterwards .
Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
in 2004 , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to bid for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title in 2006 for testosterone abuse .
he also received the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games because of a judgment of the International Criminal Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world ranking list .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record holder and gold favourite was tested positive only in May but may nevertheless start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion indications have been found for taking a banned food supplement , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA was mild and ran already on July 13th .
bom@@ b@@ alling terror in Thailand - injured - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered from cuts and had been treated in hospital but I have already left it .
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
it is still unclear whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens .
in this respect , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Nightlife two bombs .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian woman , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning another two explo@@ sives went high , another human being killed , according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
the det@@ on@@ ation near the Pat@@ ong beach , which was popular with tourists , was injured by taxi drivers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban worker .
according to the authorities , the explosive charge went into the air in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south@@ western coast and in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ eastern coast demanded several wounded .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , that was called .
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ eth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning ahead of journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express oneself on possible motives - but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern that is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist revol@@ t movement or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities had kept secret information about upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they would not have been informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks .
the police advised their officials throughout the country to reinforce security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are still small bom@@ b@@ ings , but most of the time they are not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in there is a palace used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
following the well @-@ known bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs insi@@ sts on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high safety risk ( level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after clas@@ hes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travel in these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives the military great influence over the coming years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos , while the country moves toward stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , benefits itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order .
however , it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack on the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has come into the sight of the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several national offices , the constitutional protection workers have also set up the Group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we see the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; evidence of aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; said Constitutional Manager Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aten of the German press agency in Berlin .
thus , immigrants Islamic faith or the Middle East will be diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist fashion .
that is why we observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional protection in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - are already monitoring the &quot; identification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that his authority was closely aligned with the state offices when deciding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Princip@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to speak with you@@ thful language , often with pop music .
that would do Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a concrete advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there were reports on contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , he did not have any knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
possible contacts of this species are only relevant for the constitutional protection from a certain point onwards .
it depends on whether the party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and so is extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor here is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the significant increase in legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps , Ma@@ arten said he would not yet speak of new right @-@ wing terrorism .
but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ wing terrorism .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may be possible that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee attacks or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism cannot be seen .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
he expressed concern that many transgres@@ sions went to the account of people who had not appeared in the right @-@ hand scene before .
this is the wor@@ rying concern .
many of the susp@@ ects during attacks on asylum accommodation had not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right @-@ wing scene .
&quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different , or voted for example , CD@@ U , SPD or Left , who then radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records do not always determine the head@@ lines of the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly superior s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia flo@@ ated so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was chosen .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first course with a 48 @-@ second return and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 year old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries more known .
since most sports@@ men run in orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ cs , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the rounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ bel of the whale &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made fun of him .
his time , he only struck with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter fre@@ estyle , played no role there .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to play alone in a run over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was f@@ ren@@ etic at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim before the Olympics for eight months and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop on the new place has been stolen .
according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in had left her business on Monday at 5.@@ 30@@ pm and forgot to close a window on the ground floor .
when they came back at 8.@@ 15 a.m. the next morning , around 250 Euro had disappeared from the cas@@ hier .
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
Tru@@ mp does not see the im@@ pending electoral defeat so tight
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp is speaking at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp has already an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Tru@@ mp is losing US presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either fold or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC .
if it was not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that was al@@ right , said Tru@@ mp .
thus he called US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance formed .
mail enters the trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter as well .
in short , the Group plans to start trade with the transpor@@ ter .
the Post intends to offer its electric transpor@@ ters also on the free car market from the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to go to third parties in the sale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they want to sell their self @-@ developed street sco@@ ot@@ ers , with the letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell to other farms .
post @-@ Managing Director Jürgen Ger@@ d said there are always repeated inquiries , such as craftsmen .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn @-@ based company plans to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly .
in post @-@ factory manufacturing , the company plans to construct up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and long @-@ term change@@ over@@ s to environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
G@@ FR@@ P leadership decreases after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K made it clear that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more uncertain , the longer the success achieved by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the resignation of the company management , the world &apos;s number five of the industry is facing a new beginning of staff .
the G@@ FR@@ P CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , will already leave the supervisory body with effect from September 12 .
as early as September 1 , the management board of the Board of Directors will take up the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ jer@@ ck@@ inger , informed the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the role of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spokes@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor to Hart@@ mann has been found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man on Friday did not want to mention details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who will run the market research company in the future is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in investor circles it was said on Friday , at the shareholders the disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago was great .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring are still not to be seen even after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the most recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholders will at some point become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this were the case with BMW , that would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company could not stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at EUR 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were 6.1 percent lower than the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
sales in the first half of the year declined by 3.4 percent to EUR 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million .
in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter was mainly due to the lower value of the company .
the Group &apos;s value depreci@@ ation of EUR 139 million , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience Business Unit , gave the Group a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K had generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - bus sli@@ ps in cro@@ oked cro@@ iss@@ ants in dit@@ ches : eight injured
in case of an accident of a travel coach with 43 elderly passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ horn ( district of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered serious injuries and reported the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus from a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade her details from the opposite , which drove partly on the opposite track .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the Police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said .
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance car came to the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the unexpected travellers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Kru@@ mm@@ shor@@ n district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the trucks and potential witnesses to report to the police .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic metre of waste water amount to 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ tem@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will rise again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a heavy calculation , the sewage price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the approval of the budget by the District Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach was determined that under@@ cover for these sewage treatment plants expi@@ red .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ bah market is obliged to operate the plants cost @-@ effectively .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let .
the fees are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Head of Administration Herbert Schmidt explained to the board , a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period between October 2016 and September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ cover from the previous calculation period can be assumed .
Schmidt explained the serious fee increases for relatively small installations with a very low waste water supply , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , due to the small distribution basis , expenditure for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would be grave .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , in the rec@@ umbent calculation period for all three plants , not least due to their age renovation and repair expenses were incurred in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the plants for the world , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years .
Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the sewage plant Az@@ endorf .
after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage plant had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the low waste water supply in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were &quot; fully struck . &quot;
in addition , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the waste water systems in the past 20 years , has been spar@@ ed .
in view of stone houses , the situation for the above @-@ mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long run , especially since the supply area of the sewage disposal association Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al cannot be extended by these facilities because it is a deficit .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that in July , inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first above zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % have been posted .
the annual mean inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amounted to -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % compared with July 2015 .
in July 2016 , a rise in price of the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices stayed as pre @-@ mo@@ at with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Snap@@ chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ effect is critici@@ zed as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are non @-@ blo@@ ated , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that produce more than 30 million better sel@@ fies a day .
all ab@@ norm@@ alities get to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have gone cri@@ tique in the past where they were accused of propag@@ ating the application black@@ face or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week a few users suggested a filter which gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and dark che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature from Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish face . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and indignation were widely spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat shared that it would have disabled the feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was meant as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders , who experienced racism , reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the an@@ ion compar@@ ision .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet about the photos became widespread , that the filter &quot; hur@@ ting and mil@@ dly said uncomfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very reluct@@ ant Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not gel @-@ proof , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the degra@@ ding extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride of pride .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - those in terms of race di@@ vers@@ er than their older counterpart - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ tern creates a picture that is offensive to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things stay un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for media and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that rapid @-@ based controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu also critici@@ zed the mostly white male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either she has no representation of people with other skin colors in her staff , so she can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chin@@ es@@ ich @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that the Snap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , the Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company recently hired a personnel manager focusing on sub @-@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu , on the other hand , said that she will have their Snap@@ chat account closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence information , states committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command modified intelligence service to draw up an optimistic view of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground , a committee of inquiry made its report on Thursday .
the P@@ rel@@ im@@ inary Report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Members of the Army Com@@ mittees , Secret Service Com@@ mittees , and the Army Budget Committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , just cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence information posted by high @-@ level Cent@@ com Com@@ man@@ de@@ es regularly marked a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ com range to the top of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the formation of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government spi@@ kes under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts watched the pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than facts , &quot; the report stated .
for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ si could start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans launched the task force after they were admitted that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed insights as the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ com reports are underway through the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ com created an exc@@ essively restricted trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest level demo@@ crat in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; gave too little room for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the democr@@ ats gave no reference to a White House intervention at the Cent@@ com analy@@ st regarding a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the investigation were published on Tuesday by The Daily Be@@ ast .
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation into the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , who were accepted after complaints by Cent@@ com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the reports of the Congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor was still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by an American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
the alle@@ gations of last year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the disputes of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush envis@@ aged only a small occup@@ ying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in revol@@ ting against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker states that contrary to the statements by the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ er commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for its exc@@ essively positive app@@ rais@@ al of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US is winning fourth match in the women &apos;s field @-@ hockey , a show@@ down with Great Britain .
a day after they scored three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games were supposed to represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not one of the people who keep their doors in mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but she knows that : the American women lie at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain unbe@@ aten .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first @-@ placed one will take a little longer from the strong Dutch , leading the other group .
whatever the game on Saturday like , the American women have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 seats .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey player in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , as she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ around in London that we now have .
we have been able to pull the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the doors in the first half of the game with a back @-@ hand hand@@ shake .
India was without any victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled into the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guidance .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US go@@ al@@ keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , as late as it is , it is the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling constant and inevitable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod , which is passed from the cross@@ bow to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the gym@@ n@@ ast to the tri@@ athlete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s chat on the queue in the coffee shop , without listening to Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympics and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could well have been among those known names being sent to Prime Time , built up by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ na@@ sts or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not highlight any event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it rule for a long time .
but if I can mo@@ dest@@ ly make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was perceived so spar@@ ingly that many people I had questioned did not know that it is even an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had had an athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London .
jumping on the trampoline has some out@@ sider , partly because it is suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown primary school , which sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending burst - but also the grace of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite it .
the word &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means so much like &quot; stepping stone . &quot;
rising winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a series of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
according to the official Olympic programme , they are assessed according to version , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio against each other .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
medal winners have to go farther in their pursuit of gold , faster , up and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes down and back , up and down at the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also in television broadcast another je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy goal : that of the world or the Olympic record .
the target @-@ oriented striving is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel as something ti@@ ring even when looking at these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then down , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly upwards .
even here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic games can only be .
the qualification and final rounds of women will be held on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round as part of a afternoon block from 14.@@ 00 on both days .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and the obj@@ ec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner proposed recently - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey is expecting his new fan base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the US &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia were met by the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testified that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed while the police clas@@ hes with gun changes .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but during the last months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was rel@@ ent@@ less .
witnesses stated that police fired and killed demonstr@@ ators on a number of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation videos about the protests , presumably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security people beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Commission now demands a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is cher@@ ished by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dissi@@ dents being effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or sent to prison , killed or driven into the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ ñ@@ ol Tes@@ home , a teacher in Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding the power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea are rising ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line beg@@ ged hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which have been forced more or less in recent years , can exploit and re@@ arm the turbul@@ ence .
several factors explain why , after years of bit@@ ing , feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
it was only in recent years that many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate through the social media , because cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , which it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they gathered so too prot@@ esters .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia to predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economics , while explo@@ iting the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and living in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are coordin@@ ating under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos areas .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray who account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , has been prime minister until his death in 2012 at an un@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in Ethiopia for 17 years .
he was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say he was particularly well vers@@ ed in seeing early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ transparent grounds to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of poll@@ s prot@@ ested , that according to analysts apparently sli@@ pped by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the ra@@ ids that followed , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it was less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest was relatively quickly over .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train as well as their meas@@ urable progress in fighting poverty .
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal dis@@ approval of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , Prot@@ ests in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ eric city , managed by Tig@@ ray , and hatred toward the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests bring US and other western allies into a peculiar position .
the US government used Ethiopia as the basis for emergency flights over neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it closed this base .
while West@@ ern@@ ers clearly want to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his claim Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to dissip@@ ate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by saying that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would not have been serious about the &quot; founders &quot; of the Islamic State terrorist group .
this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidates whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sively with the American public .
it also brings its fellow comb@@ at@@ ants who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position of decl@@ aring statements he could not have meant at all .
having made the interpretation of an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp res@@ igned in relation to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation perfectly .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help mi@@ tig@@ ate his statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism hit Mr. Tru@@ mp as he tried to steer the focus of his campaign for falling survey data on the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this topic again .
talking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he had a strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Of course , I thought that sar@@ c@@ astically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then row back as needed .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans how they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has accepted an even more corro@@ bor@@ ated tone , as his survey values have continued to decline .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a leadership with a huge margin in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while he is in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Turkey &apos;s most prominent critics , strug@@ gled to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that in front of Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called it back@@ si@@ sts , perfectly wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton acted as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out of the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being fri@@ ghted on each of his words and to be bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , j@@ ol@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s ap@@ ologies as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
once crowded over the price of the market , Café returns to Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ amy café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were sup@@ planted .
soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s business , which was sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local inhabitants claimed it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is exemp@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it &apos;s also re @-@ discovery .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outside office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old club .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ n@@ ings like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also sup@@ planted by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in former times and visited the club regularly .
even after he moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the club had closed , she gave up the coffee drinking for a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was the coffee and culture in the club that pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even though she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he did not h@@ ass@@ le that the soap shop occupied the old business area .
in fact , the owners of the soap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will still address their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he pre@@ tended to leave it soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee into the bottle .
there is a chance that the café is expanding into an adjacent building .
for many customers a new club is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing meal of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the Pres@@ i@@ dency , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gour@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for Fi@@ fth Avenue &apos;s refined delicacies , such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land &apos;s ter@@ rap@@ in soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane brick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while bricks were told in their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
her newest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal &quot; published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag shows the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop , a small schn@@ au@@ c@@ ell@@ os@@ em snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixes .
when the re@@ porter ordered sh@@ red@@ ding , this found the couple suitable for discussing the food in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheeses and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that reaches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women co@@ ached for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked past@@ es for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget diet was equally ten@@ se : secret food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ ass@@ uring food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; noted bricks , as chefs were able to hide non @-@ appeti@@ zing ingredients in a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
peculiar compounds have been tried out as a high @-@ calorie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has priority over taste or even healthy cooking .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from that period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions are not suitable for each other .
it was typical for many of the utility recipes .
as never before or since , budget@@ ary econom@@ ists , including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 , under@@ took the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ wives &quot; and to meet the challenge of transforming P@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots in delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic delic@@ acy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly tasty are the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ food attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farming country kitchen of his kitchen , he feeds like the million dollar man of the world he has become .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ det@@ ecting dining room and had a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt would have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had called on him to cancel an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , today &apos;s house@@ keeper had no interest in flavors caused by Ms. Roos@@ ev@@ elt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs .
the legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the incident .
after the dishes were cleared by Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ ums recipe , which President Roos@@ ev@@ elt did eat at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a common plo@@ y to give modest recipes a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ ved something reluct@@ antly a spoon in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it didn &apos;t taste bad .
Co@@ E took a stop three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few hack@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has even died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a group of civilians who , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 60@@ ,000 lives .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game in order to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the conserv@@ ation@@ ist , showing him during an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero he has never seen himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the toxic rem@@ nants of the bomb to prevent children from playing with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quotes the image of his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ hairs usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland &apos;s hair is only 150 years old .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches just 1.@@ 220 meters in average .
only when it matters , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates on a full 2.@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
but this slow@@ ness lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate by a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphical research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evolutionary bi@@ ologist believed for a long time that Greenland &apos;s hair would be st@@ ony .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland @-@ hairs are hard to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures of around 6 degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s hair .
her slow @-@ motion picture shows her how to equi@@ p six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitz@@ bergen .
prey make this sh@@ arks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
perhaps they hunt down sleeping animals or pat@@ rolling at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , that tor@@ ches down from higher water @-@ layers .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland shar@@ k , the fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ res long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re was measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , the carbon @-@ 14 method analysed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks .
this centre of the ey@@ eli@@ ds appears before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had remarkably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s when nuclear weapons attempts to produce larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
with a length of 220 centimet@@ ers of the third smallest animal , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 out of nuclear weapons attempts , it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
on the other hand , all major Greenland shar@@ k had normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes in their lens nucle@@ us , which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re @-@ long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , whereas the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res was likely to be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now researchers of the length were able to assign an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined by 156 years , Greenland @-@ hair with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries @-@ time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such methane al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , in whose bacon on the neck was a 120 year old har@@ poon point , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flames .
so they mature later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are also often very big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal influences warmth .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the evolutionary bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal should , on the other hand , invest its resources in a long life .
building site in a double pack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Municipal Council has focused mainly on issues relating to construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the board received the notification made by mayor Robert P@@ utz on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently proven residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after clari@@ fying the land , par@@ cel@@ esting and settlement questions and the applications for sur@@ veying , the sale of land plots in the residential areas &quot; Stre@@ am@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße - expansion section 1 ) are no longer available for interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau attract young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors in the same way .
as it was said , building volunteers can now announce themselves in the town hall , the municipal council is expected to advise on the allocation of the plots in its September meeting .
in order to meet requests for res@@ ett@@ lement of further business enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan created in the spring of this year .
in the Lower @-@ Time area , the industrial park , which has already been proved there , is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main , therefore , has the best chances to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt profits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it v@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether funds will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , for the so @-@ called EU passport , admission to the UK is sufficient .
big US banks are making use of that .
several banks have already announced their reloc@@ ation jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight on the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervision E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Committee ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg has a big fund industry , but it also cuts down the infrastructure badly in the way it is in Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
furthermore , the city with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial properties are 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the company consulting company Mer@@ cer , the city was ranked 7th , Luxembourg at No@@ .@@ 19 , Dublin at No@@ .@@ 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a finance location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; concluded the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but London will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , my business researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal expenses from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US official ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is eligible for reimbur@@ sement of legal costs incurred by the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was freed from a compensation payment amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs called so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ wärts and other un@@ ethical acts .
when the complaint was collected on Thursday , U.S. District Ju@@ dge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the expense incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ alize with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck accused each other and took up property on laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir inf@@ ring@@ om@@ ag , active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the United States say they have reg@@ ained control over Man@@ i from the Islamic State
supported by the United States , the entire control over the northern city of Man@@ o@@ j near the Turkish border was rec@@ ap@@ tured after the last IS fighters left the city , a spokes@@ man for the group on Friday said .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) comb through the passage of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city .
they have released over 2,000 civilians , held by the comb@@ at@@ ants as ho@@ stages , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ tu@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters , al@@ lied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out clean@@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ tons deserve 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presi@@ dency candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5,@@ 3 million in free speech .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ president , Sen@@ ator Tim Imperial from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton released his tax declarations during the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Imperial continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s Camp@@ a@@ ign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion .
in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tru@@ mp hides behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ com@@ ers regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
it is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not oblig@@ ated to do so by law .
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; you &apos;re on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign assistant Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , with regards to the publication of the democr@@ ats &quot; presidential candidate .
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the tax audi@@ ts did not finish .
Turkey &apos;s critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already vo@@ iced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business forums and various other links , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday , promp@@ ting high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp to release his tax return .
on Thursday , she addressed the subject also during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ co announced that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp paid no or very little taxes , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday that could still be the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton supports a scheme named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor war@@ ts buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has its seat , Tru@@ mp invited to a meeting to exchange their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has posted tax returns back to 2007 .
the Clinton &apos;s now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the fiscal policy of the 2015 clin@@ tons showed that these only USD 100 of their income as a reward , unlike most Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings were tax@@ ed $ 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works support Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from walking in inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ y .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who had the idea for years ago , has intensified its promotion along with U.S. nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without inj@@ uring animals .
before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday is the day of the phone which is dedicated to animal welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit we were able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include illumin@@ ating the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ fest@@ ock &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end until the ignition switch is turned .
when it is lighted , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ y into the air .
a touch quite usually comes out to chase the elephant .
one last option is a row@@ er , who shoots a piece of gold in the air and causes a loud , bright explosion .
city Council unanim@@ ously decides : no new ki@@ os@@ ks at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
usually the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment projects of traders with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and are taking place - but the retail sector in the core city is considered to be significantly expanding .
however , the Municipal Council refused to accept the application for the new construction of a sales ski plant on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ kon@@ s currently under construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we welcome new traders , but at this location in exposed location on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath to the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director dis@@ cards Berlin hotel because Israeli elections were removed after &quot; Arab &quot; prompt - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he had revealed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had no list of Israeli elections as it required Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of the hotels .
the country , however , was not listed between countries that can be directly ph@@ oned out of the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and destroyed ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ wered him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was an &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind this was that the director dis@@ sol@@ ves even more fur@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cited by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and upset by this event .
this really is very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drawing the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather big resonance on the internet , where people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of them signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; give &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged invitations for Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shame you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post where it was pointed out that the hotel which is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly rejected all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; mistake &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the Quick Selec@@ tive List , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
adds that the country code is now added .
police op@@ poses tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students joined the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police launched tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the use of rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on their plans .
according to the proposals by the governor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the protest participants saw gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president Michel Tim@@ er spra@@ ying on walls .
recent protests erup@@ ted a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the exchange rate between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted , the interest in Russian companies on business in the country grew strongly , the ambassador agreed .
Russian companies are taking existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trading is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of the year by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade @-@ up@@ swing was achieved by supplies of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan continues this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian representation delivered some 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses wanted : beverage market inf@@ ested in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y happened on Thursday evening on the drink market of Re@@ we XXL to the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm three dark dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , demanded the release of cash from the staff of the beverage market and then fled at first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money was captured , the police did not share .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small .
the drink market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is not visible .
after the assault , the perpetr@@ ators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and have fled from the gravel car park located opposite the parking house entrance with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the action ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) , which are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y of the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently address the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun during fre@@ estyle
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer leisure in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quiet hamlet of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the lively group was quartered in the first week of school .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ rescue with a visit to the match @-@ zoo .
on the other hand , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group enjoyed themselves at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swimming and sp@@ lashing .
culinary delights were given to children and car@@ ers with their own cour@@ get@@ tes , such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops , you will be able to create beautiful jewels of beads and stones or made from wood a Roman @-@ mill game .
other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot;
on the day of their home journey the sun was laughing and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
sh@@ arks @-@ hole : pilgrims to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the altar boys from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage route from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were tac@@ kled .
in order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all ministers in the next two years , the senior government round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
different pilgrimage destinations have been examined and one finally decided to visit the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where a special pilgri@@ m &apos;s goal was offered during the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opened portal of mercy at the Freiburg cathedral .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ kel , were on the way .
in the evening before , Pastor Ray@@ mond sent the pilgrims at a small ceremony in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage and granted the Pil@@ gri@@ mage .
von Hor@@ b was driven by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er loved a woman standing on the pilgrimage route from Münster .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening , each with a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written lyrics .
but also on the way , the min@@ is at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeat@@ ed@@ ely made a rest for singing together a song from a specially composed pilgri@@ m &apos;s booklet .
for the nights , par@@ is@@ hi@@ on@@ ers of the local par@@ ishes were available .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a tasty and star@@ chy dinner and breakfast .
it continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the day after that , one stepped on the stage to St. Peter , which was the exhau@@ sting stretch of road , at first some 500 al@@ timet@@ ers had to be lowered and climbed afterwards .
the earned reward was a common barbecue at the bathing pond in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
the Min@@ is met visi@@ bly and happily arrived in the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and went through the gates of mercy .
with a small impulse , God was thank@@ ed here .
the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t arrived at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was time for the city tour metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end all the participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home , as Br@@ ite gold rings for cycling
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner was the last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ o@@ drome in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself . the J@@ ump made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from New Zealand &apos;s favor@@ ites .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London train world championships despite the appearance of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ dri@@ er Jamie Staff .
they did this in good time as a hind@@ ran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots , which has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who won Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner won an Olympic team in the qualification round , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was close behind after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear in order to slow down and make it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic Committee in the En@@ dr@@ unde and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the victory in 2012 on the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ der admitted that he intentionally fell on the track after a weak start .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no appeal of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the UK flags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the past three months .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle of bikes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the form identi@@ ties it is in the range of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a contest .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y who was born on 23 March ( a seemingly sacred date for the British sport ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y will take part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the quick@@ est performance in the four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record that won gold in London 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where the focus will be on W@@ ig@@ gins .
he had argued with commission@@ ers before the qualification yesterday , when function@@ aries called him to measure his height .
Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie for the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 in the corresponding women &apos;s competition .
the GB team is relying on his strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a pair of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
in the background Dra@@ mas played in the background , so the resignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton technical manager in the middle of sex and mo@@ bbing def@@ ections as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
the future of the melt by Port@@ land is doub@@ t@@ ful because of the lifting of the energy yield .
the future of the aluminium sm@@ elter from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus elev@@ ates all supply contracts as the supplying energy company .
this step followed the decision by the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years exp@@ ires in November .
up to 2,000 work@@ stations in the installation of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2,000 work@@ stations - both direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melt is consumed about 10 percent of the total generation of Victoria .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa concluded the point Henry sm@@ el@@ ting , which last year led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land lo@@ oses money and risks closure .
this step follows the years of speculation on the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the price of electricity for the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium sm@@ elter with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the complex is owned by a Joint Venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the company announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the Tre@@ aties were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging businesses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which would have been in force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month period of notice , so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L expects that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L income from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts amoun@@ ting to $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have been in force from November this year even if there is still one explanation for why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic situation of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land annually consum@@ es around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator this would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hy@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan , Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , sc@@ anned reality video that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the universally popular Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ Un@@ cle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) .
this is the c@@ lich@@ é act almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the phrase , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 am ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
Kim &apos;s big sister Kim doesn &apos;t like what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( they and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a volume resem@@ bling a picture book rather than a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were advertising by the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years , images of the magazine still se@@ ep before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there have been clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar Award Win@@ ner and brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover for 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls below the former category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even though everything applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers doesn &apos;t like success to everyone .
with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the fashion world has always been something ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ ins of the moment . &quot;
these feelings reco@@ il again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but riding around on the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ ming of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is seen in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal research centres assign a year to 160@@ ,000 people
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary services are rejected annually by the municipal research centres , while the sector refers to the impact of further central short@@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected by seeking free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services provided by the municipality , which are already at full capacity , are prepared for further cuts .
as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
the Director of the Community Centr@@ es of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people are already being rejected each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that without a suspension of the decision of the federal government , the situation would only get worse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people from key services you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who rely on violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been divor@@ ced by separ@@ ations , workers who have been divor@@ ced wrong@@ ly - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot obtain the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funding by 30 percent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance .
we urge the General Prosecutor and Federal Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in legal issues .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities and that the Government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp campaign accused after co @-@ workers allegedly drew gun
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ action , after being informed that in February , her campaign manager for North Carolina put a gun on a staff while they were on the road in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ord@@ i gave up for months to have waited for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the campaign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a pist@@ ol , put his right hand finger on the trigger and caught the run in Vinc@@ ente Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave to B@@ ord@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compla@@ ining to the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ord@@ i stated that at least four other people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate released a comm@@ otion when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment people &quot; - gun@@ men and weapons friends - should take action if his rival was elected H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judges .
Turkey &apos;s campaign made it clear that the media tore his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ord@@ i &apos;s complaint requires damages from the campaign for breach of duty of care and by Philip for bodily injury and permanent psychological damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp press spokesperson on Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a comment .
attempts to contact Philip have failed as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .
responding to calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
up to now , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has led a controversial campaign .
the procedure is B@@ ordin@@ i by Donald J. Tru@@ mp For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : poll@@ s before the elections : lose SPD and CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses are recorded for the government parties of the SPD and the CD@@ U .
this resulted in representative surveys from the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the poll@@ s in Berlin .
the SPD , however , would be the strongest party in both federal states and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party only smil@@ ed shortly before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day .
in spite of slight losses , the Green Party returned to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
the N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent each .
according to the survey , the SPD &apos;s vote would only reach 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they are still la@@ gging behind the Gre@@ ens by 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 14 percent for the first time .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , but the pirates would not miss it in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator appeared on the market .
the success@@ ors are domin@@ ating the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the tool weighed almost half a kilogra@@ m and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good at hand .
on the contrary , it was quite cl@@ unk@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes at the beginning , that would be enough today for about two sel@@ fies of high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9@@ 000@@ communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Inter@@ Net Age .
twenty years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for the standards at that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even access to web pages was possible by using HTML browsers , albeit slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be opened similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
quite proudly the price was : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could have gu@@ essed in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything has changed since then .
the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Finn@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mobile phone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold to Microsoft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , vendors are domin@@ ating the market , all of which came much later than Nokia .
being online always and everywhere today is for a lot of people &apos;s everyday lives .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users around the world .
about 1.4 billion units were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , an entire industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac World announced the introduction of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communications , all by touch screen easy to use .
the Apple triumph@@ al procession began , even today , the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look at it .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ gen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
twenty years after his invention , the smartphone is a matter of course .
today , in average every German looks every day 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to get the smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , responsible for staff at the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must drive the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London when we had a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we alone will create 10,000 new jobs , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think the challenge of the expansion He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be bl@@ amed on the world stage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two @-@ f@@ ler had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they will also lie wrong with He@@ ath@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked .
like the Olympics , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in sustainable growth and a legacy of skills and employment to leave the airport as well as in the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until the T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third run , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking
for companies that earn money with online advertising , one of the software manufacturers attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to once again block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop page would change the coding regarding its advertisements to make it difficult to identify indicators on which part of the page is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post , Ad@@ block Ben Williams &quot; spokes@@ man wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle is underway between the present@@ able open source community and the det@@ ers since the invention of advertis@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has engaged in the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe some 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks available .
the company has refra@@ ined from targeting advertising block@@ ers on desktop PCs because mobile advertising block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a spokes@@ man announced .
advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook seems to be worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; ad preferences pool &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that adding blocks would be wor@@ rying because they would block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an email communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a dull means , which is why we have concentrated on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control into the hands of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; woman with presum@@ ed suicide over@@ riding Swiss motorway &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman was transferred on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday at a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 , close to Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d , shortly after midnight .
a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss company , at the age of 49 , wanted to cross several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , to kill himself .
she died on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , &quot; said the police who asked them and every witness to the incident to sign up .
an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gil@@ les Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared with the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - in which one person was running in the dark on the highway - was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing , after having passed and killed a man who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street , took the court .
the court found that the police officer -- which had responded to an emergency call -- went on a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; perfectly exceptional and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should contact the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once inhab@@ itable
according to projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably hab@@ itable once .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to detect the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine if Venus could have rejected such conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still revol@@ ved slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably posted more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected against rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a Sun which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus exhibits its day @-@ to @-@ day side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model created a history of Venus similar to evolution that was previously thought by planet scientists .
although it was once hab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billions years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
her oceans evapor@@ ated and her water vap@@ or was fired from the ultra@@ violet light .
as their Hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as trainer of A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy rec@@ eded on Thursday as trainer and vice president of hockey at Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co@@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey at Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , needed and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations has to be perfectly matched to that of the organisation .
he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team .

Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and we wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the League .
he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the two last years the post@@ season .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell five points behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal @-@ Canadi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ oil workers resume talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles concerning wages for North Sea workers are suspended , while all parties are seated at the table for a new round of talks , &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Wood Group oil field service provider have been carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current stri@@ fe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will keep some full day sessions in the coming weeks , starting next year to address the problems .
the unions said their last strike , which was the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has cut the install@@ ments to its counter@@ parts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating shor@@ tening follows a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts would give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its operations as a result of its re@@ union with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had intensified by the British decision to leave the European Union in June .
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler World Space Teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating in the star cluster to different rates , as well as in what context the rot@@ ational periods are related to planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star companies , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated some 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the quick@@ est .
at peak @-@ rotation rates , these po@@ ison@@ ous stars rep@@ el large quantities of star winds .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is aging , its rotation @-@ rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rotation advice indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars turning slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars can slow down their rates of rotation and hang up their &quot; dance shoes &quot; so to speak .
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the growth rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star
Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez &apos;s tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional withdrawal , the 41 year @-@ old pro will wear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12th against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ times all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and a youth coach - at full salary .
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid his money back for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he has made some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be accepted into the rest hall of the bas@@ eball .
for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was on the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square .
already in 2009 the super@@ star admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; between 2001 and 2003 that ster@@ oids were forbidden .
in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the prime suspect to have received performance @-@ enhancing remedies for years via an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the barrier was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could have done me a favour in 2014 because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his farewell days are not silent as well .
while many bas@@ eball legends occupy the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job does not include goodbye tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , was given sympathy for the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the fans sang at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland can &apos;t start in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a wi@@ ped athlete would have won almost one medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the athle@@ tics competitions that were critically accepted , these news came to an end .
last Sunday , Ch@@ en demonstrated the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de , which is used as a mask @-@ absor@@ bing agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Criminal Court ( CA@@ S ) confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old gave the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly , just 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the runs over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing .
the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Criminal Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S , is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news filtered through Dan@@ ek@@ ova &apos;s positive test , while the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation might be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tics woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the banned substance is supposed to act as a blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B specimen should also have a positive effect .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately expressed his criticism of the Bul@@ letin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days before .
both of them deny the intake , but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes start , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association banned the launch of the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the field of swimming , the previous off@@ ences in China also had cat@@ astrop@@ hic conflicts between athletes .
so the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m of open @-@ air , I want to surrender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun also stood at the center of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ d@@ sters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was tested positively by the Chinese nationals in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to leave only a three month spar@@ row .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de presses h@@ acker their ran@@ som
black@@ mail programm@@ ers are currently targeting companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey by the malware resistance specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 per cent of the companies were already the target of ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 % of the victims readily paid the ran@@ som funds required by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software based on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to black@@ out ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes leader Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ ean programs were designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
the aim was not until private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was terri@@ fying rapidly in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of black@@ mail .
in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where private users find the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 per cent of German companies reported loss of revenue by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to dis@@ rupt their business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always tell the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies paying , get their data back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure investigated the user interfaces and the contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and result in the result : the cul@@ pr@@ its actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they tell their victims via chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t free sample files for free .
and if private individuals are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate sometimes hard and pay 5 @-@ digit sums to retrieve their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively low @-@ risk income from ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and sharing their work , says Security Expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the programm@@ ers then sell their malware in the form of a software module to the actual black@@ mail .
the up @-@ to @-@ date malware kits have ar@@ isen as the malware itself , counsel@@ ing , and additional tools have been purchased for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included is a fitting tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ ma@@ ids then look for further hack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
thus , one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals then commission sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ran@@ som@@ ware &apos;s risk is now known by many companies that better safeguard their data .
over 50 percent of IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to be able to ward off Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file backup and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful enforcement , the perpetr@@ ators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes leader Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the potential damage potential , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before .
in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the front row as well as in the rear compartment .
the materials of the interior are well @-@ finished and have a pleasant effect , only the top of the cockpit falls slightly .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l for raised and 10@@ 26 l for revers@@ ed back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a movie seat and offer storage space , which is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded easily , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he should do his job a bit more quietly .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
another engine is available : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the steering seems to be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City @-@ Emergency brake assist ( works up to 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
the collision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; when manoeu@@ v@@ ring .
the beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed regulator responds to road sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed when required .
the full connectivity is only available for top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI jack are located under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to reach .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda provides a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable for hazards that are typical of air traffic .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee injury during the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
disease case : when pays the organis@@ er
after their journey , ill holi@@ day@@ makers only get money back if the cause of the disease is doub@@ t@@ lessly in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms .
in the case of the case , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their leaves .
she spent almost all holiday in the room .
their illness brought the tourists back to a defective treatment plant , which allegedly polluted the sea water .
the family believed that the trip was lacking - and compla@@ ined against the organizers .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
the sewage treatment plant indeed was defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before the plain@@ ti@@ ffs arrived .
until then he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
so he did not viol@@ ate his information obligations , thus the verdict .
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion with one another - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks .
the state must be mind@@ ful and determined to react to terrorist dangers at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country will not answer the violence of perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we won &apos;t allow this triumph to the terrorists .
if offen@@ ders had to leave the country faster , it would increase the security and strength of the population for refugee policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister clearly advoc@@ ated action against action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) .

better traffic flow on the Autobahn
it st@@ ings regularly on the round@@ about - here a picture of November .
however , this should change : the legal subscription shall be extended .
this is good news for all drivers who are in traffic on the ambient road every night in traffic jams when driving over the motorway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction will extend on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 . / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer street and the exit Wes@@ er Straße the right @-@ turning track by 700 meters .
drivers can then flow directly from the hammer street to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is split up early , thus improving the overall production flow on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit was the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the car traffic con@@ stri@@ ction on the feeder is annoying , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ log goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ gh@@ ese way and sometimes beyond .
the reason is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic is only ste@@ ered one lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back more than a quarter of a century ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to absorb mainly heavy @-@ duty traffic .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated factory @-@ daily traffic jam will last , the competent regional company cannot say .
however , it is to be expected for years : because the bridge has an official remaining service life up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legislative branch , the state enterprise deliberately chose the low @-@ traffic period during the school holidays because with disabilities it is expected to be expected .
the traffic will be scre@@ ened on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of forest school attended the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the organisation N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young theatre are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Bo@@ ys Theater in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey , initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s association , 19 students from 11 to 15 years visited the staging in the Small House .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project .
most young people in the class were from September 2015 to March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and spoke little German .
thanks to the choreography , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , the press release of the Young Theater in Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background should be able to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning phase .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement
the weather has made the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany a stroke through the bill on Friday - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the Chairman of the observ@@ atory , Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning .
our hope lies on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will see many shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars at 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , that goes up in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
in the evening , one turns around forever , at night one lies awake for hours , in the morning it is far before the wake @-@ up ring@@ ing not to think of sleep anymore .
this is everything else but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep distur@@ b@@ ance and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
what are the symptoms of sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes behind them , stressed Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ert , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ eping Medicine .
but what one sees below is the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , a distur@@ b@@ ance of the in@@ som@@ nia .
just as sleeping , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German general medical association with practice in Var@@ el in Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleep problems ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
organic , mental , or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines , can be put behind it .
not in@@ frequently , sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is most common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ pex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors op@@ press each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can easily wake up , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to think about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep problems become a doctor ?
if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day , you should go to the doctor , advise you .
the impairment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or bodily complaints such as stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and no more than two weeks .
Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep @-@ medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , emphasizes the low @-@ settled sle@@ eper medi@@ cs in Germany .
for this reason , you should first contact the doctor in case of problems with sleeping problems .
this can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens ?
in order to study in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise for example snor@@ ing with respiratory suffer@@ ers , in cases of sick wear@@ iness , sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if you fail to find the cause of a sleeping disorder , &quot; Fi@@ etze . &quot;
it is not necessary to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ gans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after disgu@@ sting , one goes to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger .
a camera also records the sleeping end on the ceiling .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of screws which can be used for better sleep .
it counts on : regular sleep and standing times , don &apos;t sleep too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and don &apos;t watch at the clock at night - then you start to calculate immediately , and that is quite and certainly not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has to offer
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ zer commented on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he first picked up gold at the short@@ wave world championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time made his first world record .
the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ zer has now protected himself against his ex @-@ team @-@ mates , who are prot@@ esting against his criticism .
&quot; in a country in which an Olympic winner receives 20,000 € premium and a jungle king 15@@ 0.000 € should no one be surprised by missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night .
the transport system in the swimming pool is bad , the dop@@ ing controls , on the other hand , are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see or operate so closely on the subject of dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying that the controls should be stopped here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ zer would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) .
that &apos;s the way you should keep it with countries too .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before the World Cup / OS by independent controllers from the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; demands the choice of Hamburg , which now operates an ice cream .
airport : links of baggage claim arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
the police of the Düsseldorf Police arrested two women and two men at the age of 50 @-@ 61 years on Thursday .
the susp@@ ects committed several hand@@ bags and bag pil@@ es as a band .
at 9.@@ 30@@ pm , civil servants in the Düsseldorf airport opened a band known to police officers from past thi@@ eves .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July of this year and were in a communal , hard working and especially professional manner .
the specialists of the criminal investig@@ ator 34 can prove four acts to the thi@@ eves who had been sum@@ mon@@ ed to Germany to commit crimes .
in total , they had carried off a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look like that , but the police numbers them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes at play@@ grounds , a newly @-@ painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
someone has spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house .
in front of a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , it is already built : a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017 .
articles about this &quot; trendy neighborhood , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will , however , prefer to be bil@@ led with burning cars in recent weeks .
reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented le@@ ases , however , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
in particular , since the beginning of the year , the Berlin internal sen@@ ator Henkel has voted several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22nd , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rolled out official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three clu@@ b@@ team cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved away from sympath@@ isers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents go for a walk , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has three children here , is especially anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the residents of the house projects , they share the worry of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who , in majority , wanted police protection from lef@@ ti@@ sts .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin sen@@ ator and the police between house occup@@ iers and their neighbours open up , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which today , in comparison with the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
also house occup@@ ations and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer street near the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared under a large police charge in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and choice head@@ liners all over the world over the past few years . residents of East Germany and former land@@ owners share their neighbourhood .
this is reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : they can be recognized by scre@@ ened windows or newly painted fac@@ ades , which were dis@@ car@@ ded with color bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : crimes like body injuries are almost exclusively directed against police officers .
the biggest part of the off@@ enses put in fac@@ tual insul@@ ts , which tend to make new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a ten@@ ant next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
when it comes to violence , it is appe@@ al@@ ingly : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er any longer .
for her studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here you help each other , live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
for this reason , it was also so important for the residents to get back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the city &apos;s interpretation .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former mos@@ quit@@ oes that crowd the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well drunk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely can &apos;t approve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if someone never li@@ stens to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for drawn @-@ out people who are anno@@ yed by colour @-@ bombs : the skin projects and the left @-@ hand scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
who is coming , should be aware of it - just like someone pul@@ ls into a ta@@ vern district , can complain badly about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the management team for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact person for all stakeholders : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the honorary officials are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is here now , the egg @-@ making Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ sau , which has above all a problem .
in this way , some - less mo@@ cking - were aiming at the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write the job .
an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people was sought , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a hom@@ onymous dream of wo@@ olen milk .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says that administrative work is not her central area .
above all , it is about organizing , working with local people and behind the scenes as well as networking .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent point of time limited to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organisational , human and communication problems .
new containers are soon available in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the commun@@ es themselves .
the responsibility changes from the District Office of the municipality to the municipality and Job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
in fact , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far it does not work , so you have to rely on private apartments , according to Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common dwell@@ ings have to be sober@@ ed up as it is so beautiful .
new containers are soon to be placed in the water@@ way .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school courses , one @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ pers for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ one or set up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help house master builders , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and mainly language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so there is also administration and community of honour .
it is central that the refugees are feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses .
whoever gets the feeling that he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there are problems also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who do nothing at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve might call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins will call them completely in ob@@ itu@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
thus , main and honorary officials have to look for activities locally and in the region .
in doing so , they always have in the background that soon a new blow to refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
this question must be answered clearly , the policy is h@@ ein@@ ous .
actually it is unfair to put them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived , where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would ease the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach are already at full capacity to integrate the previous people ration@@ ally .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when men are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Baden @-@ Württemberg : police investigation for ro@@ cker attack on snacks
after an attack on a Ul@@ mer Imb@@ bite , the police are investigating six susp@@ ects from the ro@@ cker environment due to a severe drop of land peace .
in the case of house searches , evidence and ven@@ om was ensured , the police announced on Friday .
according to police in July , about 20 mas@@ ked men of a rock@@ like group@@ ing had thrown bottles and stones against the window of a snack .
after that , they were to be attacked and hurt two guests .
then they fled .
