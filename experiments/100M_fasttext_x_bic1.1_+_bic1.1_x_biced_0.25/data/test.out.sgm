<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little change with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sportpyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted at the fast gallop home to feed the fodder.</seg>

<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfers of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had his family run over the facility of the ALRV, on a horse he was not even photographing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also with CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sporthilfe handed over the gold standard pyramid to the man from Anhausen under a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">Silver bay leaf, Champions Tour Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already guessed him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th prize winner of the pyramid of sports has long been a long time.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Saturday he met the first prize laureate Hans Günter Winkler in Aachen.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this distinction means a lot to me," "" "" "" "says Langer," "" "" "" "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been promoting young people.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master winner was admitted to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The winners include the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Giffen, the fencer Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumum the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportswomen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trump economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - this is what Clinton and Trump want to do.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential judges are not one, but in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warn against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death, he says." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he will massively retract regulations and make himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes for the rich would increase, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in which it must be invested, Trump and Clinton speak almost all the same." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So, on Trump, party-internal discussions could be forthcoming.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to quit the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend and demand renewables with its investment programme: "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazilian trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade - they simply want to better protect American jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they should be paid better then," "" "" "" "says Clinton." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump is standing, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics stick to him, so that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg's Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara is most willing to reconcile this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to be slippery and he didn't radiate any heat, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" dear friend "" "" "" "" Putin - according to a report all five times. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan would have behaved as if something bad happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's brilliant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction: the surplus of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was burning.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The transgression was even greater, as it was celebrated by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the cousins becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media carried out severe unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious were the accusations of senior officials, that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clearly obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was removed from his office last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agents and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this week, the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "a report in Vedemosti quotes it as follows:" "" "" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West, as it looks at the reaction to the attempted transfer of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the ongoing resentment on the snail speed of EU membership negotiations and Putin - which is eager to derive benefits from the cool sentiment and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara on security that after the attempted coup d'etat, he called for support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is surely a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an "alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once described: two countries that have been violating and badly treated by the West and now fainting themselves.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two still.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave its role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents spoke at the press conference that they had not even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress these differences.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least again.</seg>

<seg id="13">Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-times winner Sir Anthony McCoy who scored more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester's Piggott, the nine-time Derbysieger had 4,493 career opportunities</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockey of modern times and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone that few have reached before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that differs from the others in the weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for races, enthusiasm and charisma fans for years for this sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">I said Frankie some weeks ago at Epsom that he had already scored 6,000 gains if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Frankie has already ridden almost 30 years winner, which is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">Flying finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was nerve wrecking.</seg>
<seg id="24">A whole series of grand tournaments, including his famous "Glorious Sieben" 1996 at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago, he had difficulties in the beginning when he returned from his six months' lock, but he showed an impressive character of character to defy his doubters and return to his burial.</seg>
<seg id="26">And he hasn't come to the end for a long time - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his age of at least 5.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin dampens chief of staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was many years part of Putin's tightest confidence circle.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed a Special Representative for environmental and transport opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement by the Kremlin it reads that without stating grounds, Putin has ordered the discharge of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been deputy to Ivanovo since 2012, has been appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is written (in Russian) that he later became a log chief and Chief of Staff of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "" "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your activities as head of state on bills of law and controls on the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin announced the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked me to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convinced?</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this step has made Moscow more mysterious." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest confidants Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will resign on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once touted as a potential president, at one time would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in the beginning of 2012 in a conversation, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term of office, Ivanov could become president of Russia as a third term in office would have violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close ally to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president again three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 helical ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensland crossings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of the whole deck is placed in their place and the last section of the deck is now getting a gong for the deck in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager at the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure is a significant milestone for each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the closure is future-oriented high-end and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the expanding north tower deck, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or the west side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, as the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate because the tolerances that the team worked on were tiny - they were just a few millimeters on each side.</seg>

<seg id="5">But war is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far there is no provision.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "s & D Group president Christoph Bratmann says:" "" "" "" "we are united with the Greens:" "" "" "" "whoever wants to build on urban areas must pay 20 percent of all flats as social housing." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "" "" "the problem, as viola:" "" "" "" "there is currently no agreement between the fractions." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants investors to make as few prescriptions as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher constraints for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">No matter how viola, there is an escalation of the situation in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program does not yet fully stand: for the roughly 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you reconcile the loss of further around 1300 affordable apartments, whose funding will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, according to the political spokesperson Nicole Palm, now-running bindings should be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be rethought to bring apartments back into the price fixing.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the West city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in Weststadt, deadlines are expected to rise at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back into the price fixing for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the West city is drastically increased, the aim of the so-called mixing is removed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children don't go out to play anymore, but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens, has been lamed by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and recently limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July something.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overburdened the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than inks and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokemon, which are followed by a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (using a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured" can be captured.</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the tram and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the "average" person restores every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, who followed 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of subsequent people exercising 30 minutes each day, increased from 45 percent to 53 percent each day.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it merely sees the raw data for the increase in performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to take "30 minutes of time," "coming from the sofa" and "active every day" met deaf ears because many public messages about health are boring and coming from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports are reducing their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even include new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are grumptive gamblers who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could go against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to be?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit have already been able to track our activity earlier, they have no reason to do sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will decrease with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all that.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortlessly on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Stunningly on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant. brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally also Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast cleared the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medalists and "Final Five" team mates Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American woman Simone Biles turnt on the balance beam during the individual multi-year campaign of women in gymnastics at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who gains a multi-battle title, and in total the fifth, while she reinforces her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated her sport and won 15 medals, including 10 gold medals, including 10 gold medals, which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She was expecting a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Do not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after having won Gold and Silver at the Women's Retail Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark on the farewell party of the team coordinator, Martha Karolyi, who retired.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey, it is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Some of her floor exercises, including their typical Tumbling Pass, are attuned to Latin American music, which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium, in which Boorman exercised her, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has not lost any competition competition, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafina was slightly led by two turns, the picture was murky.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish bars and ground tracks - in which Biles holds the world title - lurned.</seg>
<seg id="28">She resumed again with 15,433 on the balance beam - and sat on top with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently when she expected her end - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago, when it fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her exercise she knocked down the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the fast broadening Tweet of the 19-year-olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl shot dead in one of Phoenix's deadliest attacks in the first mass murderous attack of Phoenix, while they stopped in the car and listened to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th while the car was parked in an entry, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a firearm while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police informed that the threefold murder does not seem to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 who owned one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard denounced the shooting of the investigators to take a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Altogether, seven people were killed in nine attacks in Hispanic living quarters within four months and two others were injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," told Howard der KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is assumed that the suspects used several vehicles, including a brown Nissant from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigators refused to reveal the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators found cartridge shells and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments out of the engine compartment.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large-area flooding after extreme rainfalls, the National Weather Service reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the way to the affected communities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, announced that the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that only the commune of Tangipahoa would have requested ten thousand sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used over wide areas in the south of Louisiana to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inches could drop in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the south of Alabama a flood warning system was deployed on Friday, while Mobile continued to rain in the Mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, which are both located in Louisiana, will probably reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas.</seg>
<seg id="13">The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams were still sending people out of flood in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the south-west of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were rescued near Gloster on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, greatly increases overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another stepson who lives near him would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we woke up and the water floated and flocked in," "" "" "" "said Hansford." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife said Hansford had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years where she lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one to swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed up to Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann said that the flood had spread rapidly, as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities would consider evacuation instructions.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone walked from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the soil was considerably outweighed by the rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that heavy rainfall and flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and lesson in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that there were 200 neighbouring houses in Tangipahoa.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, now flooding them both.</seg>
<seg id="29">The leader of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets which were rinsed from floods.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the towns of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuees.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "once the water starts to go back, they will be able to return to their homes," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In the town of Hammond of the commune of Tangipahoa, almost two dozens of roads were closed because of the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents to take part, who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the last major flooding we had was in March," "" "" "" "Lacy Landrum said about the city administration." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="36">According to his data, a handful of houses were reported to be reported as flooding on Thursday, but no reports have been reported on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, manager of Shopper's Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the Turns and this for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I joined every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US was never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this crew, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is a catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the past four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-Americans.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise winner of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the threefold world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterly Gymask routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won Gold in an individual competition for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this kind of sport, but so sports classes in the whole country do not look like this.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all hit the same way as Aly and Madison to get into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympic team will have only four teams in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and Turner primarily comes into private sports clubs that are maintained by parents responsible for training, education, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these Turnvereins are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">The gymnasts receive their entire training in these clubs and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started doing gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to explore the churches out of countless young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to make a more affordable and easy accessible gymnastics training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my sports foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we have offered free and affordable Turns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnasts that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this fantastic Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true representation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team golds and thanking you so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistance specialists who voted in favor rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt had revealed plans to forcibly introduce the contract and said that the NHS would find itself in a "No Man's Land" and any further delay to the employees and patients would be harmful.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistance specialists are supposed to receive a new contract, which includes changes to nocturnal and weekend supplements to improve care at unfavourable times.</seg>

<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time is running out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes stemmed from the government for reluctance to participate, and sometimes on ear-numbing silence.</seg>

<seg id="7">About 140,000 people have a heart attack each year and one quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls which form plaque.</seg>

<seg id="11">Persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name of Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft of NICE, published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlet Luton Rahman was removed from office last year for the release of a government report</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political rectness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally accuses the police, election observers and town councils to have ignored proof of election abuse on account of "oversensitivity regarding ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an antcorruptionist, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set shut-off tapes outside of electoral boxes in order to protect intimidated voters.</seg>

<seg id="13">Last year, a special electoral commission decided that the incumbent mayor of Luton Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical manner" and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious obligation of Muslims to choose him."</seg>

<seg id="20">In his report it says: "as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, especially women and young people, in order to vote according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with a Pakistan or Bangladeshi background.</seg>

<seg id="8">The Chinese swimmers in Ai Muhhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming staffel 1: 57,79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which made it possible for Canadians to close the gap to China.</seg>

<seg id="7">Strike it with the knee in the lath and twist while the attacker binds with pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while they judge the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the weapon and twist it, so that the aggressor cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon on it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright shuts his tongue to the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller submits his immune system and throttle of a serious test by levering some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk fired his course on a euro note, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a sink of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the immunity of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before finishing each object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of decking the rinsing button of a towing toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey across Europe Mr. Wright talked to doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he leaked, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test his bowel's resistance by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings at stations to flushing knobs of toilets, the task has definitely placed his immune system under a test</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was definitely satisfied with his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test sample showed a luminous number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminance number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet to refuse to defile after its luminance number was over 4000 units whereas freshly washed hands show less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacterial counts in different places such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "in the film he says:" "" "" "" "that is the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't lick anything here because it's disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company is equipping Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers something new. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that concluded that we said" "" "" "" "Give us Ian calls." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I lost my respect for Ian, if he would have liked to lick some of the things I ordered him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to put Ian to lick her and others where it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents were associated with lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their home after a delogition with a damage in the amount of £50,000, because it had terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">When they were forcibly removed from their property, the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls showed piercing holes, wooden boards were torn, rubbish was spread on the floor and graffiti was smeared onto the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the management of Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I believe people don't have to live in this way." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is believed to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added, street fights with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, disputes and curses included.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skelby, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old garbage was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were used in the past, the wooden floorboards were torn up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly invoked the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing designed her and her partner by force of the estate this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>

<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that they are finally gone, it will be nice.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it would have had the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the community room garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the tenant has agreed to accept any responsibility for her behavior and family, as delogization is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be horrible for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and gave us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I hope this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A filthy mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogization on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the property management will now have to abandon garbage mountains, which surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and took over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skelby received a fine after she pleaded guilty to the owner of a class B drug in commercial intent.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="37">After being homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the house walls were covered with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police says they will delve tenants who do not stick to house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">The police of Devon and Cornwall informed Angela Crow that the delogization was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproach as well as to those who were harmed by such behavior," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="6">A Kenyan officials informed that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-metre-runner Ferguson Red.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the Kenyan team leader by doping inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF association has requested the IOC for information about the case in order to exert its own investigation, distributed an IAAF spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="9">"depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," said it in an IAAF explanation.</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and spent himself as Ferguson Red, rehearsed and signed," explained Kenya's chief de mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for training controls of the world anti-doping agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Roti was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days before, the Kenyan team leader Michael Roti was withdrawn from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed about pending doping tests against cash payments athlete of his country.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was reported to have been arrested at the Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya has been under special supervision at the IOC after numerous doping contracts.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls submitted by the IOC in front of the Rio Games, it was unusual to note that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">Before the summer games in Brazil, the world anti-doping agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law passed a few weeks before the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, WADA Kenya took part in the list of countries whose doping control is conform with WADA rules.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is considered a great runner-nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of TV reports of the ARD, accusations were raised over and over again that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sports betrugs.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had hired them in the field of Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">In doing so, it was possible to prove that this sport was area-covering and systematically decreased.</seg>
<seg id="26">Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games.</seg>

<seg id="1">Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli</seg>
<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare-year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair, similar to Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="3">A surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Mary as a youth room.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Philharmonic under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he warms.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers with nostalgia her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">Firstly, because it is musically extraordinary!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "she says in her song:" "" "" "" "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and bright and bright." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">It is therefore clever, of course also naïve, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is very similar to me, my Italian character I have as Roman," "" "" "" "laughs Bartoli." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honour to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is a tremendously generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "and Bartoli returns the compliment:" "" "" "" "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with it.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" up to date: "in this piece it's about prejudice and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, at that time the Puppans went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn't want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are the same topics and they are just as significant today as at that time.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia shouldn't vote for the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the state election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For stupid as up to now it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and agricultural class struggle - that is all.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the natives, who are to be convinced by the polls, are on holiday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers travelling in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not local residents, so they are not allowed to choose the land tag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count out votes at the end, only troublesome.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern needs to pass an election campaign almost by the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive electoral campaign." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and chatting a little with the people, just as his legendary wordsmith Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, seafaring has got cold feet and gives chancellor Merkel the blame on the blossoming of AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her refugee policy, her "We create this," accelerates the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its peak channel data, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is to make electoral campaigns at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel's German election circle is located in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other states," Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the north-east CDU largely eliminates the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "that, says Kokert, plays only a" subordinate role "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the Union has noticed that you roar the ground on the ground so that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any in the expanses of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The advice of the CDU-voter Kokert to his fellow campaigners is also self-revealing: "they must go where it hurts, namely where people are: bridefists, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were lagging behind partner CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD won still clearly at 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Green Party, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into the country's day." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "online Electoral Campaign" "" "" "", "calls the president Claudia Müller." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green electoral fighters are going on search for domestic stimulants among the holidaymakers.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about on the speed with which the B27 will be rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 in the morning and end until around 20 o'clock, there are all-inclusive commendations.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they did everything pretty hard," "" "" "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the reciprocity of those responsible for the construction works is also commended, for example when it comes to furnishing public transport." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and the block of asphalt road in Ofterdingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg was restored, the traffic situation within the village was relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from the B 27 from Ofterdingen on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive movement through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there have been considerable complaints," says the deputy chief executive officer Florian King responsible for the management of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many crews were looking for and more familiar with their navigation than the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the failure of a number of trucks in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality exacerbated the Mössingen ground vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there were considerable excesses," "" "" "" "says King, who himself informed himself about the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been inflamed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was on the way with 77 kilometers per hour in the speed 30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to revenue breaks at them makes everybody who asks you to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customer" are produced for other companies, for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the car dealership, Thomas Sulz also talks about a "at most slight drop," but also admits that obviously "the record is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily mined are the bars along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "not only did it, but all the restaurants" "" "" "" "hit hard" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "the sales revenue figures on" "" "" "" "far more than 50 percent" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "street structuring took its operation" "" "" "" "thrown back two years" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to release half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt asserted on a request from Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the suggestion that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location at the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where so much more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family business has been here since 1715, it refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular guests are now less frequently visited because of the complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it is also elsewhere beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">The fact that his family-list comes back to the end of the renovation works, Göhner has no doubt.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction on his customers for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-term history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, that's brutal.</seg>

<seg id="22">In the case of toleration for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse, such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disguise their identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">But Volkswagen gets off lightly.</seg>
<seg id="2">Despite diesel scandals, delivery rates are rising worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">But it does not run smoothly in all markets.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there is a term in the recall campaign." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen starts the second half of the year when it comes to delivery.</seg>
<seg id="6">Despite its many brands and some well-running markets, Europe's largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus despite its many brands and some well-running markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in July, VW's core brand slowed above all in Western Europe and thus again stressed the total sale of the Dax-listed company.</seg>
<seg id="8">In July, the VW brand sold 449100 cars to 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sales alone in Western Europe, the second most important market in China, were 14 percent below the previous year's level.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market of Germany, deliveries declined by almost one sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sales of marketing Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July especially to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>

<seg id="13">In addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote also burdened the exit from the EU, explained a spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA, where the exhaust-gas-type first escalated, a minus is also available.</seg>
<seg id="15">Big support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">Overall, the mainly affected family brand of the Lower Saxony got off lightly by the diesel scandal. after the first seven months, only an extradition of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales director Fred Kappler was able to further develop a sales division from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated a software emission test.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million vehicles to convert into workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of the conversion VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After conversion of vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.</seg>
<seg id="23">After retrofitting, the car manufacturer grants the customer a "guarantee rental" certificate but does not speak of a "guarantee" as it was said on Friday in business circles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The reason is legal subtleties.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "Focus" "" "" "" "had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Ministry of Transport has confirmed that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "VW has fully met the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "deviations from this are not accepted," "" "" "" "explained Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has assumed the guarantee that no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after retrofitting has not taken place and all type-approved vehicle values remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "Volkswagen itself uses the term" "" "" "" "guarantee" "" "" "" "but not as it was called in corporate circles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "guarantee," Volkswagen is able to see that for example, half a year after retrofitting, customers can get into a workshop for example half a year after conversion, and this could result in the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the case of customer interest, it is important to avoid that there is uncertainty about possible warranty regulations in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the gas scandal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Sheets: who actually buys Schallplatten?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you make a part of the comment section in order to see him under the pseudonym Non-Allee Men's Middle Age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the frequently discussed resurgence of records is not attributable to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record sellers tend to retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But vote the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while walking in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and gracefully cuddling before I stop, hold my hands and say something different: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although the heart of Soho slowly stands in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling up the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to whom I am from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle aged men) in Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men of middle aged, a woman, probably around the 20th), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 slabs.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), put out the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford, when they appeared and again to buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, when I was 11 or 12. things I thought I was a little too young to buy them," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my truck.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets may apply to YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media track, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "customers who once sold their records to buy their CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record shops offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers accepted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, objects that call for happy reminiscences.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "" "" "says WEZ." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">That's as a collector so and I think it's like that for many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally occupy yourself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "" "" "a staff flutes from a pile of plates." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have record players whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while browsing through a pile of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three men of middle aged), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just recently came in and said," I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-friendly, less music-like.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "we have people who say:" "" "" "" "I don't have record players." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the vinyl records almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts offers latest synthesizer and sextant pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks odd but nailing psychic traumas are hard to find when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a window-bumper than a big shopping experience.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so collecting sheets is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "it casts off with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I'm pretending to wear jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who gather for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "it is pure" "" "" "" "record art" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as boards.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research showed that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectibles that exist in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning with the bumblebees on Berwick Street and the leaves by panels, while they avoid the starring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old, false moderator who rises above the shoulders of anything of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais claimed that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops where people within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture also argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy where no taxes would be paid and that would pose a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary shops, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the collapse was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the camp, which is commonly operated and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum facts for the hundreds of needy, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids' café.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racer has to adapt to the next generation of speed sensors: in different federal states, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flashguns are being tested which are to be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic-looking reinforcement Trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident spots where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days for continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded at the same time across multiple tracks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as access bans to time, strip and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the high-propelled condition, the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hitch according to the manufacturer.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium.</seg>

<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji could have beaten a 15-man team in its best form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one brite tomorrow will have a gold medal on his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>

<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by a fight with the trainer's cancer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinale gold than with these games and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard sieves that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">The echo of the coach Robin Williams was present when she rowed for the second Olympic runner in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports, who made such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, at least her 39.ter undefeated bet, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athletes, who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who make up the incremental progress that makes the difference, and no one was more useful than the coach, who didn't know if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, in case that under such circumstances is the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve-stricken morning talking somewhat more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning who was a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeats how much that means how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you goes to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person to train or better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race over the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop, Stanning and Glover had too much reserve in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV explorer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>

<seg id="10">The water supply association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, annually promotes about 150,000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member municipalities are Kirchner, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunah.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water delivery contracts for other towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current Chairman, Breitbrunner's mayor in Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed a Water Stewart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work to office and organization activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency assignments on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land purchase in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of the farmers, the refurbishment of the elevated tanks (1999), the acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the redistribution of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was no standstill and new additions were added because water is the main food and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service for more than 31 years.</seg>

<seg id="22">He is the best watertank and he was a faithful scarf.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a highlight from his point of view, he described the well-construction and the restructuring of the kennel association.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-shaken and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the sector from green electricity support are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the release of the Renewable Energies Survey at the existing systems for so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday issue).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption, to the cash desk.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry has threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>

<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe is suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to intensify when the world's largest producer in China threw masses of steel onto the world market in the face of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel corporations price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel show effect, and on the other hand the economic prospects in China have risen.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>

<seg id="28">In July, German steel manufacturers are cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, as the Steel Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the quantity produced went back to the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Production has been around two percent lower than the previous year's figure since the beginning of the year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in teacher education she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing is moving me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and altogether more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior Championships.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, senior citizens can socialize and nurture social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak and organize, to be able to leave and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this reason, senior citizens train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs are not as fast out of the powder in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for older people, Singing often has a very special effect," "" "" "" "says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour community of senior citizens" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through song lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia relive themselves on long back events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, a special performance is demanded from the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Concentrate on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for something for a long time, I will get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing men, who can hear if there's a sound coming next?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer, senior citizens have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings of the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, you can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="5">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "doping is still the headlines of the Rio Olympics." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The Russian swimmers Julija Jefimowa, who had plagued her starting right before the games after a doping lock, kicked off and buoed mercilessly at her start (100 meters of chest).</seg>
<seg id="7">There was a whimsical scene: with an awkward smile she was still standing in the hall and provoked her appearance.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it was clear that she was not going to collect gold, the audience broke out into a rush-storm.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are many more athletes who start the Olympic Games in Rio despite the doping past.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here's an overview:</seg>
<seg id="11">Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-relay): the 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was already locked two times for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).</seg>
<seg id="13">Since its spell, the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex-World Champion travelled even faster than before, he is the number one in the world in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m from Staffel / Jamaika): the two-time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to leave a six-month lockout after taking the pain medication Oxycodon.</seg>
<seg id="15">She had severe toothache after an operation, and the 29-year-old defended her.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sandra Perkovic (Diskus / Croatia): in 2011, the Olympic champion of 2012, World Champion of 2013 and European Champion, was tested positively on the forbidden stimulant methyl hexanamin from 2010 to 2016.</seg>
<seg id="17">Perkovic denied the indemnity and was locked for six months.</seg>
<seg id="18">The four widest throws this year go to the account of the big gold favorite.</seg>
<seg id="19">LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Staffel / USA): the Beijing Olympic champion and two-time World Champion over 400 m, was positively tested in 2010 and had been closed for 21 months.</seg>
<seg id="20">A means of penis enlargement was responsible, bettered Merritt.</seg>
<seg id="21">This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ivan Tichon (hammer throw, Belarus): probably hardly an athlete has been recognized as many medals afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="23">Tichon lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone-doping.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2004, the 40-year-old also had to bid for steroid doping and the EM title in 2006 for testosterone abuse.</seg>
<seg id="25">He also received the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games because of a judgment of the International Criminal Court CAS.</seg>
<seg id="26">At 80.04 m he is ranked second in the world ranking list.</seg>
<seg id="27">Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): the world record holder and gold favourite was tested positive only in May but may nevertheless start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the 29-year-old world champion indications have been found for taking a banned food supplement, the lock of the world anti-doping agency WADA was mild and ran already on July 13th.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bomballing terror in Thailand - injured - Several deaths</seg>
<seg id="2">The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">She suffered from cuts and had been treated in hospital but I have already left it.</seg>
<seg id="4">She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is still unclear whether the further explosions on the holiday island Phuket as well as in the southern cities Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this respect, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities, so Schnöll.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Hua Hin, located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok, was first exploded on Thursday evening in a Nightlife two bombs.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian woman, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning another two explosives went high, another human being killed, according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">The detonation near the Patong beach, which was popular with tourists, was injured by taxi drivers.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-eastern coast of the country another bomb exploded, killing an urban worker.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive charge went into the air in a flower bed in front of the precinct of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwestern coast and in Chumphon on the south-eastern coast demanded several wounded.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, that was called.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bombings bear the same handwriting," said army general Danai Kritethavee Friday morning ahead of journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we assume that it is a coordinated attack." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express oneself on possible motives - but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern that is typical for the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist revolt movement or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "" "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is rather assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities had kept secret information about upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they would not have been informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police advised their officials throughout the country to reinforce security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are still small bombings, but most of the time they are not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin there is a palace used for years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">Following the well-known bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs insists on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High safety risk (level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no necessary travel in these provinces." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this gives the military great influence over the coming years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos, while the country moves toward stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, benefits itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack on the country's younger history.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or World Records do not always determine the headlines of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center, the slightly superior swimmers from Ethiopia floated so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was chosen.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte became an Internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his first course with a 48-second return and occupied the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24 year old still participates in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in sub-represented countries more known.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since most sportsmen run in orthopaedics, Habte wanted to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>

<seg id="15">"" "" "" "some media referred to it as" "" "" "" "robel of the whale" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">The English tabloid "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he only struck with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played no role there.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">The run of Eric Moussambani took care of media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmers from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to play alone in a run over 100 meters of freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was frenetic at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim before the Olympics for eight months and had never had such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">As of October 1, 2016, the fees per cubic metre of waste water amount to 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultemberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will rise again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a heavy calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the budget by the District Office of Kulmbach was determined that undercover for these sewage treatment plants expired.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasbah market is obliged to operate the plants cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fees are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Head of Administration Herbert Schmidt explained to the board, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period between October 2016 and September 2020, over- and undercover from the previous calculation period can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained the serious fee increases for relatively small installations with a very low waste water supply, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, due to the small distribution basis, expenditure for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would be grave.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the recumbent calculation period for all three plants, not least due to their age renovation and repair expenses were incurred in a considerable extent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for the world, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the sewage plant Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">After nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage plant had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the low waste water supply in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were "fully struck."</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs in the waste water systems in the past 20 years, has been spared.</seg>
<seg id="21">In view of stone houses, the situation for the above-mentioned plants will continue to remain precarious in the long run, especially since the supply area of the sewage disposal association Friesenbachtal cannot be extended by these facilities because it is a deficit.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "" "" "Snapchat" "" "" "" "Anime" "" "" "" "-effect is criticized as Asian caricature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are non-bloated, self-propelled tools that produce more than 30 million better selfies a day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All abnormalities get to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have gone critique in the past where they were accused of propagating the application blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week a few users suggested a filter which gave them slit eyes, false teeth and dark cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature from Asians - "yellowish face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat shared that it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was meant as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders, who experienced racism, reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anion comparision.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos became widespread, that the filter "hurting and mildly said uncomfortable."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very reluctant Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not gel-proof, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the degrading extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride of pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - those in terms of race diverser than their older counterpart - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats Filtern creates a picture that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things stay unnoticed than it was earlier," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for media and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that rapid-based controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu also criticized the mostly white male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either she has no representation of people with other skin colors in her staff, so she can make such decisions," said the Chinesich-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that the Snapchat largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, the Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a speaker, the company recently hired a personnel manager focusing on sub-represented population groups and internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu, on the other hand, said that she will have their Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information, states committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command modified intelligence service to draw up an optimistic view of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground, a committee of inquiry made its report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Preliminary Report, created by a Task Force of Republican Members of the Army Committees, Secret Service Committees, and the Army Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, just cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "intelligence information posted by high-level Centcom Commandees regularly marked a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "" "" "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the formation of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government spikes under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts watched the pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than facts," the report stated.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossi could start in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after months of investigations, it is clear." "" "" "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans launched the task force after they were admitted that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed insights as the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of Centcom reports are underway through the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively restricted trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," announced the highest level democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this process," "" "" "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "" "" "delayed publication of intelligence reports," "" "" "" "said the morals under analysts and" gave too little room for divergent opinions. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats gave no reference to a White House intervention at the Centcom analyst regarding a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the investigation were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation into the Pentagon's General Inspector, who were accepted after complaints by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the reports of the Congress, while the investigation of the General Inspector was still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "but he also stated that" "" "" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by an American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">The allegations of last year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the disputes of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush envisaged only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in revolting against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker states that contrary to the statements by the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damer commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for its excessively positive appraisal of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">A day after they scored three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games were supposed to represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am not one of the people who keep their doors in mind." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">But she knows that: the American women lie at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons in the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remain unbeaten.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-placed one will take a little longer from the strong Dutch, leading the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game on Saturday like, the American women have triggered a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 seats.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey player in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became National player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, as she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things better.</seg>

<seg id="18">We have been able to pull the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the doors in the first half of the game with a back-hand handshake.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was without any victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and knocked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 guidance.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the US goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling constant and inevitable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is passed from the crossbow to the swimmers to the gymnast to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's chat on the queue in the coffee shop, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympics and a swarm of women with dimples, could well have been among those known names being sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not highlight any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I can modestly make arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although trampolines have been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it was perceived so sparingly that many people I had questioned did not know that it is even an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had had an athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline has some outsider, partly because it is suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown primary school, which sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending burst - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "Trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means so much like "stepping stone."</seg>
<seg id="22">Rising winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a series of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to version, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medal winners have to go farther in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes down and back, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also in television broadcast another jeopardy goal: that of the world or the Olympic record.</seg>
<seg id="28">The target-oriented striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel as something tiring even when looking at these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes upwards, then down, then effortlessly upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of women will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final round as part of a afternoon block from 14.00 on both days.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner proposed recently - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley is expecting his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>

<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was relentless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that police fired and killed demonstrators on a number of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is cherished by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or sent to prison, killed or driven into the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if you oppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "" "" "said Señol Teshome, a teacher in Ethiopia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line begged hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, can exploit and rearm the turbulence.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why, after years of biting, feelings of bitterness explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians were able to communicate through the social media, because cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they gathered so too protesters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia to predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economics, while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and living in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are coordinating under a screen," "" "" "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromos areas.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray who account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, has been prime minister until his death in 2012 at an unpublicized disease in Ethiopia for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was particularly well versed in seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "" "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively intransparent grounds to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of polls protested, that according to analysts apparently slipped by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the raids that followed, many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest was relatively quickly over.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train as well as their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal disapproval of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, Protests in Gondar, an americ city, managed by Tigray, and hatred toward the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring US and other western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The US government used Ethiopia as the basis for emergency flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While Westerners clearly want to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by saying that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been serious about the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidates whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings its fellow combatants who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of declaring statements he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the interpretation of an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump resigned in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation perfectly.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help mitigate his statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism hit Mr. Trump as he tried to steer the focus of his campaign for falling survey data on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he had a strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Of course, I thought that sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then row back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans how they arrive, and then if necessary" clarify "depending on how the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>

<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Turkey's most prominent critics, struggled to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that in front of Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organisation, he called it backsists, perfectly wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream publicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton acted as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread out of the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being frighted on each of his words and to be biased against him.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a bigamy café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which didn't have Wi-Fi, but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices of his Bedford Avenue store front were supplanted.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie's business, which was sold in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local inhabitants claimed it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is exempted and Verb is now a soap shop."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, then it's also re-discovery.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new club has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing staff of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outside office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old club.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said that he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnings like capers and sautéed onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "many old customers were also supplanted by prices from Williamsburg," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>

<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even though she ordered a Blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been a long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before work and invariably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I came to seven, every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything bagel with butter," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he did not hassle that the soap shop occupied the old business area.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of the soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb with the cold-brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think we will still address their offer," "" "" "" "said Rodriguez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish inhabitants Greenpoints have also accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he pretended to leave it soon, so that his new neighbors will feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold brewed coffee into the bottle.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café is expanding into an adjacent building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers a new club is sufficient to get their old favorites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a homecoming.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-hairs usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland's hair is only 150 years old.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches just 1.220 meters in average.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-meter-long animal accelerates on a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">But this slowness lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate by a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "madness," "" "" "" "says Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographical research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolutionary biologist believed for a long time that Greenland's hair would be stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-hairs are hard to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures of around 6 degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her slow-motion picture shows her how to equip six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Perhaps they hunt down sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadavers, that torches down from higher water-layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland shark, the fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the biggest 502 centimetre was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, the carbon-14 method analysed the lens nucleus of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eyelids appears before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had remarkably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s when nuclear weapons attempts to produce larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">With a length of 220 centimeters of the third smallest animal, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small excess of carbon-14 out of nuclear weapons attempts, it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, all major Greenland shark had normal carbon-14 volumes in their lens nucleus, which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimetre-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, whereas the record shark with 502 centimetres was likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now researchers of the length were able to assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined by 156 years, Greenland-hair with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries-time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methane alemes live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120 year old harpoon point, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on asparagus flames.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal influences warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," "" "" "" "says the evolutionary biologist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should, on the other hand, invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hillary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015, which resulted in the presidency candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2015, the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5,3 million in free speech.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clinton's candidate for vice-president, Senator Tim Imperial from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton released his tax declarations during the last ten years.</seg>
<seg id="5">They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Hillary Clinton and Tim Imperial continue to set standards regarding financial transparency," said Clinton's Campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a stark contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and recomers regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declarations.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not obligated to do so by law.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.</seg>
<seg id="10">"you're on the train," wrote Clinton's election campaign assistant Ian Sams on Twitter, with regards to the publication of the democrats "presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Thursday Michael Cohen, Trump Special Advisor, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax audits did not finish.</seg>
<seg id="12">Turkey's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already voiced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets, his donations for charitable organisations, his business forums and various other links, especially with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Clinton has already overthrown the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday, prompting high-ranking Republican Trump to release his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Thursday, she addressed the subject also during a speech on the economy in Michigan.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax declarations." "" "" "" "she said to the crowd." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Politico announced that during the 1990s, Trump paid no or very little taxes, and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday that could still be the case." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor warts buffett who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30%.</seg>
<seg id="19">President Obama also supports the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="20">During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton in the past week in Omaha, Nebraska called for buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate here has its seat, Trump invited to a meeting to exchange their tax declarations.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Buffett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit of the IRS and Trump had" "" "" "" "fear" "" "" "" "before the voters and not before tax authorities." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Clinton's campaign has posted tax returns back to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Clinton's now living in Chappaqua, New York, averaged an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.</seg>
<seg id="24">The fiscal policy of the 2015 clintons showed that these only USD 100 of their income as a reward, unlike most Americans.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their main investment was a cost-effective index fund from which the Clinton's dividends and earnings were taxed $109,000.</seg>

<seg id="2">Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from walking in inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipuy.</seg>
<seg id="3">The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, who had the idea for years ago, has intensified its promotion along with U.S. nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without injuring animals.</seg>

<seg id="5">Different pilgrimage destinations have been examined and one finally decided to visit the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where a special pilgrim's goal was offered during the Holy Year of Mercy with the opened portal of mercy at the Freiburg cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and Heiligenkel, were on the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Pastor Raymond sent the pilgrims at a small ceremony in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrimage and granted the Pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">Von Horb was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster Unserer loved a woman standing on the pilgrimage route from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening, each with a short impulse with different prayers, songs and written lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedely made a rest for singing together a song from a specially composed pilgrim's booklet.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the nights, parishioners of the local parishes were available.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller ensured a tasty and starchy dinner and breakfast.</seg>

<seg id="15">The earned reward was a common barbecue at the bathing pond in the evening.</seg>

<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots, which has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - who won Hoy four years ago - and Skinner won an Olympic team in the qualification round, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was close behind after his lap, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear in order to slow down and make it Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>

<seg id="1">More than just a Kardashian Reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue</seg>
<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashyan-Jenner clan, Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "" "" "wrote Kendall." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), scanned reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn) as well as in the presence of the universally popular Showbiz-Uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest).</seg>
<seg id="6">This is the cliché act almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 am), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kim's big sister Kim doesn't like what the Vogue cover is concerned (they and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a volume resembling a picture book rather than a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were advertising by the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years, images of the magazine still seep before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "in recent years there have been clearly more" celebrities who model "" "" "" "" models, celebrities "" "" "" "" on the cover. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar Award Winner and brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover for 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls below the former category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even though everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners doesn't like success to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With its reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world has always been something tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret-Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the mistletins of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings recoil again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But riding around on the displeasure seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">She makes advertising for your priming of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her made pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>

<seg id="7">Farrell said that without a suspension of the decision of the federal government, the situation would only get worse.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Queensland's community centers are chronically underfinanced, meaning that thousands of people from key services you need are rejected," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">People who rely on violent relations, people with unmanageable and oppressive debts, families who have been divorced by separations, workers who have been divorced wrongly - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot obtain the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of June 2017, the federal government will cut the funding by 30 percent, which means that thousands of needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance.</seg>
<seg id="11">We urge the General Prosecutor and Federal Justice Minister and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to immediately raise these shortcuts so that people can get the help they need in legal issues.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (September 4) and Berlin (September 18), considerable losses are recorded for the government parties of the SPD and the CDU.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator appeared on the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors are dominating the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tool weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good at hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite clunky.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was eight megabytes at the beginning, that would be enough today for about two selfies of high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000communicator" arrived exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, in the shops - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros fans can still buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the InterNet Age.</seg>
<seg id="11">Twenty years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in the west pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for the standards at that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to web pages was possible by using HTML browsers, albeit slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be opened similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proudly the price was: 2700 D-Mark, about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>

<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Finns" "" "" "" "mobile phone" "" "" "" "experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold to Microsoft." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, vendors are dominating the market, all of which came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Being online always and everywhere today is for a lot of people's everyday lives.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users around the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">About 1.4 billion units were sold, Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">This includes the well-running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the meantime, an entire industry has emerged around the smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007, at that time, Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac World announced the introduction of the iPhone.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an Internet communications, all by touch screen easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Apple triumphal procession began, even today, the iPhone is the Group's most important product.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="35">They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies that earn money with online advertising, one of the software manufacturers attempts to circumvent ad blocking, a "cat and mouse game."</seg>

<seg id="2">According to projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably habitable once.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to detect the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine if Venus could have rejected such conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still revolved slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably posted more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected against rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a Sun which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exhibits its day-to-day side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model created a history of Venus similar to evolution that was previously thought by planet scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was once habitable, Venus -- in the course of several billions years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was fired from the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their Hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the Pleiades</seg>
<seg id="2">The latest mission with Kepler World Space Telescope helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars are rotating in the star cluster to different rates, as well as in what context the rotational periods are related to planet formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star companies, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated some 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the quickest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak-rotation rates, these poisonous stars repel large quantities of star winds.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is aging, its rotation-rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotational rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The newest catalogue of rotation advice indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the star cluster of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">We would like to learn more about how, when and why stars can slow down their rates of rotation and hang up their "dance shoes" so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the growth rates of the Pleiades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="2">Alex Rodriguez's tears ran faster than the US baseball star in the best days of Base to Base.</seg>
<seg id="3">After his emotional withdrawal, the 41 year-old pro will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12th against the Tampa Bay Rays.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I say goodbye to Goodbye," explained the 14-times all-star game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).</seg>
<seg id="6">Three times Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.</seg>
<seg id="7">His signature under a ten-year contract gave him $27 million a year since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will serve as a consultant and a youth coach - at full salary.</seg>
<seg id="9">As a player Rodriguez paid his money back for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="10">With 696 Homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he has made some milestones.</seg>
<seg id="11">With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players show similar values in the most important statistics.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the 41-year-old is not likely to be accepted into the rest hall of the baseball.</seg>
<seg id="13">For so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.</seg>
<seg id="14">Already in 2009 the superstar admitted to "ESPN" between 2001 and 2003 that steroids were forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="15">In August 2013, he was closed for 211 games due to an involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rodriguez is considered the prime suspect to have received performance-enhancing remedies for years via an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.</seg>
<seg id="17">After a lawsuit, the barrier was reduced to 162 meetings.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the league could have done me a favour in 2014 because I played 20 years without a break," "" "" "" "Rodriguez said at the time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">His farewell days are not silent as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">While many baseball legends occupy the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my job does not include goodbye tour." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"my job involves trying to win any game," said Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.</seg>
<seg id="23">After all Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and the relations with Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, was given sympathy for the fans of the Yankee archrival Boston Red Sox.</seg>
<seg id="24">"we want A-Rod," the fans sang at 4: 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland can't start in Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A wiped athlete would have won almost one medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese swimmers in Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle-runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the athletics competitions that were critically accepted, these news came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last Sunday, Chen demonstrated the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a mask-absorbing agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Criminal Court (CAS) confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old gave the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly, just 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have participated in the runs over 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B-sample and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations," said Xinhua from a message: "we will cooperate with the International Criminal Court CAS and will accept the judgment."</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history the IOC, but the CAS, is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news filtered through Danekova's positive test, while the 33-year-old went on the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "" "" "an incredible shock," "" "" "" "she said to the Bulgarian TV channel BNT." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substance is supposed to act as a blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B specimen should also have a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately expressed his criticism of the Bulletin.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions," "" "" "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski," the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, was tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days before.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both of them deny the intake, but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the athletes start, the Danekova case is another heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF world association banned the launch of the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic doping, also the Läufernation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the field of swimming, the previous offences in China also had catastrophic conflicts between athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harsch.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide presses hacker their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Blackmail programmers are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware resistance specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, several times victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 per cent of the companies were already the target of ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40% of the victims readily paid the ransom funds required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize their blackmail software based on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to blackout ransom is significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of malware," "" "" "" "says Malwarebytes leader Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" world. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the Malwarean programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">The aim was not until private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was terrifying rapidly in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users find the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of German companies reported loss of revenue by Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to disrupt their business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we always tell the victims:" "" "" "" "do not pay, you only support the problem," "" "" "" "says Kleczynski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies paying, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure investigated the user interfaces and the contact with the blackmailers and result in the result: the culprits actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They tell their victims via chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt free sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate sometimes hard and pay 5-digit sums to retrieve their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively low-risk income from ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and sharing their work, says Security Expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware roughly within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software module to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The up-to-date malware kits have arisen as the malware itself, counseling, and additional tools have been purchased for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "included is a fitting tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "" "" "says Wisniewski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmaids then look for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">Thus, one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "usually the criminals then commission spammers with spreading," "" "" "" "explains Wisniewski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">Ransomware's risk is now known by many companies that better safeguard their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to ward off Ransomware by means of file backup and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful enforcement, the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "" "" "says Malwarebytes leader Marcin Kleczynski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the potential damage potential, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz, Defcon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="21">The beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed regulator responds to road sign recognition and throttles the speed when required.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is only available for top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI jack are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>

<seg id="2">It stings regularly on the roundabout - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, this should change: the legal subscription shall be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all drivers who are in traffic on the ambient road every night in traffic jams when driving over the motorway to Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">The road construction will extend on Tuesday and Wednesday (16. / 17 August) in the area between the hammer street and the exit Weser Straße the right-turning track by 700 meters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The weather has made the shooting star Guckern in the south-west of Germany a stroke through the bill on Friday - but there is still hope.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one turns around forever, at night one lies awake for hours, in the morning it is far before the wake-up ringing not to think of sleep anymore.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is everything else but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disturbance and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">What are the symptoms of sleep problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, stressed Hans-Günter Weert, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleeping Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">But what one sees below is the insomnia, that is, a disturbance of the insomnia.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just as sleeping, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German general medical association with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Organic, mental, or behavioural factors, but also medicines, can be put behind it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently, sleep disturbance is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "very early awakening is most common in depression," "" "" "" "says Wepex." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors oppress each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can easily wake up, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to think about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep problems become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">If you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day, you should go to the doctor, advise you.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or bodily complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and no more than two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep-medical center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin, emphasizes the low-settled sleeper medics in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, you should first contact the doctor in case of problems with sleeping problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">In order to study in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise for example snoring with respiratory sufferers, in cases of sick weariness, sleepwalkers or if you fail to find the cause of a sleeping disorder, "Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "just please do not make a nap," "" "" "" "says Figans." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After disgusting, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">A camera also records the sleeping end on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screws which can be used for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">It counts on: regular sleep and standing times, don't sleep too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, don't watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and don't watch at the clock at night - then you start to calculate immediately, and that is quite and certainly not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimmers Markus Deizer commented on Facebook for the disappointing cutting of the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he first picked up gold at the shortwave world championships in Doha and at the same time made his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former DSV-athlete Markus Deizer has now protected himself against his ex-team-mates, who are protesting against his criticism.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a country in which an Olympic winner receives 20,000 €premium and a jungle king 150.000 €should no one be surprised by missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="6">The transport system in the swimming pool is bad, the doping controls, on the other hand, are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see or operate so closely on the subject of doping.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I'm not saying that the controls should be stopped here," "" "" "" "he continued." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to make a comeback, Deizer would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Deutschland (NADA).</seg>

<seg id="1">The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like that, but the police numbers them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes at playgrounds, a newly-painted kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone has sprayed on the façade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already built: a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trendy neighborhood," as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will, however, prefer to be billed with burning cars in recent weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented leases, however, on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, since the beginning of the year, the Berlin internal senator Henkel has voted several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22nd, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, the police patrolled out official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three clubteam cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved away from sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents go for a walk, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late i.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, is especially annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the house projects, they share the worry of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who, in majority, wanted police protection from leftists.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin senator and the police between house occupiers and their neighbours open up, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which today, in comparison with the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house occupations and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer street near the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared under a large police charge in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the neighborhood has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and choice headliners all over the world over the past few years. residents of East Germany and former landowners share their neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: they can be recognized by screened windows or newly painted facades, which were discarded with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "no other road was mentioned this year as often as" "" "" "" "left-autonomous violence" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime: crimes like body injuries are almost exclusively directed against police officers.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest part of the offenses put in factual insults, which tend to make new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenant next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">When it comes to violence, it is appealingly: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer any longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For her studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">For this reason, it was also so important for the residents to get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the city's interpretation.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: through faceless newbuildings in former mosquitoes that crowd the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these are ultimately condominiums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well drunk," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I absolutely can't approve of violence and destruction." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if someone never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for drawn-out people who are annoyed by colour-bombs: the skin projects and the left-hand scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who is coming, should be aware of it - just like someone pulls into a tavern district, can complain badly about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the management team for Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact person for all stakeholders: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working group indicates that the honorary officials are more than thankful that Deuschle is here now, the egg-making Wollmilksau, which has above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less mocking - were aiming at the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">An administrative professional with a talent for languages and people was sought, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a homonymous dream of woolen milk.</seg>
<seg id="10">Annika Deuschle says that administrative work is not her central area.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organizing, working with local people and behind the scenes as well as networking.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent point of time limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was high time," "" "" "" "says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers are soon available in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">Municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the communes themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the District Office of the municipality to the municipality and Jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it does not work, so you have to rely on private apartments, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings have to be sobered up as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">New containers are soon to be placed in the waterway.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training centres, school courses, one-euro jobs and helpers for refugees and migrants who need to be undone or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "" "" "says Regine customer." "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master builders, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "this is" "" "" "" "no employment therapy" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and mainly language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So there is also administration and community of honour.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees are feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever gets the feeling that he can't help in Urbach, can't work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "but there are problems also," "" "" "" "people who do nothing at all." "" "" "" "therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "" "" "all this is already a" "" "" "" "mammoth task." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no," "" "" "" "says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "" "" "what some naive might call" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins will call them completely in obituary.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "" "" "says Regine customer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">Thus, main and honorary officials have to look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">In doing so, they always have in the background that soon a new blow to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question must be answered clearly, the policy is heinous.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Urbach we have not yet arrived, where we want to go," "" "" "" "says Annika Deuschle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would ease the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbach are already at full capacity to integrate the previous people rationally.</seg>
