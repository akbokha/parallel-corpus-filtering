Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Teher@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but during the meeting , the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution was discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu of lack of will in the peace process .
the deal struck by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme has worsen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu declared a controversial speech that was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , but a meeting was rejected with reference to the election forthcoming at that time in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor decides to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told us that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone .
inside the house , the officials found the bodies of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note sti@@ ched on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular story professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said Lamb had made the disa@@ strous distress at some point after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took his life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he men@@ tions the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both stayed in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion that Lamb had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to establishing an Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs &apos;s track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car was running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew he knew the people who lived there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb grew up in the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
in spring , he received his doc@@ torate in pedago@@ gi@@ cs .
one of the long @-@ time friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
at that time , he was the flock of women .
all the girls melted when he was there , &quot; H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 , and in the Jackson suburbs of Brand@@ on .
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband von Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but had friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail rose both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for different companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes an enter@@ tain@@ er at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5th September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester program and specialized in American ab@@ orig@@ ines and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening , approximately 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the congregation at a commemor@@ ative cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the watch vi@@ gil , while the Univers@@ itä@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says Lamb opened the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss called Pr@@ enti@@ ss to be his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox talks about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ aw@@ n and a length of Ar@@ ms to be with Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever shot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN boss again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey results that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in surveys , it has not worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom gained only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ h &apos;s Super PAC@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth will now recognize g@@ uts staying power and start dropping their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Turkey &apos;s popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week found that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anger@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent say the same thing about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the Est@@ abl@@ ishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see Tru@@ mp temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temp@@ er for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first pre @-@ election rule of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament did not pass to the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their nests , republi@@ can constitu@@ ents consider Tru@@ mp to be real .
if they are asked who will most likely win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four out of ten of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ ers shri@@ mp campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp still strikes almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to the Tru@@ mp leadership while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp is re@@ aping majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , ahead of J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who hits him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans says they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have set their votes firmly .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
yet Tru@@ mp is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp .
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on the subject of immigration .
since Donald Tru@@ mp had named &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration was a turning point in the public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp crucial His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans will be kept away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues .
so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems to be doing Donald Tru@@ mp as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fru@@ stration over the government is climbing to new levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters is now om@@ itted , above all by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa @-@ Repub@@ lic@@ ans have been frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; angry . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : Germany &apos;s five most exclusive residential areas
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ke@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a roof @-@ roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; stated in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows in which special locations a square meter will cost the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student code in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top places , however , the price is similar to Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro , per square meter , well marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two Tor@@ schüt@@ z in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to Bayern 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have made a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; witch n@@ ett@@ le from Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90 . + 2 ) and i@@ dol hits ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starting success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to get the witch @-@ pot@@ t to Munich .
at his 28th place in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership , Müller received good help from Olympic Games go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who caused a f@@ lange of the World Master to pass .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bavarian captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans before the game at Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich held their word .
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home games in the top class , including well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven European Cup du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they courage@@ ously went to work in their offensive efforts , but often too resour@@ ceful .
the attacks were too often initiated by the shift of game on the left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck on the right , when his flan@@ k came out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the Polish head of the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct debit , the keeper Roberto saved with his knee ( 35 . ) .
even though the Bav@@ arians played their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could bet needle @-@ stick .
but on the go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er he was reli@@ eved .
for instance , when he drew a shot from ide@@ ye over the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola had defended a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cabin , was sitting outside .
the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , &quot; said sports director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
during the first change the Guardian decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later .
before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of terri@@ fied Bavarian fans in their audience block obviously provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with bat@@ ches against the Munich adher@@ ents .
at least one of Bavaria &apos;s fans were injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only damage the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : in case of aband@@ on@@ ment , the risk decreases quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to qu@@ itting smoking , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fa@@ che .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
root causes for dental failure include tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val tissue , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphasize .
the relationship between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years for the endanger@@ ment to return to the level of qu@@ itting smoking , explained the author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health until high age .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years have been affected by lack of tooth@@ lessness , divided the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ mines the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists encounter the remains of the late Anti@@ quity at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the second time .
arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum made skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings close to the site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , &quot; said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments since the construction work began on the Rhine .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Archae@@ ological Heritage Nur@@ sing Care .
in the third section of the Rhin@@ eland @-@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found what they are looking for .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church , a cemetery with some 350 graves has been discovered , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman of freight tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory captured
after a young woman is disp@@ at@@ ched at the train station in Spain , the police asks the local police to help .
on Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 o &apos;clock the woman crossed the railway station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
by recording the train , it carried out the he@@ avi@@ est injuries , according to the Federal Police .
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to hospital by lif@@ egu@@ ards .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to blu@@ r the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration courts for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system which , in its functioning , corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ et proposes to bring the proposal as a European bar@@ gaining position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
the TTIP will create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings stipul@@ ate that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against judgement .
until now , the parties involved agree with each other on refer@@ ees , there was no objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in matters of fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work on an international investment court according to its own specifications .
there could , for example , resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , especially demanded by large corporations , are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , on which companies can conduct compensation for damages tax@@ pa@@ yers , lev@@ y national legislation or cut down consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations like Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major advance .
the Commission took into account essential points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU commercial ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Business Federation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business association warned that the economies of the economy should be restricted by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this .
it was unclear when talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement have been concluded .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US up to now .
originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
this date is considered un@@ sustainable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ dly acting fol@@ k@@ singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is nearly seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells stories from different places he always records on the map , about his meti@@ cul@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they emerged and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be wonderfully creative .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; will appear clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift in amaz@@ ingly opul@@ ent .
the rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an , &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 states should be sung in a row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and close to the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and positively breaks out certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
guitar and ban@@ jo are enough for him .
one year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a masterpiece has been widely celebrated in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exu@@ ber@@ ant of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no annual list of the influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively .
this sixth decent studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation .
long since the smaller clubs desc@@ ended , the shows here show a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on @-@ head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a band of five .
in the dark@@ ened ham@@ bur@@ gers More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and to folk .
without a word to the audience , the band plays an excellent musician with the broad@@ ly enriched album .
the audience hears that the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can literally throw away the &quot; record . &quot;
only an en@@ core thank@@ ed St@@ ev@@ ens , playing acousti@@ cally a few older songs and eventually dec@@ lines with thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ce
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected in suspen@@ se at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ sta@@ unch
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is said to have made his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questions and for the first time set up with David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to address the first of his six pre@@ defined questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and following his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to wait on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , provoked criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several track @-@ pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; been in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in economics , defence and foreign affairs , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party supported him initially as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also being stack@@ ed within the UK &quot; and Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour make changes to remove the whole idea of a limiting altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow labour and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , ever since he has been CEO , over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament over the last decade .
the Labour leader who has promised a different approach to politics states that he has received &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he is subjected to both &quot; head@@ iness &quot; and stri@@ fe with re@@ tain@@ ers and has instead focused on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who is represented by the Sha@@ de of Economic Co @-@ ordination , if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron told him that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kasper@@ l theatre , &quot; often associated with the prime minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it .
being broadcast on television first in 1990 , the fra@@ sta@@ unch with the Prime Minister was viewed as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Com@@ mons , although critics argued that she had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed extensive reforms .

pounds increase through accelerated pay@@ roll growth in the UK
the pound rose br@@ ittle according to data showing an increase in the wage growth of the UK . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the objective of SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and made assessments of the timing of an increase in interest rates .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 by 0.@@ 84 % .
the FT@@ SE 100 index included an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding stock in the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry equi@@ ties were 0.@@ 9 % higher according to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - have reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he earned $ 2.5 billion through a sale of shares as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estim@@ ation for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger the expansion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ gil@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs for its company , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs could hit J@@ D Sports &apos;s expansion plans , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to potato d@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - and in the Pot@@ ato d@@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ denburg snack @-@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the &quot; potato instead of don@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , the hay potato and meat were put together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster with a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration titled &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had accidentally seen on television .
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer served in its store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea was that the Lebanese have now registered to the patent office in Munich .
there , according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility model .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also works well with its customers .
Met@@ cash launches campaign campaig@@ ning campaign to combat alco@@ hol@@ ism
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million US $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
I@@ GA traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and equipment passes through its annual investors strategy day .
there is much ahead of the game as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take out about five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover a year and by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in the next year in SA and 30 in WA and achieve sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost Met@@ cash around $ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leader of the fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly react to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the Executive Board has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ G@@ AS market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has been around 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operating debt at simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equal selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their shops by rapidly growing fresh foods and offering a better choice of private label foods .
according to Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive officer , Ian Mor@@ rice , says that the price adjustments and load @-@ saving programs at El@@ an are expected to grow and hope that in 2017 the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves praise from the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather pra@@ ising his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; fell into the spotlight by the not@@ orious discussion of Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery trial in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison called out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat a car , and I should hit the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he beat a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp@@ f sh@@ ook a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m quite brave is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ fted a little into the conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player to break a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z at the important decision that starts on Friday and describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all of the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ g &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick made very quick access to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emer@@ gen@@ cies , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explained the emergency situation and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the people trying to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all aimed at stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of immigrants were gathered in a land of no land , and Ser@@ b officials responded with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the police police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back , while more and more came from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
talks with Brussels and other countries have to be held in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the inter@@ cep@@ ted Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or until the end of the year , an agreement would be reached that the EU states would include more 120@@ ,000 refugees including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a swift action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency situation in two southern regions called on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most of the incoming business refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared emergency states , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but Associ@@ ated Press re@@ porters have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities have caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are charged with crimes committed in accordance with the new laws .
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ zed a crowd to force themselves there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national survey
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gains ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in the primary elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , 27 percent ( up 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is can@@ dic@@ ated for the presi@@ dency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds determine which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders posted some gains .
Clinton has a major advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support for men has fallen sharply , and S@@ anders is only 5 points back here .
Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a major advantage in the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advantage in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic constitu@@ encies of the country &apos;s primary elections say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would support them only because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the views are more strongly mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while 48 percent of the Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak channel data Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president to be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s support is also mentioned by Clinton &apos;s supporters ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approval to deal with problems and the legi@@ bility are also cited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the vice @-@ president re@@ jects a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to can@@ on for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton increased his lead ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has declined by 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call on elec@@ tive questions .
similarly as last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors of the sel@@ ections is unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demo@@ cra@@ cies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some key features in the election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den have maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts the three candidates best with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is leadership .
thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders .
since asking H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term of office as an external minister , most of the Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions on the whole .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one @-@ third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsen@@ ed .
it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voters across the country see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tru@@ mp get good grades with leadership .
of the six tested cont@@ est@@ ants , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the primary elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tru@@ mp in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is behind Donald Tru@@ mp in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times
the two candidates now have half of the support of the voters in the new pol@@ l , and others are losing dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the pol@@ l on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also showed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tru@@ mp among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten down with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the deepest fallen , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former governor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place with 6 % .
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 individuals of Republi@@ can voters in this latest pol@@ l is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support among the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some side thi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mp &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for seaside vac@@ ation@@ ers to find still warm water .
a bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea in this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) reports .
on the other hand , bath temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic there are at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
death accus@@ ations were filed against five persons for almost two years after a student died during a can@@ died ritual of a student compound in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood took brutal attack on Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police announced .
officials said he was charged with blin@@ ded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack filled with sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call on the 911 emergency call number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members began hiding utensils and basically set the welfare of the Brotherhood via Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ gra@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the har@@ ass@@ ment every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ o &apos;s family in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and its members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended a charge for the murder of third counts for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold it to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has withdrawn its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest comes , and the house is shaken , yields on bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into a recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides only little guidance on the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate rise and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
for this reason , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have under@@ lined so severely that investors should not concentrate when it begins to raise interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants might find that the whole fuss was possibly exagger@@ ated due to a interest rate increase .
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a view based on historical trends , how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest raises can be volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency for assets to be stran@@ gled 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest increases in the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market in the past 35 years is mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to increasing interest rate , fairly flat in the past six days after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , Chief Investment Strate@@ gic at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ denti@@ ally appear later in the increase cycle and return on margins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate the recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , nominal GDP has been nominal GDP less than 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and anticipate only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest raises in such a fragile economic setting might be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
participants agreed all the year to increase the interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were held at the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could approve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade only gives a 25 percent chance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all up@@ lift cycles between 1950 and today have taken place in a super cycle with GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very soon after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months to date .
the fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
in the case of bonds , the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields fall immediately , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and result in a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , said in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting , Jones says , that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit tightening has expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the large and entire enterprises , which handle the larger portion of their business operations in the US , profit rates will benefit if interest rates increase and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will be po@@ orer , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , as well as financing their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively to three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the clients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet exceeded the average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers are likely to see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast it will take place .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could not be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under a different name .
so if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously named examples , where you actually only mim@@ ic what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC general director dismissed the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 lies far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commissioned new works , I think it really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder should be done to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 was , however , not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to push the commercial ri@@ vals to the feet .
T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins joined The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced &quot; in particular BBC mode . &quot;
he added that he would like the company to &quot; find a hit in our own stable &quot; when the next time it star@@ es in an entertainment series .
however , he refused to en@@ close the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the roy@@ alty tra@@ der for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday has slow@@ ed expendi@@ tures in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but experts say there is now evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only show seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there is evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider growth rates for years and go back to 2000 , this has always been evolving over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the Guardian &apos;s IM@@ R@@ G sales mix .
he stated that online sales increased three years ago when purch@@ as@@ ers started to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting and we will possibly experience that growth dimin@@ ishes .
the Black Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for declining sales .
experts believe that buyers will with@@ hold their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers increased around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe Black Friday , on which the shop@@ pers fought for bar@@ gain , could stop buyers from buying purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that a £ 5 expenditure was issued online for a little more than £ 1 .
for some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion stores in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca by crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first funeral par@@ ables in Mec@@ ca
Saudi Arabia sets off the collapse partially of the huge Saudi Ben Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 injured were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the ones killed when a crane crashed into Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ que .
mour@@ ning filled , mostly dressed in white , the distance to declare their respect , when the first of the dead drew up their final journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ist@@ em cemetery .
the mour@@ ning procession passed away in the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane hur@@ led through the mos@@ que &apos;s ceiling and then on the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi King over the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family was hang@@ ed for the disaster , which left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 worshi@@ ppers who were killed when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central mo@@ or of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents prior to the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ h will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the state Saudi press agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane to fall into an inner courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ ass , which will take place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not release any statements on the Coll@@ ap@@ se de Kran@@ s , and its representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ jour@@ ned the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over bigger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a dec@@ eit@@ ful son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &apos;s .
the crash of the crane arrived in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of each healthy Muslim .
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials agreed that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the members of the killed were to be paid and the same amount of permanent injured .
other injured will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss claims that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British employ increasingly tra@@ des@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has climbed behind
this leads to the opening of 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q retail locations across the country
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is said that Br@@ its will lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified East European craftsmen who carry out work in their homes .
if you can handle a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British are increasingly employing professional tra@@ des@@ people to carry home jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who has the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices has now obsol@@ ete .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at craftsmen and to close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , as eight out of ten buying decisions were made by women .
at the moment , men prevail over the staff .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this to a balance more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the top of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity here is an important topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group failed to reduce the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open 200 new stores .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have been responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and abor@@ tion on Wednesday .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of power .
he was finally acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the prosec@@ utor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary examination , the accused decided that in the years 2006 to 2011 the defend@@ ants were used to receive funds from the bank accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes .
it damages the damage at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also accused of financial problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
in the case of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that the association did not arise at any point in time .
the sports officials charged only expense allowance , and the sports club , for whom they had invested a lot of time and money in which they invested a lot of time and money , came out of the debt . in 2001 liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we faced the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do we carry the club further or do we lock ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his co @-@ worker and co @-@ defend@@ ant he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money to secure our life insurance policies as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debt can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore - in case of appropriate financial success , reimbur@@ sement of reimbur@@ sement expenses had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus on the account had been paid .
for this reason , l@@ ump sum and not detail entries appeared , the former chairman explained the processes .
the accounts and savings books jointly managed the two defend@@ ants , said the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdrawal from the association was not disclosed in detail , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the details of the financial ham@@ mer@@ ing , important is only the debt free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the bank account .
the defend@@ ants asser@@ ted that these were set@@ backs .
this securities account was based on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know how to answer them for a long time .
then he finally thought he had believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor introduced into the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary was justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims res@@ titu@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this wording , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With him you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and diets .
he added 1,000 euros per month to diets , but the actual expense was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the defend@@ ants .
these were no longer kept after an audit , in which everything was considered correct , they declared .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
all the delays can be made in cash , and he said in his statement from his place of residence to the bank of Blei@@ burg .
the trial will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard reaches another 30,000 jobs
in addition to staff cuts that have been running for three years , Compu@@ terri@@ ese will build more jobs when spl@@ itting the company .
the sub@@ missions at the US computer screen H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate clients &quot; business .
as a result , costs tot@@ alling 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will result in a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the exploitation of 55@@ ,000 jobs that has been running for three years has not yet been concluded .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP had roughly 30@@ 2,000 employees .
listed on the stock exchange , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard stock yiel@@ ded 2.3 percent .
the company , which has grown up with printers from Pal@@ o Alto , is currently split up : this is how the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a more dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers after his services , recently came to the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers reduced by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
this resulted in the return of revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted very late to the fact that customers buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more shops online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plan envis@@ ages a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in fighting manoeu@@ v@@ res in Iraq would mainly be faced with rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 per cent agreed .
61 percent of other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
24 per cent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
a cooperation with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 per cent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed , would be 20 percent .
29 per cent were not able to decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
the focus of the fair is on September 27 , connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles and electro@@ mobility .
after two press releases , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; mobility &quot; on Thursday .
the broad audience can visit the IAA from Saturday .
the organisers of the V@@ DA car association anticipate like two years ago with some 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : demo@@ lition of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s tear gas and water cann@@ ons against several hundred re@@ deployed refugees .
European correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he told us by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line was formed and behind the polic@@ eman a water ej@@ ector was ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the public .
in the first place , the officials ti@@ rel@@ essly took mint spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
much tear gas has been spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now been waiting a little back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children who had breath@@ ed the tear gas cried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other refugees came together and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police spokes@@ persons also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world is observed when the US central bank arrives on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision whether interest has been raised for the first time since almost a decade .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , questioned by Reu@@ ters , found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the current level will keep from 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it is seven years ago since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ bide , Chief Executive Officer at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision shall be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday .
death Dan@@ ger at the Delta State University left ap@@ ology
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to tell him that &quot; I &apos;m sorry for the first murder and wanted &quot; he could undo it , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot on someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb spoke to the staff of the emergency call centre that police must send police officers to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
there was no explanation for his shots .
when police took the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , which said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could undo it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb traveled to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle affair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was told by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she was married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but were friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He does not go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen brought him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb went on his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb was awarded a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his life @-@ law exists on the University &apos;s website .
stars who lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor allegedly tried to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly demands its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa construc@@ ts the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
the Group remo@@ del@@ ing will cost 150 of around 1,000 executives around the world .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the airline announced a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies .
among other things , Lufthansa will not be responsible for the passenger business anymore in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the management team headed by Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
in the future , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
until now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the airline airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
negotiations after the judi@@ ci@@ ary strike on this Thursday are to be resum@@ ed in the tari@@ ff conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) .
that divided the union with .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may result in viable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between union and airline led to several strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept in addition to the pilot &apos;s interim supply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa intends to transfer routes to the Group &apos;s own equity line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven in the Champions League defeat of Manchester .
while this brought the left foreign def@@ ender to weeping and excluding him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives the hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being admitted to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s horrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room , he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months , and it won &apos;t play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno appeared to be happy to escape a red card and a sus@@ pending fence .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an i@@ f@@ meter and a red card are due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery now begins , I come back more strongly . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British def@@ ender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming of June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland Team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me , it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ dering by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron doesn &apos;t know The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long until you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided to leave Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on Super@@ Camp@@ s website and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read to my children , for it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposedly describing the plot of the book , instead re @-@ gives a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage and who died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if it would not be enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the action of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is devast@@ ated by the money @-@ gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ lo@@ ping , Th@@ ra@@ ging Once @-@ ler , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times consec@@ u@@ tively to a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Down@@ ing Street speaker said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral circle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees but gave no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ turn .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ punch and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown entity on test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented to results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that lead to nom@@ ination , there - and I said this earlier - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
long ago one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out more races for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the UK @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is especially a team man .
the question how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and out .
the only accus@@ ation you can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales arrives , and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I set up high .
he is an X factor Cri@@ cket Dart Ru@@ le , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very well .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this of course depends on the position of team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ punch and get four squ@@ e@@ aks , appeared , and I didn &apos;t mind .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed guy has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s pole of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ een might not have done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former team mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred r@@ ents straight away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner in the cad@@ res , and in my limited handling with him he was very impressed by me as a young man .
people may see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think there is a punch , but there is no great number of backup sp@@ inners who raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England made some clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor to the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring an abundance of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setup .
I always felt he was created for the International Cri@@ cket Competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cub@@ icle , even if the messages are in tune with what has been said before .
Coll@@ i &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team actors do not determine the schedule .
and you need to remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain out of the EU ) could gain access if the economy is in a sl@@ um@@ ber by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ scheduled new negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n becomes the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ently viol@@ ated Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at enthusi@@ astically said that some member states are so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from their own fault , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split concessions and disturbing contractual changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers visit summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they gain allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wants an outside Great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials in some major cities have come up to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we will stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance races such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist .
it is hard to imagine that they will break a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
that is why some of the ministers possibly deliberately plan not to ann@@ ot@@ ate helpful comments , completely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as it did during the 1975 referendum , inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our 1973 entrance with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can easily remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name for himself as an &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 1990s .
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this includes the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ domestic , most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that if you &apos;re sitting in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of getting to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the non @-@ adopted EU constitution , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 which opened a backdoor .
the press never rejected it either .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly rap@@ tor on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any more time for me - seems at risk of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980 &apos;s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ant tendency and the wil@@ dest bra@@ ins of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ English can certainly say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said when the sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow campaig@@ ners and de@@ pu@@ ties on Monday evening after all reports .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite platform economy - their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - in order to make concessions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already rather disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
asser@@ tions of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fundam@@ ental Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an edi@@ t@@ orials in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month interven@@ ed on the &quot; extremely wind@@ y basis , &quot; which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed examination of evidence and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to give their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ ar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports earlier by tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not supplied , but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the tobacco management of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is sign@@ atories &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; premature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he , said that the BM@@ J claims had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence shows and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion over relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people die annually in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by defining current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we satisfy our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says former CEO of Channel 4
the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal channels that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a hard @-@ controversial time frame against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC general director Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to get in touch with BBC 4 for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC shows or sends programs that are clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t think for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least concentrate on programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as broad support as possible for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financing programs that could be funded without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is one such program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am trying to see how this should be public @-@ legal television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs &quot; go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their seemingly sacred missions for justification of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all those obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window where no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value of this .
of course , you all think , we all think that for 150 £ a year you get a great value , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ , ask me if that &apos;s right , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chef David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their thi@@ an mission &quot; to inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example to the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to the question of partnerships Mr El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and with commercial broad@@ caster alli@@ ances to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction of the moment in which they reson@@ ate with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the pulses work through the power @-@ on of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound may be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said to the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives off electrical impulses to people &apos;s brain to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
round@@ worms do not respond to ultrasound , but Hal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Hal@@ as@@ ani changed the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
when he turns ultras@@ on@@ ically on the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro @-@ bubbles and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the changed mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down to the desired location in the brain by optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for specific neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

the 300 posters are by artists who exhibited their work in the Museum of cruel designs in Bank@@ sys Dis@@ mal@@ and .

V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the weapons fair - through a Le@@ ading of the Excel Calendar - and thought : &quot; let us give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
they played with the invention of a more realistic tender company advertising , but &quot; through the blu@@ ei@@ sh with bright colours and animation it stays stronger . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our front door .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair dates from the area within Excel , where exhibitors are getting fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for life in residence halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I &apos;ve anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entrance to student residence ranges from slightly nerve @-@ absor@@ bing to absolutely sc@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to sweat : people tell wh@@ ence you &apos;re coming from , where and where you have taken Sab@@ ba year , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly don &apos;t love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk to even if your lashes were ign@@ ited and these extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people do it .
people &apos;s rooms often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people wear and put their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t think about starting at university with a relationship
intro@@ vert receive a rough treatment at the university .
her room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space B@@ um@@ mel culture that can lead to life @-@ long friend@@ ships .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I love you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away to get back the energy that I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos anch@@ oring : do it .
a guy in my residence halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship with baking .
since you start the university at the peak of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked something to you . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
their room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ste@@ aling food is a common crime in residence halls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say themselves to use themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , that &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a more balanced deal than my room@@ mate who added her milk a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise , which keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the true sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors for something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter than it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more lu@@ ke@@ warm music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three @-@ hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse accidentally entered the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be ab@@ ys@@ mal embarrass@@ ing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future spouse , go to her , separate herself and see her every day and perhaps see how she draws all common friends to herself ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to give a little reason to your abdom@@ en .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys lying in his not locked room , the border between an Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good coup is funny , but it takes only moments before it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
place a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security by hiding - but never neglect someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
shut your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single occup@@ ants , low @-@ wage ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds row houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner of the corner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the single mother and the little ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build favor@@ ably and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will rush to the housing market .
the business@@ man Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly favorable living space can be created : he builds row houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay here for a great deal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a row house needs the least space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it makes integration easier .
this is different if one puts people in blocks of housing .
each of the six homes currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may be that many refugees say it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs .
what is the cost ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euro , without grounds .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have made my project right through the construction law .
particularly complicated it always makes the im@@ pending dam sword special construction and the parking lot regulation .
cru@@ mb@@ ly .
it is still under@@ lined who in a town@@ house creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not true .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but we built luxury apartments that could hardly afford one more .
my project has the message , also the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the Ger@@ ling @-@ ear@@ ner .
I &apos;ll show you how to build today still cheap and good .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , type on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , as they receive an error message stating that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to deal with the problem , users are recommended to wait either until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more prob@@ able by stream@@ lining the update . it will also be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is completed .
it is worthwhile to make sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued as the phone might turn off half way and this could lead to a demo@@ lition of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde von Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; was founded three months ago and has added another member in its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to the cure .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the ch@@ ess@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , the Chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot record the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search are also to be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that the membership of the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of its connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town .
district office looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ di and the &quot; Alten@@ markt &quot; Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened up a new starting point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consultations , you can also take part in courses .
the Social Foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there was recently opened a new district office .
right next to the shopping market , you will immediately receive sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as health insurance or services of health care and nursing homes .
for years we have been using our out@@ patient care service to ensure that patients with care are often left alone .
there are infinitely many questions .
&quot; also , not in@@ frequently , many benefits of insurance companies are not avail@@ ed because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the &quot; Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ di was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment can be used .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ di complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ di stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined during the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also devoted itself to the club management at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social support . &quot;
the social foundation therefore makes a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment as possible .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 am to 12 am .

ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese is inv@@ aded in Bremen .
foot@@ ball@@ ers were once , meanwhile Tim Wiese , ex @-@ nation@@ alt@@ or@@ hü@@ ter in Germany and at Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim engaged , w@@ rest@@ lers .

on the other hand , intellectu@@ ally , he did not conc@@ ede .

Wiese ran out of business , insul@@ ted the be@@ amer , and threw her before the feet , as the &quot; Bild &quot; daily reports .
the city of Bremen is confirmed by the accus@@ ations , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matter is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that will decide whether the meadow will be shown or not .

men beating a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an
witnesses are seeking the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a sevent@@ een @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of these men now cried to the young man , and struck him with his fist on his face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim suffered a nas@@ al bone frac@@ ture and was bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the m@@ allet , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car to their home and demonstr@@ atively passed several times .
when you no longer saw the car , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male .
with the help of a stick @-@ stick , one re@@ counts on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
until now , there is only a vag@@ ue description of the perpetr@@ ator .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was clothed with a pair of jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks witnesses and guides to call themselves at the phone number 0@@ 6@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller to assume office breaks and invest 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased .
in many places in the country there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , has luck : on October 1 Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field breaks .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his way to his successor in the coming months .
after a modification phase , Müller will open the practice on 12 October , until then he will invest 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the fel@@ lows met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who are currently undergoing her specialist training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and who also wants to enter into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ess and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to operate their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the mil@@ lers bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is involved in voluntary work in the DR@@ K readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ est@@ ausen is working as a family physician , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ lers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle themselves as hous@@ em@@ akers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , a 38 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the mil@@ ler receives a grant of a total of € 50,000 within the framework of a subsi@@ dy programme from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , some 2000 patients come to the field of field breaks every quarter , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
there is another dental practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy will remain in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen .
if no successor had been found , it would have gone too .
who visits Müll@@ ers speaking hour also continues to look above all in familiar faces : assumes the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all the medical professionals have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen re@@ members .
a little melanch@@ oly , she feels already after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the boarding school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;ve always pushed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and loves to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also ramp@@ ed up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to claim asylum can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the focus is on the supply and safety of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear also that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , neither about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia considers &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously informed that Slovenia would also leave arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this was the case , however , that Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia has already been heavily controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sloven@@ ian does not want to seal its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system will not work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasized Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already attempted to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id , in order to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police cars with new refugees continue to arrive in the Croatian town of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it mainly deals with Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in action .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ on with about 4000 refugees , Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border were re@@ directed towards Croatia , according to Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was for people to suggest certain routes : &quot; we can neither , nor do we do this , &quot; it said .
according to the media reports , in the early morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
on Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were traveling around the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia all night long ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
as a result , the postpon@@ ed shift of the former Balkan route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary into a somewhat further west @-@ west route could now be seen as predicted by observers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control opportunities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
he did not call the details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; extensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since consistently issued a good report concerning the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side some 300 refugees continue to be stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
it is still unclear whether the remaining refugees want to move on to the Croatian border .
Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning at a local evi@@ ct in Hor@@ gos : he held the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not currently deal with very high refugee figures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey on Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants on dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distributing maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there are still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchange hack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay $ 30 million
Sup@@ ran@@ spar@@ ok is said to have been part of a cy@@ ber@@ crime ring that is accused of gaining access to un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the captured information should have made insi@@ der shops on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states in the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other accused in the case continued .
most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have acted both in the US and from Eastern Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce in Mannheim exists for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
people do their worries , sometimes quick steps , sometimes comfortably walking .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the parade ground .
keep city lanes .
puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle four big boards each with the heading &quot; Before I die I want .... &quot;
with this action , the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce attracted attention to its 20th anniversary and is entirely confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and conversations as the volunteers .
while some pass@@ ant @-@ by spontaneously falls to the chal@@ k and adds the sentence for &quot; my life affir@@ ms , &quot; &quot; read &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not suffer for long , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
over and over again , there are little discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy .
for this reason , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wants to express themselves publicly is understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and death remains stuck with tab@@ oos , thus the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped a lot to open people .
an app@@ rais@@ al which An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the funeral and mour@@ ning staff belongs to the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted with personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce sum@@ mon@@ ed honorary officials , she reported immediately and had been there with the establishment in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
they are all trained carefully .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can work well with her job and experience and experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , keep it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the Amb@@ ul@@ atory E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and is denom@@ in@@ ational @-@ independent .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows the training , training and supervision of the funeral and mour@@ ning atten@@ d@@ ants .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
the tablets described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
even there , further personal wishes can be recorded on postcards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply chain lowered its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trading 45 minutes prior to the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. told you to earn a profit between $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year ending next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
despite the increase in price increases , the smaller prospect comes to an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher strokes on bo@@ d@@ land transport of heavy and large packages that are raised from November .
the company said it was nonetheless expected that earnings will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields good yields if you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vacation employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , for example the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which analysts predicted by Z@@ ack Investment Research analysts predicted .
sales rose 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts in@@ quired about z@@ acks of $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipment to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , bo@@ d@@ transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express Unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex stocks fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to raise the main interest for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is lo@@ oming over them at the end of the two @-@ storey meeting hall .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the central bank has a tw@@ o@@ fold mandate from Congress : keeping US occupation and prices stable here stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled from the unprecedented appeal by the short @-@ term interest rate that lies close to zero since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets may make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and even though it is only a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they are watching , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a interest rate this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts reduce the strike by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average j@@ umped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy keeps the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that she wouldn &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of the last month after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered this month , whereas the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation , when to raise interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events have not occurred on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the technical decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world &apos;s currency .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere suggestion of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down their monetary expansion &quot; caused confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also provide advice with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
var@@ n@@ ishing , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which stands for interest increase , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , despite a limited noticeable impact on the growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner .
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives went back on these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest fixed interest .
the youngest turbul@@ ence does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of a interest rate because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should rush ahead .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Leben@@ shilfe for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees are coming to Germany this day .
to give you a warm welcome , does not work without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 courses .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seekers home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , it &apos;s a different lesson than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s Pedi@@ atric Pa@@ edi@@ atric Society encourages nutrition for healthy breast feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS tries to inform women in a sho@@ cking way how important good food is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively influence the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ried sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction permit for the EUR 2.3 million expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited field of gym@@ n@@ astic building at the Bern@@ dt &apos;s sports grounds is moving forward step by step : in the most recent municipal council meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction proposal was unanim@@ ously agreed without any major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , the Board adopted a proposal for an &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ ground first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be built . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned use of the roof surface for solar installations is the background of the planning : &quot; in this way we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the case of &quot; liberation &quot; it was again about the ti@@ lt , which for energetic reasons - different than in the development plan - should lie below ten degrees .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the a@@ version permits no &quot; exceptions &quot; - but Bern@@ ried &apos;s municipal council is usually more restric@@ tive in the case of liber@@ ating contracts .
but it is not a recurring project when it comes to sports hall construction : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the expense .
subsidies are expected from the promotion of school and lati@@ tude .
in the next step of the process , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will be presented to the State Council office .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the administrative district , which confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the Supervisory Board conven@@ es on Wednesday , September 23 .
if plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the remaining In@@ ner Station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , are to be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees were informed of the plans .
the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Hospital since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who is to succeed , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the lead from 1 October and to move with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means &quot; appreciation &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the field of internal medicine , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inner station .
for the next two years , f@@ isher with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree to both houses , until then next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which has more than 35 beds , is to be closed defini@@ tively in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim was completed .
Land@@ mil@@ ner J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met ru@@ mo@@ urs that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß couldn &apos;t say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is currently a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the quasi move to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened again and again in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and the ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand @-@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Lion are called for the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight ( 8.@@ 15 pm ) .
although the German Bundes@@ liga leader is the clear favorite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce .

Jag@@ dun@@ ce with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the aber@@ ration on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in use , as the police reported .
after a shooting , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was initially unclear .
the criminal police investigation was established .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the bodies of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who have been missing since Saturday .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the youths were killed and their bodies thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police hur@@ ried on Wednesday .
in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , was also considered to be suspect and the investig@@ ators led to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a devotion to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
the det@@ ain@@ ee reported to the authorities in police interro@@ gation the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and put the cor@@ pse in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a death toll on him .
the further investigations are expected to shed light on the immediate circumstances of the act .
refugees need lodging : study warns of housing gap
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are seeking a affordable ble@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing stands for a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since commen@@ ced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last paid apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units will have to be built every year by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study on behalf of the Association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed in Germany this year .
this means that 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial reception .
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing numbers of refugees .
the study also makes substantial short@@ com@@ ings in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a house deficit which is growing from year to year .
currently there are already around 77@@ 0.000 dwell@@ ings in the metropol@@ itan areas , Matthias Gu@@ en@@ ther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in need of emergency rooms .
young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the l@@ utes on the housing market .
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita in recent years has fallen again for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a restart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing construction .
in this way , the property tax is wai@@ ved and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats is subject to limited time .
according to the alliance , attractive tax write @-@ downs are also needed .
the support programme for refugee lod@@ gings in the state bank Kf@@ W is already well underway in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , at 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the remaining 300 million euros had already been rec@@ alled .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have a free time : Croatia and Slovenia line up corridor
there is practically no way to get through to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose their way across Croatia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zagreb An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to grant transit across Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the isolation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television station RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border on the eve of the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new legislation that came into force on the same day also makes regular asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this eventu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but it was people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia on Croatia &apos;s neighbouring country .
most of the media reports are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , both by bus and taxis .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees do not meet border f@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
in Hungary , however , there are hardly any more refugees after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 injured people .
just before the closing date on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed , Hungary , Hungary .
the convic@@ ted threatened prison sentences of up to five years and expul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transp@@ onder@@ s &quot; set up at the border , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
13 families with small children and two elderly people were among the applicants .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees .
practically no one has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian views , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rejected asylum seekers should be de@@ ported there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the transit zone in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shut@@ ters were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centers in the border area was rebuilt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country has also reinforced its border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around the 20,000 migrants , however , were still in the country according to government data .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met on foot regularly .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; after the bridge ceremony on Sunday we were busy meeting up when ten people were suddenly standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ einer mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , but because of the traffic flow with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and drove the br@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first boiled the unexpected guests , with snack and drink .
we said the same , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not allow himself to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers were switched to a regional train in W@@ els on Sunday evening in W@@ els from a ICE train to Passa@@ u , after the announcement that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still to try the border .
the regional train was shut down at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest linked with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , a two @-@ b@@ ump @-@ race sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has sent tens of thousands to us now is a logical result of hypo@@ critical politics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of ai@@ ding in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly put the position of the Hungarian government in the lymp@@ h circle of National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the refugees will have to find that the &quot; promised land , &quot; which they have invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to produce decent conditions for asylum seekers in the face of the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant neighbour@@ hoods
Konrad has all hands to do with the provision of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad already got a grip on the chaos at the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen Research Centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees , who came to Austria on Monday , was also without great fuss , &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; fe@@ at performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke about a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 districts last year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the Federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the national govern@@ ors .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria , things are going well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Con@@ rad .
in the morning it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born to clarify how the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations on the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
private persons can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
in addition , you are hoping for hotels that are vac@@ ant in winter .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it is not possible for district employers to maintain a certain amount of towel holder or size of the sky@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , in contrast to the Interior Ministry , is more successful in accommodation , Konrad explains with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom you don &apos;t say without further to the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier are not responsible for the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
so far , the own quest for cross @-@ section has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better allocation
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the placing of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment since people can be subject to these measures without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites are to be tested for their suit@@ ability .
the city chief critic@@ ises the division of refugees inside the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has activated the further course of action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist for the time being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the guards would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is now also introducing controls to its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the course of the Germans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; industrial line is officially closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved into , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be le@@ ased out to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T chief Hannes Swoboda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later also to acquire some of them .
from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to co @-@ operate with the new neighbors - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some things : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
€ 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the province of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to be postpon@@ ed by the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has gotten gains in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where they sell among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I thought for a long time to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Linz show@@ room that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has been given birth from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why some woman gets into rap@@ ture when seeing a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional woman cannot answer with the last certainty .
maybe it &apos;s due to a nice bag of every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ du@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
some people also connect with the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether he expresses himself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , prov@@ okes journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presi@@ dency el@@ ic@@ ts the campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the fo@@ eh@@ n hair@@ style is a concept for many in the wine @-@ growing village on the wine route .
some people in the 1,@@ 200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant place are related to him over -@@ ump@@ teen corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ stadt rider Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous shoots , to which in addition to Tru@@ mp , the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt ( 2014 ) - with the statement that he would certainly be successful even if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
while there is respect for the performance of the family , there is also the opinion that Tru@@ mp is already a bit &apos; a big mau@@ l &apos; , says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ du@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to High German : the len@@ ders , she says .
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation of the real estate group was the initial purchase of land in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he once was without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking testim@@ onies of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; like that , it &apos;s not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born trumpet , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement sees the American rather dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so alert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the land@@ lady Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like many c@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz spent a visit something for the church organ , which generally suits well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t know the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter , Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tru@@ mp was inter@@ viewed for a long time , saw 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , even in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .
the Upper Bavaria commun@@ e Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain@@ eering village . &quot;
from the hand of the Vice President at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ eering villages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local alpine club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .

at least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in Today &apos;s reviews .
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull missed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tation , was in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this disadvantage of the board didn &apos;t seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spectators in the five main cities , compared with Today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , in recent months , the gap to sunrise has closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August Today , Today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 from Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 proc@@ eeded .
until now , sunrise at 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers is at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could play a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily beat The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 44@@ 6,000 spectators on average .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia took 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour there were 7@@ 20,000 .
hot Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollars minute which did not manage to over@@ run Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor was envel@@ oped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked in with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you may accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds his lips sealed to the final on Thursday
all three women are ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and in doing so called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods the last rose ? , &quot; could their rep@@ lies become a game addi@@ ct , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors .
Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly named them - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other for the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed S@@ ams &apos;s energies , I felt they were pretty compatible and I thought it all over the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week showed her that Wood &quot; could be the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose if she did not , she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after an impressive open day of training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ nes chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers had ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t during his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ nes the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the match .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly during his press conference after the match .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Free@@ In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by Special Team Co@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his lost catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at an Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ nes and his massive Australian ret@@ inu@@ e had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ nes left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ nes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ nes compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
all in all , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free voters are calling for the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high numbers of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
party and faction leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger at the beginning of the fall of the F@@ W in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a heavy crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there is no new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Day Ques@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lasted until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually , completely different main themes were intended .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lay the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Prot@@ ected Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as it existed during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not so , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seekers want to push free voters as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum claims : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform federal standards across Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria pul@@ ls away , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more responsive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the state policy in large @-@ wall cities should not fall under the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a long @-@ term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; torch will remain the order of the day : education policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; intermediate level plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools , where an extension of the upper secondary school from three to four years will be tested .
but that does not go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be spe@@ eded up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that we want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shot rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 year old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ gling , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police had used tear gas and then shot into the air , before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known to which they can kill , but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces being formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers ha@@ sten@@ ed the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week over certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
building site planned in the city
the property at Em@@ der Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den City wants to market a property of about 4,000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
the plan is to use the premises for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
one is waiting for appropriate offers , it says on the part of the city .
the investor question is not yet clear .
no contracts had yet been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located at the ring road / corner Große Straße , already a few months ago and the building was demol@@ ished .
project H@@ ieve : details lying on the table
plans for the holiday settlement on the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor publicly presented plans for the project for the first time .
some investors are still worried - they fear selling their leisure activities
months after locked doors were negotiated , sal@@ uted , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement are situated near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; publicly presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ der Council .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , who presented sec@@ rec@@ y to the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end went on to the offensive from the system @-@ building management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the project , which is about ten to twelve million euros , has been in discussion for months .
v@@ eh@@ ement reactions among hor@@ net land@@ owners who came to the meeting provoked the pictures and new details on the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and member of the Board of Directors at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this will be a huge l@@ ump that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
he also fears like some other project critics that traffic will increase sharply due to the planned size of the plant : &quot; there must be entire bus loads to be reck@@ oned , &quot; says Schulz
however , what is happening on the well one hect@@ are of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we must have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ isch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the development plans are still variable .

Google starts dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donations campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations as they flee from war @-@ torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation request on its blog .
instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled to Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / were doubled to 11 million dollars .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many fled from the war sh@@ attered Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an edi@@ t@@ orials to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are ab@@ normally obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 comparing two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cers - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
in the meantime , BM@@ I remained in those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments at 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes was completely dis@@ solving and at 28 % in some cases .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and partially at only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol in general better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , it remained stable at around 8 percent in the medical therapy group .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , says the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ aster Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching higher BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.2 % ) and rather improved diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years , compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit to survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone also added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated those genetic changes that have attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a theme that is increasingly attracting attention in the fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is especially interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument in her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take up all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the USA dra@@ gged down a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem is non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he took violence , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
poison control centres in the United States report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , who swallow a strong alcoholic san@@ iti@@ zer , so Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of in@@ comes of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centres report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go out in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children dis@@ infection inten@@ tional drink while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mutation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens are said to have mixed dis@@ infection with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ infection products ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent which are very appealing for children .
hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children , few sp@@ atter can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison emergency center in K@@ ans@@ as Hospital , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it then it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four spra@@ yers from straw@@ berry du@@ oden@@ um hand@@ set disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was taken to treatment in an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally prescribed by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a physician who treated her at the winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ent her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had hit the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredients .
health authorities &apos; employees suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth class planned to poison the &quot; common &quot; teacher in New York State by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished her from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the vain plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action against the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
in the event of a rear @-@ end collision between Nordr@@ ing and Her@@ mes , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver was slightly injured in a rear @-@ end collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver went on the cross@@ bar towards the district traffic industrial area and realized too late that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he boun@@ ced into the rear of an audi@@ tor with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta .
in the accident @-@ involved vehicles , there was a damage of about 10,000 euros , the police announced .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready to ride and had to be tow@@ ed .
sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules : no di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic

Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under greater control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers @-@ Mittel@@ feld@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the ran@@ gers aren &apos;t there .
people here talk not only about the R@@ angers &apos; return .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there &apos;s a lot of excitement in the old Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , Dei@@ la swe@@ ars .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted Celtic battles , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now stands at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly like that - but we have to go on .
we really need to really support Celtic because that makes players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously at January @-@ transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he announced some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about the signing of new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to interfere with the On@@ eness of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer will have this high season time to integrate what you saw with our own group this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no performance commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tan@@ na@@ dice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the executive board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but it is said that the decline must end on the pitch .
I think that Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will return the guys to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen desp@@ aired against Hamilton Ac@@ cords in order to see a seventh consecutive division victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic on the upper edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ on@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Inn@@ es : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , who haven &apos;t won the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it increases overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labour for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 per cent was above the figure of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch a man being brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ sy is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see backgrounds in the US , and since more applications are available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery is held to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it un@@ emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ sy &apos;s closest friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the prisoner &apos;s story how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ sy had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a report by Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all details again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ sy is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ esis would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can contact for .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after wet police pursu@@ its persu@@ aded to come out of the c@@ anning river
the c@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he over@@ spoke the man from the c@@ anning river .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , only a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called to a house peace break in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race sport
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he has found himself under difficult circumstances when it comes to the positive cobal@@ t test sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he with@@ held 18 months for the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and did not want it to &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to walk up@@ lifted head and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to think about what I do with my license . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had sent the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity section had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will appoint when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , reign@@ ing President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the view that it is personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly behavior and might make people outside trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they need to take my license and cast me away , and I have no doubt that what I say is now contempl@@ ating them .
but I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s frustr@@ ations have built up with the long @-@ lasting g@@ ob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to he said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse deb@@ its , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees wrong@@ ly applied mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been like last night .
it could have been like yesterday the whole day , which was also so .
but it had it so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy fights against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring @-@ fights
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critici@@ zed Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee allowed the storm players &quot; ring games &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely disgu@@ ised remark to the Storm team after his team had reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the fli@@ ck@@ layer of his crew and said that tac@@ kling was only concentrated on her &quot; contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the critic@@ isms of two leading trainers on his team agree with him as she insi@@ sted that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time and time again - I didn &apos;t hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson replied about w@@ rest@@ ling when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques all year round , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ x a real focus and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this is emerging again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a te@@ di@@ ous team , and Wa@@ yne said he would take care of a mess .
but now he has a team that can play and that we look at as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all of his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like them .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us .
six weeks ago , they probably didn &apos;t think of us when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game of Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are there breaks and don &apos;t give points something exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm Team has released on this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin on Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bians with $ 200,000 deposit after drug arrival
a man who could possibly have a lifel@@ ong sentence due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ threatening penalty for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c ar@@ gues that there is no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café would have been a harmless background .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the risk of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of $ 200,000 as security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ ous declarations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he gives off his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and stops at an exit lock from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : cab ri@@ ps apart
on Tuesday evening , a truck driver was severely injured in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe .
two of the three lor@@ ries involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to avoid in the last moment to the left as the police hur@@ ried .
the driver &apos;s cab of the crash culp@@ tor broke completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 am .
a damage occurred in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone by girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the telephone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hockey .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately aler@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of them and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research that used words to search for in@@ decent pictures of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed that he did it as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet , &quot; and he then &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an addiction , that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people .
he admitted that the search on the computer was done by him , but said it had happened because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the jo@@ inder indictment of having taken in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , on 25 January of this year , viol@@ ated the obligations and did not appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
defence counsel Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg would not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el postpon@@ ed the verdict until October , in order to receive background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was given a deposit in this case , but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was admitted before the date of the sentence into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers avoid small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ d@@ gates left people increasingly at smaller border cross@@ ings from fear of discovery and arrest .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn river Inn in Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on the German side by foot over bridges and dam@@ s .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and for@@ warded to registration .
compared to the week of the week , there were significantly more refugees arriving at Munich Central Station .
around 700 people have arrived in the capital city alone until 8 am , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : pioneers of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm fires in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air is currently flowing into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) distributed in Stuttgart .
the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who was pulled over the Atlantic over the past few days .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ see circle with bu@@ cks ranging from 60 to 90 kilometres per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the masses are making it : every two years , the car manufacturers show their innovations at the IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is especially moving on the compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the compact class cars are currently in high demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations have been accounted for by the Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Pub@@ lication Days 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic conceptual cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year .
one of the biggest Premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Opel offers an entry under the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen also offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines count .
unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a five @-@ door model .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which can be seen at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a distinc@@ tly sporty GT version .
in the trade , he comes next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan s@@ lick wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti fits into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is based on manufacturer information at 170 New@@ ton@@ meters ( Nm ) .
launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe will be in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not quite new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n depos@@ itor laid their hands on the front end : here , the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ painted and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was mainly moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch@@ screen and for the first time integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , a series of re@@ visions and new variants such as the new Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI have been added at the IAA in the compact class .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court gave right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison cant@@ een of Te@@ gel , who was accommod@@ ated in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates fundamentally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , they can even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer &apos;s data , was now on the open foot , had been moved to a larger cell .
his office ar@@ rests due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the State of Berlin failed .
but the judges of the Constitutional Court raised the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce and rejected the case for re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
the Court of Appe@@ als decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of liability for compensation were decisive for compensation , an equ@@ ation was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear a fair@@ ness of the legal protection of the personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of cash compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of convic@@ ts in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so they did not speak to a prisoner in April , because he was locked up naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ worthy of human dignity .
furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had unanim@@ ously agreed to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 .
for three months , the former plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated in a gli@@ de cell between 15 and 21 hours , as in the Karlsruhe case .
in recent weeks the Berlin pris@@ ons had hit the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore included again and again 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to ra@@ ckets , it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the judicial review office , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of young talent , 19 shall drop off in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany ?
according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel , Germany , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated decisi@@ vely in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) Apartments are needed annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing , however , is dramatic because of affordable rental properties : annually , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing estates fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
too little is that from the perspective of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social housing needs to be created annually and therefore the federal government would have to invest a funding amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists and Federal Minister of Agriculture agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investing in residential construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research ( IAB ) , the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
however , the refugees in Germany are not systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but it is crucial for the integration of refugees to work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the state society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ es@@ hardt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of employment for refugees for recognition of labour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while there was a working ban on asylum seekers from up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as does the Resi@@ denz@@ pflicht , which limits asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , it has become increasingly the point of view that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market more quickly .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking knowledge of German .
until now , there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the creation of networks is , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , the Königs@@ weg for the integration of labour .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fle@@ dged parents give their children to the day@@ care centres , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; it is only very important for parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ zy@@ l , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators increases significantly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacity - for example by allowing more technical schools .
in the countries pupils without knowledge of German are prepared for classes in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ings from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no Bundes@@ land asylum seek@@ er or tolerated the study - the only exception to date was Berlin , sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance .
study willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
because refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ dung do not receive any benefits after the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance law more if they begin studying .
the latter generally do not receive a b@@ af@@ o@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ o@@ sts .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 this span shortened to 15 months .
but this funding gap needs to be closed , as well as by Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually conc@@ ede to Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ state @-@ state right to develop a new state @-@ religious relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organisation that takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
duties also belong to the rights .
thus the representatives of Islam have to agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heed against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to off@@ end such conflicts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will hen@@ ce@@ forth be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination unit and a general gender equality law since a short decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U series of mur@@ ders showed that police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and why international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ist convention should commit to Germany must become reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is in a position to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , says District President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as man@@ - power and capacities are concerned , we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be incorporated into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery invites everyone to buy health cards right away .
services rendered could later be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the federal states .
and in the long run it is highly question@@ able to submit so many people with the limited range of services that the asylum application law fores@@ ees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , the doctors are especially making the language barrier possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are becoming more informed about their illnesses than other patients .
they are required not only in clinics , but also in medical practices .
many refugees were also helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , under the refugee crisis , there are clearly more ill @-@ treated disabilities , and among young people it is about HIV clari@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in some other cases , German doctors are coming from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the health care label may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed education system , some refugees even doctors .
however , in order to be allowed to practice , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill after estimates of the Federal Psycho@@ therapy Committee ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most are suffering from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat and fear of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional de@@ af@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , said Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ically ill seekers of asylum in the social welfare offices can submit a motion for psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social welfare offices , material labour@@ ers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
recei@@ pts will invite you to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts .
the aim is to attract each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to day@@ dream in the man@@ ege on the tiles .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current management stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the Cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
thus , the gift for the fan@@ atics is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to take people away from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ r@@ ity cocktail with cosm@@ opol@@ itan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst who is his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3,000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus program impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo brothers also understand their craft .
the Cuban duo wants to easily compete with the heroes of the silent movies .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - these words identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art on the mast is supposed to capture women &apos;s hearts by storm .
besides numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ v@@ age , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the cir@@ cus also fascin@@ ates with intuition and arti@@ stry .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little different and fascin@@ ates with her mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often a subject in various animal welfare organizations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a stand : &quot; it is not good for our animals , it doesn &apos;t work well either . &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , will be read from the eyes as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the man@@ ege .
the first commandment , therefore , is good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra stu@@ ds , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always do our best and with all our heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to your performances every day from 17 to 20 September daily .
on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5@@ pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the animals are open every day from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe delivers false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by alle@@ gations made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
in the past month they had bu@@ sted him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
announ@@ cing the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese , the spokes@@ man for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones , which warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of Parliament to end immunity in parliament and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected reduction in jobs leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars in the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has over $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing un@@ paralleled , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; explained the company .
it divi@@ des a company established in the 1930s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electro @-@ equipment and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to address the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this sector , based on the belief that closely focused enterprises perform better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ers face the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of his story , his participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain about the European Championship .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that is not well healed .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in touch with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical perspective , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player attempts to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere disorders since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 157 cash games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 that have experienced most of the vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a prone time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and give players who need it to take a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to move through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope to lead the club to his first European Cup triumph with his management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has never worked with Arsen@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gave us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up now has become more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ a@@ ign against a miserable life ) began 2015 as the year of the man with the goal of questioning the culture which hin@@ ders men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of battle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication guided through social media , with its emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the response is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even though in reality the isolation is dominant .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic value - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health far more deeply .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was turned up@@ side down .
every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which was shining through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when watching football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the y@@ earning of Ross into Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can definitely relate to it , even if they often hold back their feelings .
as an employee of telep@@ hon@@ y , I explained : ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends are one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the completely re@@ designed backdrop to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know the difference your friendship could make .
friends will be broadcast on Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total of 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria Me@@ ets to Help PS@@ G to Mal@@ m Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his match against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held track when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria made less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the track , but afterwards they missed a series of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and S@@ haft Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against Swedish champi@@ ons , as they do not only aim to qualify for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but to improve on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later changed in the game against his home town team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and to look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals scored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which last weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over at Manchester United in the last month , and he indicated why when he passed into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ ti &apos;s pass behind Malm@@ ö @-@ defense before finishing in Johan Wil@@ and past beautifully in the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who suggested Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent .
but in addition to a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s pole in the 3@@ 4th minute , they did little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some incorrect closures and bad connections , last but not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was only in the first half in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had started it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who turned Di Maria to a shooting shot , which was defle@@ cted by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth win of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ lown up a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before substitute player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games do not suff@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core g@@ athers 2.5 billion $ through share sales
mining giant gl@@ en@@ core , which is based in Switzerland , is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected 2.5 billion $ on Wednesday as part of its huge debt restructuring plan .
the Gl@@ en@@ core company registered in London stated in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately 1.6 billion £ to pay off its own debts .
the company , which lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling raw material prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn push@@ es demand and has a devastating effect on markets .

the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core last week announced the $ 2.5 billion share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to eradic@@ ate around one third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new hol@@ dings of 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term sustained growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw material prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

X@@ av@@ i : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola prevented a change to FC Bayern in 2008
X@@ av@@ i World and European champion has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
a few years ago , FC Bayern was shortly before the obligation of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion winner , four times champion league winner , twice world champion , two times European champion , twice European champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to Qatar as al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals that he stood before the Euro 2008 before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in that time Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a supply of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to have a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; f@@ us@@ el@@ ig@@ ge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot;
as a reminder , in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European Championships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he got me away with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , turned the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s King &apos;s victory at the end .
matt Dam@@ on Play Vari@@ ety in Film Maker
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the African @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , do it during the occupation of the film and not during the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted dis@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invite people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the film directing rights ; Dam@@ on answered that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WH@@ ITE that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women &apos;s comments arrive at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after killing Michael Brown in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved a nationwide impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured restra@@ int .
in February , singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hat@@ eful group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media outlets invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which had just finished their 7th season , had never seen a competition participant who could complete all levels of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten managed to finish the final .
to the final task , climbing was part of a 75 @-@ foot rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Big Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 , or had a lifetime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went to The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changes the life , it receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;d have any res@@ ent@@ ment over it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt just as if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for a eighth season , filming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
mint AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins have wasted a chance to climb in one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , albeit only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Kis@@ sing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and enabled three of us .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go very concentrated into the game .
the designed tiger eye Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three @-@ hit game ever since he had four hits against the Seattle marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the bed@@ rock well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked mark@@ edly better from the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear at the end of the seventh inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man with whom he was faced , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen into a two @-@ run .
with a pair of runners and the finale run on the second , Ver@@ hagen put the third ba@@ eman@@ ager Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th consecutive times in the Major League in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe suggested a double play
after Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inner ring , the Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed man , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his Fi@@ fth S@@ ava .
Detroit benefited from an un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es at the start of the game .
the Tig@@ ers scored three ra@@ ids in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ushes made a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third ba@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed second , achieved a one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not hit particularly well , but he got the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the Reli@@ able right handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns on six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to an infrin@@ gement of the throw school .
he is examined by Dr James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder cut , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30

Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he proposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we were glad that the cup of military involvement in Germany passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing through our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on site for refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian interior minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner announced on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , and no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany did not send any refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it was agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could pick up a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Security and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have crossed the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary to Austria .
their destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , proposed a special summit for next week .
Germany had started with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a common procedure in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the Federal Government wants to support the countries in the initial absorption and distribution of people .
the League will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel on Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those who would need protection will also complain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who do not have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was unanim@@ ously shared in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border with Serbia on Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest that the border with Romania was to be set up with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gling over Romania , says Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to of the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were the first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , there were thousands more migrants on the road to the Greek border .

under the ice cap of the Satur@@ n@@ ington En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sw@@ ells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the Cass@@ ini spac@@ ecraft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the moon flo@@ ated slightly on its orbit around the ring plan@@ ks .
although this exchange movement is only small , but still too large for a permanent cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) of Tuesday .
the researchers presented their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; leaf@@ let .
it has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
for example , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; already discovered ic@@ ep@@ r@@ ushes on the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds already in 2006 , sp@@ it the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn .
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , astronom@@ ers concluded at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .

no fruit diet - man@@ goes contain much sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slender line are often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy however : they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. above all , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruit thus supports ey@@ esi@@ ght , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and have a pleasant smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so even green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet dishes .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the night falls in the valleys of the Alpine north side of the F@@ öhn , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz announced on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday and in the night for Thursday the fo@@ eh@@ n blows with storm strength through the fo@@ eh@@ igh @-@ valleys .
after f@@ us@@ her on Thursday morning a marked cold front crosses us , which brings powerful rain falls , wind gu@@ sts and a drop of temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area across the British islands in a powerful southwest current .
on the alpine side , the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows from 60 to 100 km / h in the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys with bu@@ cks from 60 to 100 km / h , sometimes even in the Ur@@ ner@@ land with more than 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can advance in places to the neighbouring middle @-@ country , and even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer provides summer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the alpine slope .
here , rain sets in , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps must be reck@@ oned with some more than 100 liters of rain per square metre in the next 48 hours , since large rainf@@ all has already fallen in the last few days .
on Thursday morning , the fo@@ eh@@ n dri@@ es out the air , as a result , a cold front rolling with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind refresh@@ es strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures are notic@@ e@@ ably reduced .
the following days present themselves in the north east with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sun@@ nier and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now holds a Martin Luther Place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday on the name of the German Re@@ former .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
on Wednesday , Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live in hiding for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the place symbol@@ ises that the tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a de@@ pra@@ ved sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
according to historians , his negative impressions may have reinforced him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the fall trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
in the beginning the picture was for Ot@@ mar Alt , who expressed his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adjusted to the respective topics , this may seem quite dark .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles that focus on topics such as cross paths , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ therhood .
this applies to several partners spontaneously : this applies to the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its main emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the biblical places on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today , into current connections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal ima@@ gery of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible text of Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
this makes the 75 @-@ year @-@ old twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately triggered for the bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing already took place with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work this up , so that I might be able to carry on with the Father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to bring art again in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed way : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is now shaped by advertising , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; fall in &quot; into the images , let them act , discover and sense what force they have : &quot; the image seeks his counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , on Tuesday , stood in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like him to understand life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not care to completely grasp the Bible , but chose the most important , even mysterious themes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th .
start of construction for BM@@ X train approaches
plans made , place found , company commissioned , earth hill for a circuit model@@ ed : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway it was already finished .
failures in politics and administration caused dr@@ y@@ ness , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will go into effect in October , the first joint council , Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck , was now able to communicate with the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; memorial break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , with the Bundes@@ liga a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football is responding to the worsen@@ ing situation in Germany and ass@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to every individual to get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next Wednesday I am in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football could and will help .
but the crucial turn@@ out must place politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal states also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 pros have a clear sign when they will carry the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drama of refugees is going on everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can be football fans , no , we must use our jet force , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Championships against Hungary this Friday .
Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a great community work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensing agreements had started their own projects in their places was great .
it is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; that we spent is lived in football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association jointly with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government will each provide 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already retri@@ eved the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
report : board of directors lost an eye in the event of an accident
the board of directors of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the case of an accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he almost ble@@ eds , was power@@ less , then ran out of the street - he told us this last week , &quot; quotes the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday output ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren &apos;t spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ched a photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes at night races in Singapore at the weekend as little as reserve driver for the two Stam@@ ob@@ il@@ otes Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in@@ quired , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus vs. Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback by Marco R@@ eus have finally broken down in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will be absent from the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be there again on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high burden of its professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its trunk position on the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change on the go@@ al@@ keeper position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of stem cell Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised the football teacher to the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , when Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is deployed in all of Europe &apos;s league games , Tu@@ va left open .
with a high probability , he will also play the second game .
the for@@ ge statement by fellow players R@@ eus that the final campaign for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , means that Marco Wei@@ gl considers it understandable : &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robotic car : government wants pioneering role for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer when it comes to changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t talked about a &quot; new mobility age &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states that come together with industry representatives at the International Motor Show .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid switching to digital radio .
a test track on the 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; examine the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to ensure that the maximum speed allowed for self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles is increased from 10 to 130 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometers .
the Federal Government also intends to favour a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only envis@@ ages man as a driver .
in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver gets more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically feasible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less cars on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are not to be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the Germany site estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to approximately 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D vice @-@ president S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the test organization Dek@@ ra concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect to believe in this at all in 20 years .
in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving vehicles account for 33 percent in the United States .
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey conducted by digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire drive on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least be 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fourth person would leave the car under no circumstances under any circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l says team @-@ and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ Euro
according to present @-@ day status , the Düsseldorf @-@ based company wants to kick @-@ off only in sing@@ les from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision will be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championships in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was on the flight at this time on the flight to a sponsored walk in China in the long term .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are now no longer a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared single @-@ European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the S@@ etz@@ kl@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the European Championships 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo lack@@ ed and we became European champi@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ranking List . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United made a serious injury to the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins that look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 at Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially dis@@ appro@@ ving attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one dies , one gets into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which a lot of effort has been carried out : to dev@@ ise the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was specifically hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have brought 14 tons of material to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather trousers out@@ fits with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ron@@ istic fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
playing with a doll would not have allowed his parents to do so .
he later brought up fashion designing himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
but I bought it later , of course .
for his first show of his own show he couldn &apos;t afford the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as fashion @-@ niche
in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in a great deal for customers who , for example , continued to work on blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work any more , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en shop .
instead , fashion is important again .
fashion played a major role in the beginning times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , was then replaced by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for a few examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past stit@@ ches , shows an increasing order potential .
anyone who does not use a niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the association association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery .
only they can wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been cut off .
private specialist shops and also the wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products barely reach customers on this way .
today mass @-@ ware is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively over chains .
in addition , exports , current to Russia and the United States , are also weak@@ ening .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the association seeks to score points also through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains about the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialised in embroi@@ der@@ ies and spi@@ kes .
to counter the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically most of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why an existing design often only varies slightly to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ acted the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine stops small spheres in some places .
the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith master in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration : &quot; I had nothing to do with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the United States , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends are not to be touched , but Disney is still vent@@ uring into a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it &apos;s not about a re @-@ film , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first movie with the magical child girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in the times of the Great Depression in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins over 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws are still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already determined : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rob@@ b Marshall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI urged to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open more broad@@ ly to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday for a group that was commissioned to steer the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should engage in attracting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to promote new start @-@ ups and drive reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list on the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not in question for investment .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guarantees a legally state business environment and makes the market more open , said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to companies and ensure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will permit bor@@ der@@ lines to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ limit in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to give consumers a much higher dose of thri@@ ft .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding working paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish should be increased from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m of fish at the end of the food chain , such as Hai@@ - or sword @-@ fish for &quot; economic policy reasons . &quot;
however , large predat@@ ors are already so strongly polluted with mercury , that about 50 per cent of the catches are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the still valid limit values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ comprehensible .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to exac@@ erb@@ ate the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 mg of mercury per kilogra@@ m according to F@@ ood@@ watch .
however , F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are mostly so low @-@ charged that they already comply with the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which is heavily enriched in predat@@ ory fish across the food chain .
the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; small amounts of the nervous system can cause &quot; already low amounts . &quot;
on his homepage , the Federal Environment Ministry declares that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury is particularly affected by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations meet the Green German Bundestag &apos; Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , for example in the Elbe , Rhine and the Danube , was &quot; dur@@ ably and comprehen@@ sively exceeded , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; had quoted in March from paper .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
