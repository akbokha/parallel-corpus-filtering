Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Teher@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
in the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution will also go .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing the ongoing settlement of Israel and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal imposed by Obama to the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two continues to deterior@@ ate .
in March Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken by Barack Obama , a meeting had refused this with reference to the election pending in Israel .
in an emergency call professor , shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb talked with a somewhat angry voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
it was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
inside the house the officials found the bodies of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was stuck on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could undo it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who travelled to the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular story professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ gra@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb has made the fatal emergency call sometime after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were happy about his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal background .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed too nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
the Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had some health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy mean that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would have no guarantee for an automatic way to establish an Assistant Professor .
President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs notion . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the flight from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs track later , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said she knew he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
he completed his doc@@ torate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met together by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried a few years to teach her the guitar play .
he was the women &apos;s black .
all girls melted away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously together some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter that was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both on a summer season three years ago .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ ark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time , after Lamb finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that anything was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the clearing and gro@@ aned together .
I mean they both had a good sense of she@@ ar .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the congregation in a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the watch @-@ watch , while the university &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police were now saying that Lamb had shot the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss described as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox is talking about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty beside me , and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an im@@ pending documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simul@@ ated wire and a mes@@ hing length of it , with the princess of Wales at a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be seen on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of almost five years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN leader again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Minister of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria that they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks in poll@@ s , it has not worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which no one also gained a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mps through stamina and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
the Tru@@ mp card values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week found that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages to say about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans sees Tru@@ mp temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is critici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is true in the first country of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think he did not have the personality to perform effectively his office , and almost six of 10 Independent say that his temper@@ ament does not pass into the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they set up their nests , republi@@ can voters keep Tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the past week four of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four of ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a multitude of GO@@ P voters will see Tru@@ mps Camp@@ a@@ ign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mp leadership while the anti @-@ tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ use .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp is re@@ aping the majority support .
he took points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ y and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a scar@@ let majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their opinion .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have fixed their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp is strongest competition in the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as frequent for Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rape &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the immigration and fishing point in the public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic pron@@ unci@@ ation of Tru@@ mp will keep decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp on issues of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tru@@ mp will seem to do .
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new levels .
on Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; pol@@ itely anno@@ yed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a re@@ et@@ op house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers cost a square meter most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top places , however , the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros ni@@ x - per square meter , well @-@ noticed .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Go@@ ze
double Tor@@ shake in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it went .
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have made a dream start to the FC Bayern in the witch @-@ chair of Pi@@ ra@@ eus in the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won the Champions League in the Champions League at the Champions League in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol hits ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
in his 28th hits in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership , Müller received good help from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who caused a shot of the world master as a f@@ lange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &apos;s captain Philipp Lah@@ m had promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium , and the Munich word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus won his youngest six home games in the world class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 there was also Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went courage@@ ously in their offensive efforts , but often too imagin@@ ative to work .
the attacks were often initiated by game reloc@@ ation on left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which rarely came through the former Braunschweig O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck right from the right , when his flan@@ k struck out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct acceptance , the Tor@@ wart Roberto par@@ ted with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
even though the Bavaria got their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set the needle sti@@ cking .
but Manuel Neu@@ er was on the door@@ keeper of Manuel Neu@@ er .
for example , when he made a shot of Ide@@ ye on the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er Guardi@@ ola defended a four chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ der , sat outside .
the World Cup hero has only given the green light after the final training , &quot; said Sports Officer Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky , &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , that &apos;s already malign@@ ant . &quot;
in the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the slain Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th . ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear for 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still on it .
before the game it was in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ alle .
after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ med Bavaria fans in their spect@@ ator block apparently provoked the followers of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus in words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went out against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study .
the good news : in case of aband@@ on@@ ment , the risk decreases quickly .
smokers have a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this is the result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to qu@@ itting smoking , smokers lay the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fa@@ che .
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth decay are cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the gum , the DI@@ f@@ E emphasizes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent gum infections in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of cavi@@ ties .
people who quit smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks again to the level of qu@@ itting smoking , explained the author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ einer Boeing said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to good dental health until high age .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of denti@@ stry are affected , the DI@@ f@@ E divided .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists encounter rem@@ nants from the late ancient town of Cologne on the Rhine shore
for the repeated time at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne archaeological findings have been made .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ischer Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , &quot; said Museum Manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a specialist office for archaeological soil care .
in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards the arch@@ e@@ ologists were now found five .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained Trier .
beside the remains of the fortress and the church , a cemetery with some 350 graves had been discovered which probably belonged to the church .
young woman of freight train cap@@ tures

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the stri@@ pping of the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds significantly more traditional dishes in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de presented the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TTIP will be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings envis@@ age that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to rise against jud@@ gements .
until now , the proceedings agreed with each other on the arbitr@@ ator , an objection to their jud@@ gements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , they want to work according to their own information on an international investment court .
there could then be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , especially by large corporations , are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , the company claims damages to tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was especially critici@@ zed that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission included essential points for the reform of the Federal Minister of Economy , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the business of the economy through too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this means .
when discussions on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) talks can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States .
originally a framework for the agreement was already at the end of this year .
this date is considered to be no longer available .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy @-@ acting folk @-@ singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost caught by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells of different places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ lian and delicate arranged songs .
where they were born and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has been proving to be a wonderful creative Irish .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; appear clever@@ ly composed songs that are harmonious very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time can drift into great opul@@ ent dri@@ fts at any time .
the rum@@ or of &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 US states should follow .
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , seven Sw@@ ans have already appeared and positively canc@@ els certain expectations .
in this case , St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced .
live with guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) appears in 2005 a sophisticated masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bor@@ dering ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album goes into the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no annual list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then served on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic replacement parts .
this sixth regular studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but by programmed sequences or beats and plays with every effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation .
long ago the smaller clubs have gone out , the stage shows are shown here for the colourful spectacle of ne@@ on brow@@ band and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is part of a five @-@ strong band through Germany .
in the dark @-@ held ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly mature St@@ ev@@ ens turned back to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
from the audience you hear : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can therefore throw the &quot; top in the bottom . &quot;
in addition to an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens is modest , playing acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally tends to fall under the thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s questionnaire
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns is expected to debut at the prime minister &apos;s questionnaire with tension
the new Labour President Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s questionnaire and put himself on David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be checked by the media and the Labour MEPs from the vicinity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said he could skip some meetings to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment to the member of the shadow cabinet and following his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour president , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration ceremony for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several titles stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had stood &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour president to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called upon differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a guide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also stack@@ ed within Labour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation in winning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it is only against government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour President , David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory boss over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour President , who has promised another politi@@ cian , says he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the fra@@ gil@@ ity of the prime minister is too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that it is subject to &quot; impact &quot; and stri@@ fe with re@@ tain@@ ers , and instead of concentrating on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic ministers , is represented by him if he does not participate - for example , when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the Unter@@ haus , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove from politics in the style of a &quot; j@@ ava theater , &quot; which is often linked to the fra@@ gil@@ ity of the prime minister .
since she was first broadcast on TV in 1990 , the questionnaire was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the under@@ house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms .

pound rises through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose sharply with data that indicate an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the goal of SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July , the result grew without bonuses in the United Kingdom by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the same period .
this percentage has been the fastest and experienced assessments over the timing of an increase in interest since 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index included an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over offer of the Riv@@ alen AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core climbed 5 % after the mining giant said that he took $ 2.5 billion by a stock selling as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline by 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estim@@ ation for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports climbed 3.1 % after the company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ gil@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power would compensate the higher labour costs at his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

rather even more .
at present , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 turns through .
like Wi@@ kt@@ oria Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vi@@ kt@@ oria from Poland .
however , since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the bi@@ eber building : here you are living I@@ dol whose posters are hanging in st@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening .
the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her mother E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Wi@@ kt@@ oria should sit in the tenth grade in the high school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory scho@@ oling ?
who ju@@ cks it ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also Bi@@ eber himself does not .
he has taken care of anyway .
for the advertising in the advertising break of the supermarket he paid three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ Pi@@ ping company , many , many dollars on the bi@@ eber account .
and with every doll that looks like he goes and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber also cas@@ ses .
when J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , you wonder at the window pane .
he is said to have killed more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
others stress that bi@@ eber is finally just in the US and Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in place 1 .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many N@@ ul@@ len first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese on potato d@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it goes both - and in the Pot@@ ato Valley , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger snack owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen in television .
since then , in his shop there is a barbecue grill , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea was to enter the Lebanese patent office in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
like a lot of meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only so much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding is also good at its customers .
met@@ cash launches ground resistance campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - inv@@ oc@@ ation
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branches in front of an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground resistance campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million US $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing on social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , which distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop@@ keepers who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , if the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and appliances will conduct its annual investors strategy day .
there is a lot in the game since South Australia and Western Australia make almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries after opening its first markets , and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million revenue per year and Met@@ cash 250 million $ by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost basis could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales rose by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.6 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade . met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass was contacted last week .
i@@ G@@ AS market share has declined by 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Retail , which has approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has been accounted for by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction of operating debt in simultaneous printing on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to equi@@ p selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week , and I@@ GA retailers to improve their shops by fast growing fresh foods and provide a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive officer Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading facilities at El@@ an are expected and hopes that the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in the year 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise for his own behavior according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight due to the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbitr@@ ators , with Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Kyr@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen as he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp sh@@ ook a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m quite rich is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take into account Kyr@@ gy@@ z at the important decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick has made very fast the ascent to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency stand , closes the border , holds refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and ri@@ pped the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indignation .
the people who fled before violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian deployment police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some have returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be discussions with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nations bloc in a strict meeting in Brussels could not agree with a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the shr@@ unk of Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be concluded that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not put his hopes on a swift action by Brussels or from his neighbors .
the emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could lock roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison guards were used to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who have the right to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come about by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of offen@@ ding crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border crossing points with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to push down there .
about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway of Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her to the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent previously ) , while S@@ anders is second , by 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he has been chann@@ eled for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the Democratic voters of the elections .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates they will support them .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more consistent than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders achieved some gains .
Clinton holds a big advantage in women and gu@@ sts , but these projections have decreased .
your support for men has fallen sharply , and S@@ anders is just 5 points back here .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has fled , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
Clinton has yet another big advantage in the older voters .
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the Democratic voters in the elections say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some privileges and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only one quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the Democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters say this about their peak channel data Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question , why they want them to be the candidate is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approval to deal with the problems and the voters will also be quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the vice @-@ president th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the Democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters are asked for the election who would be their second choice for the party , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from scratch .
if Bi@@ den decides to channel not for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of S@@ anders increases , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ fish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , with the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
similar to the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters is unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics in the elections of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
individuals consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best cut off with the three candidates at hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
democratic voters of the elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions concerning H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server will continue as an external minister , most Democratic voters of the pre@@ elections are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions altogether .
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters altogether : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the voting rights see Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tru@@ mp receive good notes on leadership .
from the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off at hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves near Donald Tru@@ mp on a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close to Donald Tru@@ mp
the two candidates now have half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp nationwide in large numbers . the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well with demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tru@@ mp among republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ y , is beaten down with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell at the lowest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are 6 % on the third place .
the error margin at the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in the poll@@ s - he lands at 19 % support for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view of a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some side screens for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mp &apos;s faith in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp said last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if the peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing seekers to find even warm water .
a bath in the north or Baltic Sea should be a rather short treat at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , dividing the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic there are 25 degrees in the Adriatic , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
almost two years after a student died during a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders are filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police .
officials said he had been loaded with s@@ wollen eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g became power@@ less and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood in order to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of the Brotherhood began to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ gra@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g has repeatedly been added to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the third count for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for false attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to be responsible for the involved persons , but if there is an organization that has been officially or in@@ officially - this has been sanctions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an interest rate will come , and the house will fall into the banks , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into a recession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only small instructions for the economy .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and took 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore representatives of the U.S. Central Bank emphas@@ ised that investors should not concentrate on when they start to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could find that all the excitement was exagger@@ ated due to an interest rate increase .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a view based on historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the acquisition of interest increases can make things volatile for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency for net income from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may be reflected again the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study to what happened after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the road to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis that Bob D@@ oll , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return of return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , there was only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest increases in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have taken the whole year to an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could approve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade shows only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all hei@@ gh@@ tening cycles from 1950 to now have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the fixed income was also volatile , as the market takes an interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
in case of bonds , the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the hei@@ gh@@ tening cycle , the bankrupt@@ cies fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to closer ties between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting that the markets have already adapted themselves to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rowing has increased and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens their strategy .
in the large and entire company , companies will benefit from the larger part of their business activity in the United States , benefit when interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and as well as financing their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively to three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will become a major problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ entary Committee Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s conserv@@ atives critic@@ ised the sender for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ver@@ du@@ bbing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins took the voice of The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leading Par@@ liam@@ entary Committee and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that does not do the private trav@@ eller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer differ from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; stupid &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its only under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and give new works on behalf , I &apos;m really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the audience when it did so in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to tread the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins took The Voice on - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; produced in special BBC fashion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased in August at slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down
for over a decade , virtual shopping has been dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities .
but experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales record to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago as buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is sw@@ inging , and we may experience that growth decreases .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for subsequent sales .
experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases before this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the shop@@ pers fight for bar@@ gains , could keep buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 was issued a bit more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion stores in the city towns .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered together as 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those who were killed as a crane in Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mo@@ zh@@ ee .
mour@@ ning filled , mostly dressed in white , the route to clo@@ the their respect , when the first of the dead came up their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funeral procession passed on to the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane ran through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king over the construction company of Bin Laden was handed down because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 wounded , a san@@ ction .
the bodies of 29 Bet@@ ern , who were killed when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central mo@@ zh@@ ee of Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram came from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officers have already said that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man said that the bin Laden group would not have left the arm of the crane , when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company was prohibited abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which collap@@ sed into an inner courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ zh@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month .
the bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ ored the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ zh@@ ee as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage that is necessary at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the relatives of the ge@@ aring are to be paid and the same sum of permanently injured .
other wounded receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe has climbed behind
this leads to 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q sales sites nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City boss @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Britain put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out work in their homes
if you can deal with a hammer or a brush to the painting of walls , you seem to belong to a minority nowadays .
the British increasingly employ arti@@ sans to perform home@@ work jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe , offering services to low prices , is now obsol@@ ete .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which are based on craftsmen and to close 60 sales offices of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions are hit by women .
at the moment , the men weigh the men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must move this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of the leading companies listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied just 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher announced a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trends King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the K@@ lagen@@ furt Regional Court , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball court A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ for@@ estation .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also indic@@ ted for office abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted from this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the defend@@ ants were cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the pre @-@ examination that the defend@@ ants were used in 2006 to 2011 to receive funds from club accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
the damage has been paid to around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the repro@@ ach of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that the association was not at any time an asset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports officials only charged expenses and the sports club for whom they had invested in 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the Passi@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do we carry the club further or lock us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take over this task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money to put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , it must only be made debts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , the pa@@ yout of the reimbur@@ sement damages had been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the reimbur@@ sement damage was only years later , namely , from 2003 when a plus was paid on the account .
for this reason , flat and not detailed bookings seemed to be explained , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes .
the accounts and savers were administr@@ ated by the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed to the association in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the financial support , it is important to have been the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros had been transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were resi@@ dues , declared the defend@@ ants .
this securities account was based on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if something happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed , justified by the function@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage recovery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why damage compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first defend@@ ant declared that he had not agreed with this formulation , because the association had never had any damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he has never paid a cent salary , he merely calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and diets .
he added 1,000 euros per month to diets , but the actual expense was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the accused .
these were after an audi@@ ting inspection , in which everything had been assessed correctly , they declared .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
all the deport@@ ations are in cash , and he had to travel from his home town to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard reaches more 30,000 jobs
in addition to the need for personnel mining for three years , Compu@@ terri@@ ese will be disman@@ tled further jobs in the spl@@ itting of the company .
the positions of the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ esen H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 places in its corporate clients .
as a result , costs amoun@@ ting to € 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) should be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the disman@@ tling of 5@@ 5.000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard stock was 2.3 percent .
the company &apos;s large @-@ scale company from California Pal@@ o Alto currently split up : this is how the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the future @-@ related areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers according to its services , set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under EUR 25.@@ 4 billion .
this resulted in the proceeds in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting and massive positions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and getting more and more shops online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of about 5@@ 5.000 jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conflicts : majority support the anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would largely be opposed to rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent showed themselves .
that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent will be positive .
24 percent are opposed to intervene in the conflict .
a cooperation with the Syrian rulers Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 per cent of respon@@ dents , would be 20 percent .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
at the heart of the fair stand up to 27 September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility .
after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto &quot; Mobility &quot; on Thursday .
the wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday .
the organisers of the V@@ DA Car Association expect about 900 000 visitors two years ago .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion at Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water laun@@ chers against several hundred brought refugees .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violent erup@@ tion at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police , a police line was formed and a water designer stood behind the police station .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially continued to spray pe@@ pper@@ mint .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn a little .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone .
children who had breath@@ ed the tears of tears cried .
other refugees gathered in themselves and suffered from breathing difficulties .
the Serbian police officers also suffered injuries due to the use of lac@@ ri@@ mal gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world watches when the US central bank arrives at two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest will be raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this now , now think that the F@@ ed will continue to stay longer and the interest rates on current status of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will keep .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest has been on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rough outlook on global conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death shake at the Delta State University left excuse for exc@@ itation
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could not make it happen , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shot at someone and someone killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lamb said to the staff of the emergency call that police officers must send police to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him .
there was no explanation for his shots .
when the police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to undo it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman ever loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb sent 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing his own life on Monday evening when police killed him .
President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs notion . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities on Tuesday said there &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was married about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .

&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police arrived on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a PhD title from the Delta State University , as its habitat is on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor also allegedly has to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug owners .
all this certainly demands his tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
the Group restructuring costs 150 of the world &apos;s around 1,000 executives around the world .
there are , however , new negotiations with the pilot union .
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheapest Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of real@@ ignment is a contribution to € 500 million per year from cost and revenues syner@@ gies , distributed the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no more executive vice @-@ president for the passenger business in the future .
the budget airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the Executive Board of Executive Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
in the future , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
until now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airline company operates under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the judi@@ ci@@ ary strike on this Thursday .
that divided the union with .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wanted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forecast record &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between union and airline resulted in several strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept concept is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left foreign def@@ ender to weeping and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives the hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was built into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then played fantastic , and then this happens .
in the dressing room , he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red map and the suspension of a mo@@ m .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al presum@@ ed that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a T@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I &apos;m , my way to recovery starts now , I &apos;m getting stronger again . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the PS@@ V defeat
with the European Championship in France , the England Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in another direction so that it looked like he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad here . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a F@@ oul@@ der of Chris Sm@@ alling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a matter which all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost mem@@ orized .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 , decided by Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , as it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead of giving an index of the film version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , meets the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . &quot; a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that wasn &apos;t suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly as a summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he is admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears , like the local environment through the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ lo@@ oming , Th@@ re@@ stri@@ cken Once @-@ ler , despite the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ vering , sn@@ ur@@ ish being , &quot; that is said in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR job was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times behind a child .
a down@@ ing street speaker said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral bure@@ au .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there was no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a forward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali developed as Sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cre@@ denti@@ als are aimed at results .
there was no question mark in Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said that - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had the control of his own destiny .
if he hopefully strikes further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he did not get so good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man .
the question how much time a test drummer receives to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and forward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first put Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top shape - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer I highly recommend .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same odds as before him , but this depends on the team &apos;s position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin Bow@@ ler and would receive four Qui@@ cks , di@@ pped up , and I don &apos;t have anything against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ een might have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team colleague J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an Open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ eds immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no great number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a few wise additions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dressing room , even if the messages are in line with the previously said .
Coll@@ ys Team@@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but coaches and team actors do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Great Britain from the EU ) could win an authorisation if the economy continues to be in a loud noise until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ checked new trial strategy to hold Great Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ates itself due to Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend re@@ port@@ edly said that some member states are deeply rooted in various crises , such as the EU , and not always from their own fault , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contract changes , which they mostly do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided on their annual meeting that it may not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
prime minister and finance ministers climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves before a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always around me .
my European friend who wants to look outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally speaking , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as with the exagger@@ ated long endurance races like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also an end @-@ to @-@ end force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist .
it is hard to imagine that they are going to tear down a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie British to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore some such ministers may even intentionally not intentionally plan un@@ helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new trial was a P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the re@@ trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be on its cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as it did not have been inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can still remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ straight @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s .
with all its ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
to this end , the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ gers , telephone @-@ chi@@ pping foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ Indians who have most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar about her , but found that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one gets better ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened his back door .
the press has never missed him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ s years to repeat a mistake at that time and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe is - I think it &apos;s friendly - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ariah Ten@@ dency and the wild bra@@ ins of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touch @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even has stir@@ red me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a brood @-@ site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to maintain Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ess economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign for exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of on Monday by something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic report &quot; last month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month interven@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptionally wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; at the P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was supposed to have received from British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ wrote the references of BA@@ T on public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained means to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not supplied , but include several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a branch financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the tobacco management of P@@ he also took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence &quot; for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or limitations is discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been premature as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted previously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people die annually in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System twice a year .
due to the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says former leader of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ on and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC to make public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from sen@@ ders such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with BBC 4 for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which were clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t think in the medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least put his production at least on programs that do not do or put on behalf .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a broad support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am tired of seeing how this should be public @-@ lawful television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence was on the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts will show what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how to sell the East@@ on .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they meet their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions for justification of 4 billion £ / USD , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all those obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value there@@ from .
of course , you all think that you get a great value for 150 £ per year , but for people who are for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Rei@@ thi@@ an mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , form and maintain their Rei@@ thi@@ an mission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC &apos;s production would be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and they should change and enter@@ tain themselves in the public @-@ legal television stations in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partnerships El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful on television will be shown , and with the commercial sen@@ ders to make alli@@ ances available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they are be@@ amed with tone pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels acting on ultras@@ onic waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people for treating symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
F@@ aden@@ worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found it did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the enhanced ultras@@ onic waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion duc@@ ts and are found in the membranes of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , the Chal@@ as@@ ani changed the worms so that some of their mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion duc@@ ts .
when it turns ultras@@ on@@ ically to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and transmit into the worms , where they turn off the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible at bus stops and in the subway trains and that require a second look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important announcement : drive from 15 to 18 September with DL@@ R ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) you read in the font types of the London Under@@ ground and the hall@@ mark of the DL@@ R line that turns into the image of a tank .
in September a flock of arms dealers will drive with the DL@@ R ... customers are asked to help at the stop of the weapons fair .
the 300 posters are of artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of cruel designs in Bank@@ sys Dis@@ mal@@ and .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped in the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ @-@ pack of In@@ bus keys , by which it is claimed that &quot; access to around one third of bus stops on the planet can be obtained . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transportation for London is not funny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not funny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

after Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become critical and try to bring political works to the public outside of galleries .
many artists join forces within protest movements to work and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters sal@@ ute the commu@@ ter in the subway .
the Am@@ nesty video has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , who works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist , who also works for free .
V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was astonished about the silence that reigned around the advertising for the arms fair - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
they played with the invention of a more realistic corporate advertising , but &quot; through the blu@@ ep@@ rint with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us to shar@@ pen awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a step of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors are fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student homes
eleven years ago I moved as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance to student resi@@ dences ranges from easily ner@@ ven@@ tively up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie : people tell wh@@ ence you come from where you get to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ mite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to figure out the people you like in contrast to those you might not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers were .
let people leave .
people often turn into drinks recipes , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert will receive a gross treatment at the university .
her room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ room B@@ um@@ mel culture that can lead friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I have used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow milit@@ ant is exhausted - and send SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking apro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
since you start the Uni at the climax of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck is at the doors of people to imagine a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked you something . so , and now please smile when I give you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friends .
their room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise at the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery .
poorly mixed cl@@ um@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when they ank@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student dwell@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say themselves to operate themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my room@@ mate who added her milk a dish@@ washing agent to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise , which keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of saying to the people who sit in the glass house .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors if it makes them something to make Drum &amp; Bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even more loud music .
when they stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went to her three @-@ hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would enter into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , make sure to separate themselves and see them every day , and maybe you will see how they pass together all together friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your sub@@ lim@@ b a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his non @-@ closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ bbing is more fine than it seems .
a good stone is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give you a valuable and am@@ using lesson through security - but never miss one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
shut down your door , and place your keys into a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but do not store their possessions on the ceiling anymore than twice .
holiday homes for refugees , sole educ@@ ators , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ er
the real estate company Markus Gil@@ dner builds terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the educ@@ ating mother and the t@@ anner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build today still cheap and good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushed to the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people remain in a great part here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the refugee stream , we need enough housing in the next decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people are bringing people into living blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees will say it is again peace , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be changed easily according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
do the building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have written my project correctly .
especially complicated , it always makes the im@@ pending dam value special construction and the pitch regulation .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly .
it is still under@@ lined who manages three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
in the cities only the place is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did the residents react to their Rei@@ h@@ enhaus project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not true .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable apartments ?
Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but they were built in luxury apartments , which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the educ@@ ating mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ er .
I show how to build today still cheap and well @-@ built .
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after the installation , as they receive an error message that tells us that the software update is missing . &quot;
to handle the problem , users are advised to wait either until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the telephone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do this by using the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is completed .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone might turn off half@@ way and this could lead to a crash of the update .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; was founded three months ago and recorded another member in his ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Supreme Court of 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation that President Alfred Klein received .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot charge the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; as an expression of his connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town is seen .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the Social Foundation and opened up a new starting point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consulting , we can also participate in courses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the social foundation is moving down from the mountain into the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg square .
a new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office recently opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , you will receive sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as care insurance or health care services .
for years we have been serving our out@@ patient care service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are so many questions .
&quot; also , many services of the insurance companies are not used because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Bürger@@ ital and for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physio@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre see both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
this is because it is essential for a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined with the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro dedic@@ ates itself to the agreement at the age of the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ alizing co @-@ operation . &quot;
the social foundation therefore makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar environment .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 14 o &apos;clock , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 6 pm and Saturday from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

in the city of Bremen , meadows had just cut the hair when he saw , as outside a parking space W@@ äch@@ ler presented a penalty for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
a meadow bla@@ sted out of the business , insul@@ ted the be@@ amer , and threw her the fine fine @-@ sentence before the feet , as reported as the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper .
at the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I will decide whether the meadow is displayed or not .

for three days , the authorities have torn up the 4@@ 500 plants and burn them .
men insp@@ ect a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time , the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now cried out to the young people and struck this with the fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al break and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the bat , he left his victim first .
from his friends , the injured young man was now brought home .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and drove there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle , the last one went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was once again attacked by the bat and another male person .
under the aid of a stroke , one checks on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
up to now there is only a vag@@ ue perpetr@@ ator description .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been approximately 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and sign@@ posts to sign up under the phone number 0@@ 6@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
also Sam@@ t@@ Community Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ ce@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing in the next few months with half a job .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the ri@@ ms were met by Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completed their vocational training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to enter into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the garbage cans would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far I simply inv@@ oked them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller pleased the idea to operate their own practice in the future in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the garbage dump bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in frac@@ ture @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hannover followed the stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and he was appointed senior physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is engaged honorary in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness frac@@ ture @-@ Vil@@ sen .
starting from September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) specializes in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the rub@@ b@@ ish , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as hous@@ et@@ akers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and endurance EK@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
as part of a funding programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that practice continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sam@@ t@@ Community Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come into practice Fel@@ lowship breaks , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
there is another medical practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor had found , it would have gone .
who visits Müll@@ ers consultation hours , by the way also looks in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms .
with their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the medical professionals have practiced for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen re@@ members .
a little che@@ ek@@ ness already felt it after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the boarding school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your husband supplements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square metre plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to submit a asylum request can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clearly , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , nor the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already well controlled as an external border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia does not want to seal its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government ha@@ sten@@ ed , the first refugees had already tried in the night @-@ hours to Tuesday in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id , to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could attack them in the near corn fields .
according to local media , since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles meet with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country was reck@@ oned with about 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were transferred to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serbian border , which previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it is the way people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , at least in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day , further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been the entire night of the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
in fact , it could actually come to a slightly further west @-@ west route to the observer of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners since then have a good testimony of what concerns the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border transitions Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees are now going to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday early in a local sight in Hor@@ gos : he holds the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high refugee bill at present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not spacious min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .
stock h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who are accused of having gained insight into yet un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the exploited information , insi@@ der transactions are to be made on financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the investig@@ ators reported a total of more than 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately trapped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes against 32 further accused were in the case .
most of the defend@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have acted both in the U.S. and Eastern Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid Mannheim has been composed for 20 years
there is an active operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
people do their concerns , partly fast pac@@ ing , partly comfortable stro@@ lling .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep the city lanes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are four big tables each with the heading &quot; Before I die &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy made aware of this action on their 20th anniversary and can be confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy is available to the pass@@ ers as well as questions and conversations as the volunteer staff .
while a Pass@@ ant interven@@ ed spontaneously on the chal@@ k and the sentence around &quot; my life be@@ j@@ ah@@ en , &quot; &quot; Read the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffer , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again , there are little discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that at the end of this world I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian plant Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carrier of ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ olds .
the fact that not everyone wants to share in the tables openly , however , be understandable , and finally it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped to open a lot to people .
an app@@ rais@@ al that shares An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid .
the dying and funeral service belongs to the volunteers of the first hour .
through personal experience faced with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was looking for honorary officials , she immediately reported and had been at the foundation in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 honorary citizens - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another wart , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows training as well as training and supervision of dying and mour@@ ning companions .
all two years are offered training courses for new employees .
the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
further personal wishes can also be recorded on postcards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply gi@@ ants gave his prize to a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ man transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire about 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , which are at an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher set@@ backs for bo@@ d@@ ging of heavy and large packages that will be raised from November onwards .
the company said that it was nonetheless expected that earnings before the previous year will increase due to cost reduction , higher revenues and because of growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income yields the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which asked twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research to predict analysts .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts expected six of Z@@ acks to $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipment to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result was reduced due to higher operating costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected conference in the year Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week round a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to lift the Lei@@ tz@@ ins for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is lo@@ oming over them at an end of the hidden , two @-@ storey sitting room .
the map is a reminder of the fact that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the central bank has a double order from the Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled by the unprecedented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it is solid , recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is also only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is sufficient justification , continued to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which does not secure the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance for an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts dimin@@ ish the impact by promise that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average j@@ umped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have to go very far in its explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
even before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the proposition expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed down in August , improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.2 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level that F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth .
the market has recovered in this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the H@@ och of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when increasing interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events have not occurred in the financial markets and news about the weakness of Chinese economy over the last few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US central bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision making process technically .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere reference to Ben S. Bern@@ anke &apos;s time in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow their monetary expansion &quot; caused confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also advise other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements that apparently cannot be linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ er , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest in interest , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its Lei@@ tz@@ ins by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recogn@@ is@@ able impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ er .
a year later the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability in the first place during a serious crisis , as Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for Inter@@ est at the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ence does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of an interest rate , because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think they should hurry up time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany this day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
she also likes to teach her 74 l@@ ences .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seekers at the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , it is quite different from other classes than at a proper school .
Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to clarify how important good nutrition is during the breast@@ feeding period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck breasts which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , giving babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation of mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der sports hall
the Municip@@ ality Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ out building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds move step by step : in the recent municipal meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction contract was unanim@@ ously reduced without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the body had decided on an application for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected with non @-@ mit@@ re first and roof over@@ stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations : &quot; this means we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
in the &quot; Liberation , &quot; in turn , the roof ti@@ lt , which is prescribed for energetic reasons - is different than in the development plan - under ten degrees .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
at the cost , around 2.3 million euros are calculated .
subsidies are expected from school and lati@@ tude promotion .
in the next step , the construction contract for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the Council of the Council for the examination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is expected to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Land@@ rä@@ tin Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a decision on this is the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should the plans be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees in the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move with fishermen and the further interior station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who do not work with Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the staff are informed about the plans .
the replacement of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , which has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice near the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October onwards and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in every case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the area of Internal Medicine , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) specializes in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside station .
for the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree to both houses , until then next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had planned this for 2018 if the currently ongoing renovation was completed at Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital .
Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met ru@@ mo@@ urs that the house , which is owned by the Federal Reserve , will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer about the qu@@ asi move to Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; positive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and comprehen@@ sively &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as a chief physician for over 30 years have not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened in recent decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the palms of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are called for tonight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .

Jag@@ evap@@ oration with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a cor@@ n@@ field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in use as the police told .
after firing , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought into hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the crime police were determined .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence
a crime scene has led the police to the bodies of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
one of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to violence .
the bodies of the young woman were found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , is considered to be suspi@@ cious and the investig@@ ator led to the place of discovery of the bodies .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning after having arrived at home after a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was finally found .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the bodies were found .
according to the authorities , the police interro@@ gated the police interro@@ g@@ ating the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds and put the cor@@ pse into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ tri@@ chter on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him to the burden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the further investigations are to bring about the closer circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gap
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the distribution of distribution on the German housing market has long begun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many major cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with income @-@ based citizens around the last affordable apartments .
in order to meet demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built up by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is a study on behalf of the association of association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed in Germany this year .
this means that 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first @-@ place accommodation .
many come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment .
according to Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers stayed in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study also makes considerable savings in the housing policy of the last years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany is shooting a housing deficit that will be bigger from year to year .
currently , around 70@@ ,000 residential units were missing in the metropol@@ itan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the lau@@ ts on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita in recent years has decreased for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a new start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives are to boost the social housing market again .
this way , the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments may be suspended .
according to the alliance , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are necessary .
the funding programme for refugee accommodation in the State Bank Kf@@ W is already good in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start was reached on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros .
now the project could even be pushed up .
refugees have a free time : Croatia and Slovenia direct corridor
after Hungary there is practically no passing more , since more refugees choose the way across Croatia .
Zagreb canc@@ els the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Interior Minister and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees moved to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary closed its border with refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , are also practically superf@@ lu@@ ous in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can go through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia on Croatia &apos;s neighbouring country .
most stem@@ med media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town of S@@ id both by bus and taxis .
immediately after their arrival , they would have attempted to walk through the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter gren@@ ades .
the border stri@@ ves other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v Civil War in the 90@@ s .
min@@ e@@ wers should now quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border , no more refugees come to Hungary after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before closing on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the overcoming and damage of the gren@@ ades as a crime .
in the southern Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
the convic@@ ted threatened prison sentences up to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were met on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; on Tuesday , almost all - 93 - at the main transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with young children as well as two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees staying there .
practically no one has a view to be granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the expi@@ red asylum seekers should be de@@ ported .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up .
they collected the garbage , leaving tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
shut@@ ters were disman@@ tled and one of the shooting camps in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this transformation .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reached a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
according to government information , the 20,000 migrants were still in the country .
in Salzburg , approximately 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing regularly met smaller groups of refugees on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday , when ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , but for them it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and drew the edge together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we have had the un@@ trusted guests only once , with snack and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers stayed at W@@ els on Sunday evening in W@@ els from a ICE into a regional train towards Passa@@ u , in order to get the announcement that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still trying to try the border .
but the regional train was removed from the border at W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able , on the day before a two @-@ bridge run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more than thousands of thousands to us , is a logical result of an apparent policy :
instead of helping in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp in the construction of structures to ensure human@@ eness , our Chancellor has officially opened up the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guiding these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted in the border regions with chaotic states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poultry will also find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will become a great challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee flows and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for protection seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof districts
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has filled all hands with the refugee support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is accustomed to the fact that his word has weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to impose quot@@ as for thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos at Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &apos;s first opening centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great fuss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Ministry of Interior spoke of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad charged with a demand of 8@@ 5.000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees we can create it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already conducted talks with the provincial capital .
they would have assured him to create quarters even for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ar supports Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations are the asylum coordinator also in the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
private individuals can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
in addition , you are hoping for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in emergency times , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors have to comply with a certain amount of the towel holder or size of the upper light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , in contrast to the Interior Ministry , Konrad founded with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom you don &apos;t say no further into the face of truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause any cost of the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
so far , the own search engine has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees plans the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the parties are currently unable to submit these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of an emergency , however , other locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability .
criticism exer@@ ts the head of the city on the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to contribute their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not blocked &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday confirmed the further action in the refugee issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic is still possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special trains with refugees to Germany will not give it any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the protective seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz Industrial Line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is officially closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is drawn up , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard , and later also to acquire them .
from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - where Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is adapted from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of residual space in the building are already rented , for further 40 percent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened a second store in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the heart of the new shop .
in fact , Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally , she has gained growth in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets have to have 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday , the new shop is in operation .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have thought for a long time if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has placed Br@@ eit from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
for me most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in ge@@ aring , can also not answer the professional woman with the last safety .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag is upgraded every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this property also combines some with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for offset .
whether he expresses himself hostile , journalists , or knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the U.S. Pres@@ idential Office s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate dollar come from .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fris@@ ur is a term for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the Wein@@ straße .
some in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to him about -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt fashion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous offspring , to which in addition to Tru@@ mp also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts there .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp is a bit a big Moor@@ ish , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too high @-@ German : the An@@ ders , says it .
Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate company was first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to the homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian State to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he was once without approval , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen Geschichte und Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is in contrast to the occasionally marked statements of the follow @-@ up .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ ishes , it is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement fores@@ ees the Americans rather distance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so sincere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated a visit to the church organ , which was generally well ank@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine the Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he does not know the choice , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , which was inter@@ viewed for the Tru@@ mp , have seen 12@@ ,000 Kin@@ o@@ uns , also in the United States .
the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the Deutsche Alpen@@ verein , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the neighbouring country is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has no major shifts in the ratings for today .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the German capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull abol@@ ished the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise posted an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five main cities , compared to Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August , an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 went out .
in September Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change concern this morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and struck slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe yiel@@ ded an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 a.m. to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half @-@ hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators achieved a total of 7@@ 20,000 spectators in the second half hour .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollar that failed to over@@ ride Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably unknow@@ ingly revealed who The Bachelor wins .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor , finally lands , was envel@@ oped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we arrived with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before going out of three two , you may accidentally have given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood sealed his lips until the final on Thursday
all three women have settled on ly@@ rical ways why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they might become a player who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki were both quick - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I thought it was in the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on Earth with both feet on earth , it makes so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit was clear last week that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly hired on him , &quot; she said .
and when they were asked who Wood should choose if not they were , it was mysterious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a decision between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 pm .
originally released as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a che@@ ek as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ t at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his lost catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that is now common , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut in 2007 when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free voters demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee figures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
party and Fra@@ c@@ tion@@ ist Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sur in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt in front of a heavy crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there is not a new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get inv@@ a@@ sions in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ tag fraction of the Free voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually , other main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the cl@@ ergy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN security zones for refugees in Syria , as it gave them during Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not going on , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seekers want to push the open voters as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; we need a nationwide standard of federal states . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria postpon@@ es , others do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must become more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy should not fall under the table .
a years of permanent bur@@ ners remain on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; intermediate level plus &quot; in which an extension of the gym@@ nasi@@ al intermediate level of three to four years will be tested - in the result it will take nine years to secondary school .
but that &apos;s not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 needs to be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand freedom of choice for all gym@@ na@@ es who want it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 anywhere , where it is requested .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber floors on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rub@@ ble in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ stret@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , and some of them cast stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said , the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before resor@@ ting to rub@@ ble .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber floors , known to which it is known that they can kill , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , evi@@ dently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent clas@@ hes since the 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal which has been ruled out for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legislature agreed this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could take effect on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city

Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market around 4000 square meters of land in direct neighbourhood to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the site for a mix of trade , commerce and living .

the plans for vacation rental at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented public plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ li@@ eger are further worried - they fear the sale of their leisure activity
for months , behind closed doors had been negotiated , gre@@ ased , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new vacation rental are located at the small seaside near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time in the urban development committee of the Em@@ den Council on Monday evening .
originally , this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , who pre@@ tended to investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inking went to the offensive from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all the ru@@ mo@@ urs .
about ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects have been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among marine land@@ owners who came to the meeting called out the pictures and new details on the desired hotel construction .
Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and member of the Executive Board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a giant kl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
he also fears like some other project critics that the traffic would increase greatly due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; there must be entire bus invitations so that this is reck@@ oned , &quot; says Schulz
what happens exactly on the good one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Google launches dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donations campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who ro@@ b the European nations , as they flee from war @-@ torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis grew in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global accumulated donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / can be doubled to 11 million dollars .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria that has sold more than 4 million people this year .
many fled from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .
reporting of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for easily overweight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity surgery has proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are ill @-@ obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ v@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cers - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I under those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 .
among those undergoing surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes condition was completely dissolved in 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and partly at only about two percent .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood levels of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c fell by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also reported average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rek@@ tomy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent an obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have tied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is currently attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , too popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rü@@ cker readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not take up all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called on to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he demanded that under the given circumstances should the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries is ad@@ mira@@ ble to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 , pointing out that the violent reaction of the USA attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my confession in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of intake of hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
poison control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ lows strong alcoholic beverages , thus the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income from hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the poison control centres report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are becoming more and more frequent in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children do disinf@@ ect@@ ants intentionally drink while some are doing to impress their friends or because of a mutation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be caught by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ umes .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very small children can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation especially for small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t have a si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently taken four sy@@ ringe from straw@@ berry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ants at school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors over@@ woke them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and found his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with death cases .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York scheduled to poison their &quot; gem@@ a &quot; teacher by issuing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; it reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the ver@@ ver@@ ted plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver was easily injured in a collision accident on the cross @-@ gap between the northern border and on Her@@ oes .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove to the round@@ about in the direction of the round@@ about industrial area and was too late at the round@@ about to stop two preceding vehicles .
in the episode , he performed with his truck into the rear of an audi@@ tor and sh@@ ook off this vehicle to a previously standing Ford Fi@@ esta .
in the accident involved vehicles , material damage was about 10 000 Euros , the police force the police .

rum@@ ors : no di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic
Griff@@ i@@ ths is playing the talk of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , Dei@@ la gives that the ho@@ ops stand on a bad place , but that he will turn it again .
Hear@@ ts will fight S@@ FA because of the accus@@ ation of N@@ eil@@ son and be cau@@ tious in January @-@ new obligations which could destroy the unity of the cad@@ res
d@@ ons increase tour via Celtic to five points
Adam Ro@@ one@@ y &apos;s el@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a scar@@ ce victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the d@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here not only talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now stands at the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had already bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly so - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the player better .
now there is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously in January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago that he pointed out that he took some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing new entran@@ ces and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the On@@ eness of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
players who come in the summer have this season time to integrate what you saw with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic destination Mich@@ u with back @-@ back reference
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome ank@@ le for two years and has not managed the departure from Wales in this summer .
Hear@@ ts set to S@@ FA battle due to N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was later lifted - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no power commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the un@@ improved Hi@@ bee was instructed after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the stor@@ mer , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is certainly to say that I will not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it does not play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee &apos;s Executive Board has confidence in the management team to turn things - but it is said that the decline in the field must end .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ ben , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is glad to win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ beautiful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen was desper@@ ately struggling against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to win a seventh consecutive league win , which gave them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic on the upper edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ y El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no team that won all , in poker games or Li@@ gen , the games of this kind also won &apos;t have won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it is in the United Kingdom overall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period of May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom was up 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Schot@@ t@@ land unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the figure of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau for National Statisti@@ cs ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken disturbed the exp@@ ir@@ ation
because the security personnel could not meet the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray , the officials could take the stur@@ geon into custody .
a breath @-@ alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.@@ 89 pro@@ mil@@ le .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 Pro@@ mil@@ le and initially remained in custody .
why I will be witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew closer , I began to fear me .
so why should I do it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications than places available , a lean lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots of 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emotion@@ ally .
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone numbers and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it and you will get access .
I compla@@ ined about her .
they admitted that &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have done .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of deed .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
I think there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters that you can turn to .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after a damp police chase is persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman stayed dry when he talked to the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the bank . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was sum@@ mon@@ ed to a house peace break in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman acts . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
master football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ches to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he quoted the Ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for the race sport and he himself found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobal@@ t pup@@ il test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had returned 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know it went on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will go home tonight and sleep well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want to walk through the head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had tried the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; ten months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I am asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they obviously believe that I am a frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they have failed to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , the current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the opinion that it is personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave well and maybe people outside of trainers are responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am it .
perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will exercise the pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the train@@ ee &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have built up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ slaugh@@ tered Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has mistakenly applied mud to the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day , which was so .
but it was so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here it is too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals due to alle@@ gations about ring fights
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda setting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; Ring@@ struggles &quot; with his team during the high performance in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed note to the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers at his team is confident that they were worried that they were worried to be defeated by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is happening again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring struggles when she struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we did not change anything in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and that has provided us the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny how this occurs again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a sh@@ utter .
but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play them .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to have to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is it an exciting game ?
or are breaks doing and do not have any points of tension ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm team is free to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will start from next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drug delivery
a man , possibly a lifel@@ ong punishment due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that was smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America over Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for trying to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c ar@@ gues that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of flight at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of a criminal affair , he lied to the police about his place of residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the ei@@ vable declarations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports on the police daily and stops at a starting block of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : cab breaks apart
with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left to the left , as the police told .
the driver &apos;s cab is completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed over six hours to 2 pm .
there was a damage to the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to the sending of pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the telephone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the phone of the girl when she was asleep , log@@ ged in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and aler@@ ted her mother immediately .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; Web research , the concepts for the search for in@@ decent pictures of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed that he did it as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ edi@@ ophi@@ le on the internet , &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an addiction to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was happening because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did so to l@@ ure them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he would then see pictures of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the defend@@ ant used computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , found guilty in the sense of the indictment , in@@ decent pictures of children on the 14th of June last year , on 25 January of this year to have viol@@ ated the conditions and not to be published before a hearing on 24 March this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , since one could argue that &quot; there is no significant sexual element &quot; in his transgres@@ sion .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el conf@@ ers the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was admitted in this case , but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings in other cases .
he was still admitted before the date of the sentence into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
slu@@ gs turn on small border transitions to Germany
more and more refugees are picked up off the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many Schle@@ users left out of fear of discovery and arrest the people increasingly on smaller border transitions
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
along the border river Inn , Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn have been attacked more than 1,000 refugees since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and dam@@ pers to the German side .
there they are received by federal police in reception and for@@ warded to registration .
at the Munich main station , according to federal police data , more refugees met again on Wednesday at the beginning of the week .
around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 AM , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , the city reached 17@@ 59 refugees on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : footh@@ ills of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest expected
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful bass is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drop@@ let , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days from the Bermuda Islands to the Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , it is still up to Thursday morning in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground @-@ sea circle with bu@@ cks from 60 to 90 km kilometres .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again .
the mass makes it : every two years , the cars show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
2015 is particularly popular with the compact car , which is currently particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for by the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment .
this is reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available in autumn by the dealers .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Rüssel@@ sheim . Opel introduces a step ahead of the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , which starts at € 17 650 .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only a five @-@ door model .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will be done next to the Astra at the Frankfurt Motor Show ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitors Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only five @-@ door in a conventional and an under@@ stated sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes next year , then also as a com@@ bo .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ publisher wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
according to manufacturer &apos;s information , the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) .
launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is visible at the IAA .
on the outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers first laid hands on the front part : here the radiator grill was reis@@ su@@ ed and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the new Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are human un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court granted an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the Te@@ gel Justice Unit , which was accommod@@ ated in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
the persons affected may even hope for the judges if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on the free foot , moved into a larger cell .
due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the land of Berlin , his detention centre failed .
however , the Constitutional Court took up the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and transferred the case to the re @-@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even though for legal reasons , only a few days of detention for compensation is decisive for compensation , it was said that it was a balancing act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a disgu@@ sting of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
thus they said only in April a prisoner of damages , because he was imprisoned in a cell naked in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is according to a decision by 2011 , according to the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , in addition to Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed a decent accommodation in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated every day between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
in the last few weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had also come to the head@@ lines because of missing personnel .
for this reason , prisoners are always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to pun@@ ches , it should have come to the ten@@ se situation .
according to the judicial authorities , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of young men , 19 shall be taken away from the end of 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Interior this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create that and we create that . &quot;
what comes to Germany is the following overview .
according to different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) Apartments are needed annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all in affordable rental properties : every year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments come out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favourable homes , refugees will also apply .
for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing needs to be created every year and the federal government would have to invest a funding amoun@@ ting to 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
scientists and federal ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
according to the Institute for Employment Research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says Migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political shift in Germany : from the prohibition of employment to refugees for recognition of work .
while there was earlier a ban on asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation , the asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in society , even because of the shortage of skilled workers , the view has been established in several ways that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster .
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lack of German knowledge .
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most common by personal contacts .
the development of networks is therefore according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt &apos;s view of the Königs@@ weg to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fle@@ dged parents give their children to Kit@@ as , estimated at least ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ren@@ ched parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration .
in order to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ books in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators to rise sharply through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase education capacity - for example by allowing more technical schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for classes without knowledge of German .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ases from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state forbi@@ ds asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) but now abandoned its position .
student willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated by access to the university .
for refugees with a resi@@ dency or Dul@@ ce do not receive services after the asylum application law more if they start studying .
the latter generally does not get a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g since it does not fall under the circle of the vulnerable people .
tolerated refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ entitled , from January 1 , 2016 to shor@@ ten this gap to 15 months .
but this financing gap has to be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play an important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually contem@@ plate the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches right to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it would also be important for the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers .
the rights also belong to the rights .
thus , the representative of Islam must agree with a clear contact person and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give him certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to take action against religious fundament@@ alism .
the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to do such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more urgent .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency since a decade and a general equality law .
but it is slowly learning how the NS@@ U mur@@ ders showed that the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive systematically .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organizations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany must become reality in the next few years , if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is capable of providing medical care to the previously expected refugees , &quot; says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what concerns man@@ - power and capacities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery ur@@ ges to susp@@ end all newcom@@ ers at the registration of health tickets .
services could be calculated later with the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to send so many people with the limited power catalog , which fores@@ ees the asylum application law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise the doctors mainly make language barriers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even so far , the Berlin Health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are worse over their illnesses than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ters need to be taken over .
many refugees were also helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
for example , there are much more untreated disabilities in refugee camps , and among the young people it is about HIV enligh@@ tenment .
with some of the other diseases German doctors come from their training but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees may even allevi@@ ate allevi@@ ation in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have had a highly developed education system , some refugees even have doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therapy Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
in particular , refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study at the University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with breathing difficulties , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ burn and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong sh@@ rou@@ gh@@ ness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms being chronic , early treatment is necessary , says Mun@@ z .
up to now , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
while mentally ill seekers in the social offices can provide an application for psycho@@ therapy , the processing usually takes several months .
in addition , doctors or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses would decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes back to the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on the brick .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current management stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the Cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift to the lovers lies the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to take away people from their everyday life and take them to another world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cocktail cocktail with world city flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , it wants to loose the Cuban duo loose .
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger@@ tips and articul@@ ation .
balance the wheel on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake @-@ men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascinated with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; if our animals are not good , it is not good for us . &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
the four @-@ leg@@ ged artists , as they are called lovingly , will be read by the eyes upon the possibility of each wish .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the Man@@ ege .
so the top commandment : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mix of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y and a zeb@@ ra stu@@ b , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
so for every visitor , something is likely to be part of it .
&quot; one thing is safe , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances from 17 to 20 September every day .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 and 16 o &apos;clock .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are dis@@ counted .
the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also conf@@ essed by the asser@@ tions of members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ inger .
last month , they had booked him out and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the State in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones who warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ it &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the affected Parliament members that the immunity ends in parliament , and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service activities .
expected job cuts lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who will guide the unit after separation .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before , to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; thus an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical installations and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation proceeds to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain at the European Championship .
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury threat@@ ens not the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical perspective , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation by Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a period of time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career that he deserves .
Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to give a small break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al are clear favor@@ ites to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , whereby the judge scale 3.@@ 2 was measured .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco , and is driven by far hope to lead the club to his first European apo@@ calyp@@ se triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked out at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and three times more frequent in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a heredi@@ tary life ) 2015 was announced as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to cope with this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the body had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not depres@@ sive , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication guided by social media , with its focus on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , lifel@@ ong and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health far more profound .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focusing was put on the head .
every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which shines through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when football matches in cosy arm@@ chairs and the y@@ earning of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to each case even if they often with@@ hold back completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and com@@ promised , has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old speech &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; friends is one of the shows that come to me in the sense when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it presents clearly the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the newly designed backdrop to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or even better if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning until the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as a PS@@ G player who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally reached their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and S@@ haft Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris also needs a strong start against Swedish masters , as it does not only seek the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities before the gate . he became later in play against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents &quot; problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we need to perfect during the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not yet have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that last weekend a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ mer was called the man who has taken PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he entered into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he graduated from Johan Wil@@ and beautiful into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle of the middle ranks a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave herself up , with some mis@@ ses and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was at no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the restart .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c that Di Maria turned into a shot which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an was thus the sixth season of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had found a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result was low before replacement players E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi had been recognized at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champion league game was in December last year .
since then we have played only in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games aren &apos;t enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
the mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , based in Switzerland , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday , collected $ 2.5 billion by a stock selling as part of his huge school student plan .
the company Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , said that it has sold new shares worth $ 1.6 billion to pay its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value in this year , is struggling with falling raw material prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented from change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern obviously stood before the obligation of Spain Super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona at that time .

in summer the meanwhile 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now betra@@ ys that he stood before the Euro 2008 before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won everything , we do nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered version of the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has taken me away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , out@@ dated the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ mined the need for alternative perspectives and in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not during the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the act@@ ress of The Mar@@ tian settled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer of Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the character of the Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a nun , who is beaten by her white sugar .
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film . Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that is SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 returns and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement of Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide effects and urged law@@ makers and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against colour content .
in February , the singer Prince made a recording to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album quietly matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation and as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be viewed as a group of hatred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already taken the Pope , is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport climbing and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of 1 million dollars home .
the competition show , which had just completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , which was able to complete all steps of its obstacle course .
during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Camer@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
for the last task , climbing on a 75 feet long climbing rope was included in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of the winning of the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deserved more than 10,000 $ or had to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished the course at all , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than a fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has a p@@ enny about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
he received the masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or has been extended for a light season that will start filming in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to ascend within one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros game for the second American League Wild@@ card .
for Detroit , albeit only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so hard to write about a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner and enabled three rows .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen any game , and therefore I want to go into the game very concentrated .
the designated tiger eye Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has taken the Schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the background at the end of the seventh inner , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran wall , the only man faced with whom he was confronted , before the designed R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ run escape .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was that in the Major League leading 27 times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe suggested a double play
after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inside , the Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ lose of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right handed down S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited at the start of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three rounds in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been kn@@ itted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after having been missing more than a month because of a spinal cord .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started to get rid of some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ands gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the runner in the scor@@ ing position .
the third ba@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed by a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not hit particularly well , but he caught the right place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , did not score points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the Reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired because of a violation of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder cut , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is kn@@ itted from the vulner@@ ability list to launch the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tiger since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he was missing in the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees should be signed in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in Wiesbaden should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden shared on Tuesday evening .
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily suspended .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days , there were 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse after the initial recording of the presi@@ dency of the presi@@ ding presi@@ dency of Gie@@ ßen .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have established emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the great number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he threw the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective way@@ marks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was glad that the Kel@@ ch had passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict comes crashing in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid on the spot for the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner announced on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , after Hungary no one was sent back .
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could take a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the General Director of Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call for concrete figures and pointed out talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come across the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ Route from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , requested a special summit for next week .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries with the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined the people who would need protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead , you can &apos;t stay in Germany too .
this view was strongly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now handle a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge power effort &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia on Tuesday .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to lock the border with Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent tow@@ ing smu@@ g@@ gling over Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new Gren@@ zz@@ au@@ n .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , for example , e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported thousands of further migrants on the way to the Greek border .
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the bay of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean s@@ wore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , the moon stag@@ gered slightly on his way around the ring plan@@ ks .
this num@@ eric movement is only small but still too large for a permanently solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers presented their analyses in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
in 2006 , Cass@@ ini had discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es on the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ ying water vap@@ or and ice particles and feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn .
at least on the South Pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
the 1860 Munich must refrain from spending a month on the offensive Val@@ det R@@ ama .
an examination showed an ad@@ duc@@ tor failure in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , divided by the association .
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich &apos;s lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport@@ director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a look at the possible obligation of a unified professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , the Six@@ ties presented a defensive man initially .

whoever eats the fruits , thus supports vision , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too solid and smell pleasant .
the shell color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ gos can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and are consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special note .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some bl@@ at@@ ts@@ al@@ ates like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first f@@ ading tower , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps of the F@@ öhn breaks through , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland , on Tuesday .
on Wedn@@ es@@ days and in the night to Thursday , the hair @-@ dryer is partly blowing with storm strength by the F@@ öhn@@ t@@ valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front that brings powerful ra@@ ins , wind bu@@ cks and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ print area across the British islands in a powerful south @-@ west stream .
on the alpine side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn breaks through the valleys during the night .
in the episode , the F@@ öhn blows up to Thursday morning in the wil@@ lows with bu@@ cks of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can reach out to the adjacent middle of the center , and even can@@ oes of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair @-@ dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , humidity begins to st@@ ow on the mountain slope .
here is the rain , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , south of the Alps must be counted in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , which after the last few days , great rainf@@ alls have already fallen .
on Thursday morning , the F@@ öhn winds the air , in the episode rolled a cold front with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east across Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind refresh@@ es strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures are clearly back .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the weekend it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Reform@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the Evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live in secret their faith over centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic manner , the place will become visible in a symbolic manner that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a perfect sin@@ ner ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions might have led him to the view of historians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the decline in the evening .
hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updates Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with magnificent pictures .
at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is not equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , it can be quite glo@@ omy .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked in his Bible project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles which focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ therhood .
with this he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : this is true for the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is based on painting with the respective scrip@@ tures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he interpre@@ ts the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus translated into current contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible study of Martin Luther and each one of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus , the 75 year old has twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education was once again with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ember Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work with the Lord , perhaps again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to bring more importance to art in a faster time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is marked by advertising today , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and joy to show things .
pictures always have a bit of sec@@ rec@@ y and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to fall into the images , &quot; let them look , discover and feel what strength they have : &quot; the picture looks for his counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday with the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
old did not pay attention to the Bible to be fully compreh@@ ended , but also selected for him , also mysterious themes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the images , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X rail
plans made , space found , company mand@@ ated to model Erd@@ hü@@ gel for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X rail was already finished .
par@@ ables in politics and administration ensured dr@@ ink@@ age , especially among the residents who would not tolerate the railway .
so hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will take place in October , the First municipal council Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees from 2019 to 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend .
the football is responding to the situation in Germany and ass@@ ures politics its help in cop@@ ing with the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can no one say in principle , that &apos;s nothing to do , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting to everyone to get this issue in the handle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet there the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could and would help .
but the decisive course has to put politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore the German football team has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach explained at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 pros put a clear sign if they are on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the impression &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ chief Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes everyone , no one can see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; League of League &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the European Championships against Hungary on this Friday , the National Team of the Women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license agreements have started in their own projects , be great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent spent in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees in cooperation with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP Management Board loses an eye for an accident
the head of the Executive Board of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost blood@@ thir@@ sty , then went out to the street - that he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early October , we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full of SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I stood all the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus vs Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes of a com@@ eback made by Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the European League will definitely be broken .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the football league in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left : &quot; we reck@@ on with a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high burden of his professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change his pedi@@ gree to the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ keeper position .
for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of tribal party Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained at an absolute top level &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in the future in all European league games , Tu@@ chel left open .
with a high probability , he will also play the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ sche statement by fellow players R@@ eus that the final suit for the B@@ V@@ B in the European League must be the goal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to take the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants a pioneering role for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany shall be a pioneer in the transformation of the car technology .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA from a &quot; new mobility age . &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states that come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport under@@ scores the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a high rise in digital radio radio .
a test track at the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks arise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to make sure that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which only fores@@ ees people as a driver .
in automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver gets more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inexperienced vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the Germany site appreciate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the truck can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD traffic policy S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still see scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA @-@ proposed survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ator Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 per cent do not believe in all at all .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine cabinet : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , among others , with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say today that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om Bürger@@ stei@@ g on the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ whose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed complete artwork for which much effort was carried out : to fr@@ ise the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired .
14 tons of material have incar@@ n@@ ated the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special feature : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy is also visible in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ingly fashionable side@@ walks of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
the dra@@ fting of fashion he later brought himself to himself .
he ste@@ ered fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
but later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing but they were allowed to keep clothes .
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as fashion niche
in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , which they used for example in blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ j@@ okes P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the beginning times of the P@@ lau@@ ener tip fashion played a major role , was then pushed through the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and at regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past stit@@ ches , represents an increasing order potential .
anyone who uses no niche in the textile industry is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ j@@ okes P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener lace and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the last 15 years , some 80 percent of the turnover declined .
there are almost no more private business transactions and also the wholesale trade .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
today , the bulk goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region , and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
it also weak@@ ens export , currently to Russia and in the United States .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the nitrogen bead in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger Exter@@ enst@@ elle of the West@@ Saxon University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that needs time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that need to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly different to keep a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ covers the historic snow tip .
at the same time , the machine sticks small chi@@ cks in some places .
the P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ed Championship in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; I couldn &apos;t start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener tip - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and the surrounding area and who would like to share a souvenir .
so I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener tip .

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open wider to the outside to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the steering of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new start @-@ ups and promoting reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , said Xi .
the leadership group adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list for the regulation of the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the residents reporting system .
according to the statement , a negative list is created , which identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments .
the system is tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance as it indicates the market a major role in allocation of resources , ensuring a legally state business environment and is open to the market , said the statement .
the government will also enti@@ ce control over the powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how they manage their business .
the statement also said that China border regions will enable new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open state controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the right of lawyers to exercise their activity and use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .

EU wants to double mercury @-@ limit value in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Consumer Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who has received a corresponding work paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans sharply : &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish should be raised at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m of fish .
however , large predat@@ ors are already so strongly bur@@ dened with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ compatible .
in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values in other fish from 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ fishes , such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they keep the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction that alone helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal for the human being , which is strongly enrich@@ ing over the food chain above all in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small quantities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage in terms of the current maximum values , but that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cannot be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal burning in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations meet Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lasting and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had quoted &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been one of the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
