&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied when conducting the provisions of Part I on preventive measures .
the objective of the procedures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of the de@@ bit@@ ing of significant amounts of nuclear activities for nuclear weapons and other nuclear activities for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ rence from such a breakdown by the risk of premature discovery .
in order to reach the goal established in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a safeguard measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial input and observation as important complementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the examination by the organisation is carried out by an explanation , in which the quantity of material not specified for a certain period of time is specified , stating the accuracy limits for the specified ranges .
in carrying out its investigations , the organisation after Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community .
the accoun@@ t@@ ancy and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of their security measures , the Community shall make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , demonstrate how they are intended and useful in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and stock quantities ;
( B ) the assessment of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for the determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for assessing the accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory and the changes in this stock , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone , for each material balance zone ;
( g ) make sure the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures in accordance with this Convention are not extended to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which the phase of the nuclear fuel circuit described below ( c ) has not yet been reached , is introduced into the states , so that the organization of the organization divi@@ des the quantity and composition of the material unless it is in@@ stituted for non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves nuclear material , which is suitable for composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope accumulation , plant or process phase in which it is manufactured , or is inserted into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circuit , so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The provisions envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not gro@@ unded , the association is , for the time being , not possible or desirable from resi@@ dues , so the organization and community should consult each other on the application of appropriate safegu@@ ards .
B ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community assume that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
upon request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures following this agreement :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
upon request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es core material , which would otherwise be subject to hed@@ ging measures under this agreement , of these security measures , provided that the total material quantity liberated by this article in the states is at no point in any time than
a ) a total of one kilogra@@ m of special material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Uran@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment , which lies under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of Natur@@ a , calcul@@ ates by the multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or underneath ;
if liberated core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the security measures under this Convention , precau@@ tions are made for re @-@ use of the backup measures on that material .
the community meets with the organization of complementary agreements , which are required in the scope , which is required for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the Organisation according to this Convention , in detail how to apply the procedures laid down in the Convention .
the supplementary agreements can be expanded or altered without any change in the agreement between the organization and the community .
the comple@@ xi@@ ties of this agreement come into force at the same time or as soon as possible after the entry into force . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to force these agreements within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the understanding between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report outlined in Article 62 , the organization provides a summ@@ arized inventory of the whole , the security measures underlying this agreement in the States , irrespective of its origin , and continues this inventory based on the subsequent reports and results of its investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource @-@ related problems .
C ) The purpose of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC Organisation has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -
the organization speci@@ fies a special account under the name &quot; Special Account &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this Agreement ( in this capacity , the organization is referred to as &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment takes place in the form of cash or in@@ significant deb@@ its of the Member State , which are payable upon request in the currency of the respective state to order the organization as administrator of the transaction account and to be deposited at the Agency &apos;s Agency &apos;s Agency in the country concerned .
B ) Payment will be made in two inst@@ al@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution shall be within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker at the agreed time ;
II ) The second in the amount of the remaining amount to 1 January 1979 or at another date agreed between the E@@ EC and the bai@@ li@@ ff taking into account the periods required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget@@ ary plans .
C ) Every Member State may , upon request , make payments before the above dates .
according to the organisation &apos;s usual procedures , the administrator takes about proportional drawing on the cash or the school notes in order to cover expenses for the transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account appropriately .
in the granting of these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the E@@ EC :
to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional credit default capacity to loan terms without dis@@ counting ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each transaction loan is designed to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ ectable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral program ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered for the proper funding of the organization .
the funds of the special transaction may not be used instead of ordinary funding from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or of the organization which is bound by a loan or loan for a program or purpose which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entry into force .
apart from section 4 , transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms which apply to the development loans granted by the organization ; they are thus re@@ payable in 50 years each time .
transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies .
amounts to pay this fee must be paid directly to the organization that it retains .
each transaction loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular .
the revenues from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured or provided in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which may be the recipient of a transaction loan at the time of the loan guarantee .
capital re@@ payments of special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in this way in the currency of a Member State is to be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
until the full awar@@ ding of all transaction loans , the bai@@ li@@ ff teaches the E@@ EC of the purposes and programmes approved by the directors regarding the examination by the directors .
during the time of re@@ payment of the transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker informs the E@@ EC four times a year on the development of the transaction loan and the expenses incurred for this .
the car@@ et@@ aker transm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the transaction accounts with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization at this account end .
after full payment of the transaction loan , the manager of the E@@ EC promptly transfers a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account .
the administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid from the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are apparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ EC and the administrators are working closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to do so , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator through to the complete edition of the means of the Special Trans@@ action Account from time to time carry out an exchange of ideas on the state of the special transaction account , the progress of the programs or projects financed by special transaction fees and all other questions concerning the provisions of this Agreement .
if this agreement has not come into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , if the E@@ EC and the organization may agree , the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from shall be invalid with immediate effect .
if the total amount of funds paid by the bene@@ fici@@ aries is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and referred back to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States are not@@ ing the conclusion of the proceedings to the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities .
the Sec@@ retariat passes these noti@@ fications together with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this Agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organisation .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month that follows the day of entry of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two papers in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with every word spoken equally authentic .

with the same objective Eur@@ atom is concerned that with the time of the entry into force of the present agreement , Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot;
with regard to the JET &apos;s participation in the JET , Switzerland will be a member of the Joint Venture JET , which accepts its stat@@ ute at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement .
Eur@@ atom also cares for Switzerland to become a partner of any contract whose goal falls within the scope of the present agreement , excluding association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with the implementation of the Association envis@@ aged in Article 2 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
the association agreement , in particular , fores@@ ees the suspension of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor and manage the development of the research work so that the best possible results are achieved in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme - in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning current or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , carries out this task with regard to all research and development activities relating to this agreement .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and al@@ ig@@ ns their T * activities in the interests of the two contracting parties on the common goal established in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss program , as well as on the scientific and technological developments in the world .
in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the competent Swiss authorities ask .
the Advisory Groups , which submit to the VG research proposals for the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom programme , fulfil this task with regard to all research and development work relating to this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories as part of the Eur@@ atom programme .

if such a further program decision succ@@ eeds , the extension for the duration of the new programme will apply , which will take place in the position of the Eur@@ atom programme listed in App@@ endi@@ x I . this agreement is considered not to be terminated if only delays occur during the adoption of another Eur@@ atom programme .
before each decision on the adoption of a new Eur@@ atom programme , the contracting parties refer to articles 5 to 10 and articles 16 of the above @-@ mentioned bodies .
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement at any time , subject to a period of six months .
in the form of a letter to change the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
in addition to simpli@@ fying the procedure for the adjustment of customs tari@@ ff terms in the event of renewed changes to the customs tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , it will also appear to include an article 12 to the agreement .
I am pleased to give you the consent of the Community to these changes and suggest you as an appointment for the entry into force on 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the above .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your current letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of Member States &apos; demands as part of medium @-@ term financial support
the BI@@ S could close Stand@@ by credit agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding application .
the agreements could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor land to the mechanism , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion Ac@@ counting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , which the BI@@ S would be willing to use .
in each stand @-@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions , but without a total of five years being exceeded .
in the event of the opening of the credits and the extension of the loan , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first dra@@ fts will not be made before the end of a month after the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the dra@@ fts would take place in the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement at the available currency , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be negotiated in consideration of the funds of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those transactions carried out by the BI@@ S at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would correspond largely to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S must obtain the necessary funds themselves on the market , then the interest rate applicable to the application might reach a maximum that corresponds to a corresponding margin increase .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
I am referring to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations regarding the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community .
- fresh or ch@@ illed h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina following the community are set to the following yearly amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina agrees to ensure that the annual amount actually did not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to the traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee referred to under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community is entitled to the protection clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access of Argentina to the community market has not been touched upon this agreement .

in particular , the community applies precau@@ tions , so that the sale of stocks of frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the conduct of the regulation governing the sales of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of funds or other funding measures for the export of lamb and lamb as well as slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lamb will only be given at prices and conditions that are consistent with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of community in world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ to and Trade Agreement .
Argentina , in particular , ass@@ ures compliance with this agreement , in particular , that there are export licenses set out in this agreement for the products named under the number 1 .
the Community obli@@ ges itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina depends on the presentation of an export license , which is designated by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ inian government .

the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goats are carried out under the agreement of non @-@ named tari@@ ff numbers after the community .
the committee will discuss all the questions arising in carrying out this agreement and recommends suitable solutions to the competent authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the provisions of this agreement will apply irrespective of the rights and obligations of the parties under the G@@ AT@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a deadline of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 , with regard to changes which they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would share with your government the approval of your government .
I honour me to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Republic of the East of Uruguay about trading with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
I am referring to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations regarding the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goats from Uruguay to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community .
- fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( Tari@@ ff Authority 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Custom@@ s Tari@@ ff ;
- Fro@@ zen poultry , lamb and goat meat ( Tari@@ ff Authority 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Custom@@ s Tari@@ ff .
within the framework of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set to the following yearly volume :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay has committed itself to ensuring that the actual annual amount does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out in accordance with the traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee referred to under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community is entitled to the protection clause , it ple@@ dges to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an access to the Community market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that imports from Uruguay are exceeding the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the Community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of products collected by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the community in consultation with Uruguay changes the amount specified under number 2 according to the scope of Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import duties for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; in this case , the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ rate of exhaus@@ tion shall be taken into account .
with the date of accession of Greece to the community , the total amount mentioned under number 2 is set to 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development which could imp@@ air the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ bs on the common market within agreed quantities .
in particular , the community applies precau@@ tions , so that the sale of stocks of frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the conduct of the regulation on the sale of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ish she@@ ep@@ skin .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of funds or other funding measures for the export of lamb and lamb as well as slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lamb will only be given at prices and conditions that are consistent with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of community in world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ to and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay guarantees the compliance with this agreement , in particular , that there are export licenses set out in this agreement for the products named under the number 1 .
the Community obli@@ ges itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in Uruguay is dependent on the presentation of an export license , which is designated by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in terms of implementing provisions , the relevant ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an authority in the competent authority of the Community regul@@ ates in regular intervals the quantities issued for export licenses ; these data may , if necessary , en@@ code according to destination country .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other hand .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a deadline of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government with this letter .

whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community the obligation to grant this release falls into the jurisdiction of the community based on the treaty by which it was founded , which has the required powers to do so ;
whereas it is necessary for the implementation of Article 5 ( 1 of the Convention ) that the European Economic Community may become a contracting party of the Convention -
the Convention enters into force for the community on the first day of the month following the signature .
it comes into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day when the last of the contracting parties deposited their acceptance certificate with the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
( 2 ) At the end of two years , however , this additional protocol appears in force to which it has been accepted for acceptance , unless one of the contracting parties has notified an objection to its entry into force .
from that point onwards , a state cannot become a contracting party of the convention without becoming a party party of the additional protocol .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , all states and the European Economic Community in accordance with article 2 and the time of entry into force of this additional protocol in accordance with Article 2 .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or any other substance on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
by continuously dil@@ uting the re@@ agent to be investigated , the ti@@ ter is measured on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the re@@ zi@@ pro@@ ke value of the strongest serum fer@@ til@@ iser in which a reaction occurs ; dil@@ uting is calculated solely by volume of the blood cell in@@ und@@ ations in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carrier , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has defined international standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the determination of blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are developed at present .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for the determination of blood group determination of most species is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ist , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ des in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ und@@ ations .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as incomplete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the Tit@@ ration of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International standard preparation or a state standard preparation in international units ( See Bul@@ letin Who O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain , according to definition , 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative tit@@ ration of the international standard serum anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain intact for at least one year .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agent in a flu@@ oric form , according to label , is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of durability tests ; it must be approved by the state regul@@ ators .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may only lose 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ orous pent@@ oxy@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the sol@@ vents delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) is an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to provide the prerequis@@ ites for specific@@ ity and efficacy .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein @-@ nitrogen per ml of fluid or re@@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re@@ activation , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for the international exchange of certain re@@ agents for the determination of blood group determination should not be arti@@ ficially colored , at least until an International Convention has come into being over a unified system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity contained in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records on all stages of production and controls of re@@ agents for the determination of blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents are to be stored for a long time from the laboratory until a certain probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used to determine blood type can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective interest in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin only contain substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
a black on white printed label can be attached to every single container in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ activation ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the use instructions attached to the container must contain the following details : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the amount or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ activation ,
each shipment must be issued a certificate according to Article 4 of the Convention according to the Anne@@ x to this Protocol .
anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of selected individuals of group B , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of the group A .
anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain A an@@ tigen , i.e. those of group A and AB including sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B . there are no human red blood cells that do not contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and B .

anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain ag@@ glut@@ ingu@@ inal A and / or B , i.e. those of the group A including sub@@ groups A1 and A2 of the group B and the group AB including sub@@ groups A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated not human red blood cells that do not contain ag@@ glut@@ ingu@@ inal A or B , i.e. those of the group 0 .
it ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are generally not ag@@ glut@@ inated by blood don@@ ors in group B ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding par@@ ative , separated from A1 and A2 blood cells .
furthermore , it is parallel to the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group serum or an appropriate comparison tool against an in@@ und@@ ating of B @-@ blood cells .
the effectiveness of the serum must in no case be less than 64 international units per ml .
un@@ dil@@ uted Anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause an ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x group ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 % vit@@ rec@@ lam@@ ations of A1 and A2 blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required when the same attempts are carried out with the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group serum or with a standard preparation of equal activity .

anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera of each specific@@ ity can belong to one of two species , which differ from the conditions under which a ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olo@@ ger blood cells is achieved .
with others referred to as &quot; incomplete , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as beef @-@ alb@@ um@@ in or with the help of other special methods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ inate hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells that are washed up in their own serum or plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following requirements for the efficacy of Ser@@ a for the determination of the R@@ h group are possibly to change if international standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immune to the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 over C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9 % sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) serum or a corresponding comparison tool compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the serum should react with blood cells containing do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which may be used to use object bear@@ ers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people , which are immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen .
these Ser@@ a are therefore specific for the C an@@ tigen only when the tested blood cells are washed up in a 0.@@ 9 % sal@@ ine solution .
the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C serum ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ dee @-@ blood cells .
anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended to be used on object bear@@ ers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and do not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immune to the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended to be used on object bear@@ ers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and in any form anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised individuals or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer .
if a serum for use on object bear@@ ers is determined according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time should not be lower in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , than with the proportion@@ ate antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is derived from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain A an@@ tigen ; that is those of the blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it does not glut@@ eal any human red blood cells that contain no A @-@ an@@ tigen ; that is those of the blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group serum or an appropriate comparison tool , separated with floo@@ ding of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2@@ B red blood cells ( 1 ) .
if anti @-@ A serum is bl@@ ended on an object carrier with an equal amount of 1 , 2 and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur in any floo@@ ding within the double time required if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group serum or a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ B serum is derived from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood type B .
anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain B an@@ tigen ; i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; it does not glut@@ eal any human red blood cells that contain no B an@@ tigen ; that is those of blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group serum or an appropriate comparison tool , with an in@@ und@@ ating of blood cells in group B to mark ( 1 ) .
if anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % fl@@ ushing of B @-@ blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ Human @-@ Glob@@ ulin @-@ serum for use in blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is derived from the blood of animals that are immun@@ ised by inj@@ ections of human serum proteins .
if it is used according to the manufacturer &apos;s prescription , there are no un@@ loaded human red blood cells , no matter which blood type they belong to .
