<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the organization have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bindings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the EEC Organisation has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization specifies a special account under the name "Special Account" which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this Agreement (in this capacity, the organization is referred to as "caretaker"), only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is managed separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment takes place in the form of cash or insignificant debits of the Member State, which are payable upon request in the currency of the respective state to order the organization as administrator of the transaction account and to be deposited at the Agency's Agency's Agency in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) Payment will be made in two instalments (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution shall be within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the caretaker at the agreed time;</seg>

<seg id="739">C) Every Member State may, upon request, make payments before the above dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the organisation's usual procedures, the administrator takes about proportional drawing on the cash or the school notes in order to cover expenses for the transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the granting of these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">To the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its additional credit default capacity to loan terms without discounting; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each transaction loan is designed to finance a clearly defined and rapidly expectable development program or project (including a sectoral program), regardless of whether it is part of the organization's loan programme or not, according to the procedures and practices that are considered for the proper funding of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction may not be used instead of ordinary funding from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or of the organization which is bound by a loan or loan for a program or purpose which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entry into force.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from section 4, transaction loans are subject to the same repayment terms which apply to the development loans granted by the organization; they are thus repayable in 50 years each time.</seg>
<seg id="748">Transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are repayable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts to pay this fee must be paid directly to the organization that it retains.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each transaction loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">The revenues from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured or provided in a member state; ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which may be the recipient of a transaction loan at the time of the loan guarantee.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account, and the amount paid back in this way in the currency of a Member State is to be remitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until the full awarding of all transaction loans, the bailiff teaches the EEC of the purposes and programmes approved by the directors regarding the examination by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of repayment of the transaction loan, the caretaker informs the EEC four times a year on the development of the transaction loan and the expenses incurred for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The caretaker transmits the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the transaction accounts with an opinion of the external auditors of the organization at this account end.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the transaction loan, the manager of the EEC promptly transfers a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid from the account and the repayments to the Member States are apparent.</seg>
