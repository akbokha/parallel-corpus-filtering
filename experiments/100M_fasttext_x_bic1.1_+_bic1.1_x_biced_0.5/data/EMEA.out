this document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you require further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of enam@@ el tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for inhal@@ ation ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ elessly thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things which are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder whereby the patient may have varying periods of abnormal mood alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal atmosphere .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ b@@ ance if oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution for taking or the enam@@ el tablets can be used in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this interfer@@ es with the transmission of signals between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be primarily a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l helps to norm@@ alize brain activity , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their re@@ occurring .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to a year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients in whom the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest with which of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to intake .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients receiving Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms than the patients receiving placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
for up to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented placebo reg@@ ain@@ ing man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled so@@ cks ) , nausea ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , nausea , vom@@ iting , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( increased sali@@ va production ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes responded to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were out@@ weighed against the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
June 2004 the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes responded to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy of doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results from an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased suicide risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , conduc@@ tion disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including active and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , occasional reports were reported during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy should be considered to reduce the dose or to break down treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
there was , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and addressing for un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there is no exact risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ tic , poly@@ ur@@ ry , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to comb@@ ating di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with superior side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and should therefore be carried out similar dose reductions .
for C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ isation .
considering the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ P inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and should therefore be carried out similar dose reductions .
after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected to increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used during pregnancy due to the lack of data for safety in humans and due to the concerns that arise in the reproductive studies of the animal , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk of the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative effect on them .
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ma@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study lasting 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in people suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and 13,@@ 1 % in people under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study lasting 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 2@@ 3,5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in people suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term study period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters appeared , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ atine phase kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy and the occurrence associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and elevated mortality in elderly patients with dementia , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated dos@@ ages of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D @-@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ gen and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks in healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and in the put@@ ative .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents who attended the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measured scales , which were defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in the rel@@ ap@@ se rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l group and 57 % below placebo .
in an oo@@ oo@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the expansion and hydro@@ xy@@ meth@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ness is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination of ellip@@ ses is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l for extensive metabol@@ isation ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ) and nearly 146 hours at &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as did a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender dependent effects .
an exposure @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not indicate clin@@ ically significant differences in the eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects .
a single dose study in subjects with varying liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were only observed in case of dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have only limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent secondary kidney disease ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equal to 3 to 10 times the middle Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of hydrogen sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates in the gene of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l did not enter more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ x of the middle Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D @-@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an oo@@ oo@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio @-@ bio@@ availability study in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was compared with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Besi@@ des , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the bile from monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or 16 to 83 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ x of the middle Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly check ag@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution and begin with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended while b@@ yp@@ assing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical condition taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ utely treatment ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy &apos;s enam@@ el tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ gi@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were otherwise caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution is deemed necessary , patients should be observed in case of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure loss ( see Section 4.5 ) .
research on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution is not available to patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescri@@ bing or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , conduc@@ tion disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including active and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , occasional reports were reported during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ tic , poly@@ ure@@ tic , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and may lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was larger compared with the all@@ otted administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was used as one @-@ off intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and who simultaneously received Lor@@ ac@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist F@@ AM@@ I , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can result in the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after sett@@ ling the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of the se@@ dation was larger compared to that after the sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .

the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical studies with or@@ ally @-@ used arias ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study lasting 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in people under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in people under placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in people under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term study period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters appeared , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the adverse events associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy and the occurrence associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and elevated mortality in older patients with dementia , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ag@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility / behavi@@ our@@ al problems associated with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 hours ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gi@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms regarding the ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sions and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm .
the observed mean recovery from bas@@ eline on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe as@@ gi@@ bility , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents who attended the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measured scales , which were defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rel@@ ap@@ se rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an oo@@ oo@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , which were partially due to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to placebo in regards to the prevention of bi@@ polar feedback , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % bigger than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time until the maximum plasma level was reached at 1 to 3 hours after application .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15 and 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ern@@ al exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were only observed in case of dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have only limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al cor@@ tex toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equal to 3 to 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of hydrogen sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates in the gene of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 @-@ times the average steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters used to receive an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( as a single dose or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
only patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer were not able to distinguish between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterior@@ ating disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before or before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients in whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be given with other drugs in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel drugs in order to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment is not indicated ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in case of sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment must be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were conducted with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with impairment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel , which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient may not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in patients , no recur@@ rent treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
whereas a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea occur in patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is inevitable .
women of child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to do no child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised prior to the treatment of a sperm count since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the per@@ spir@@ ation and ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and major incidents of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer that were treated once every three weeks at 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
listed in Table 1 are the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for every dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no caus@@ al correlation with these events was established .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active substance that promotes the storage of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ ae and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation results in an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital Inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ tial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 Alb@@ um@@ receptor and occurs due to the alb@@ umin@@ binding protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the tumor area .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two non @-@ random@@ ised trials and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
in one study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ centric study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received pac@@ lit@@ axel within 3 weeks , either in the form of a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour trans@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only due to metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity vis @-@ à @-@ vis pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to decay at bas@@ eline based on the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials .
active Ex@@ pos@@ ure Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 following the addition of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and / or soft tissue binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study involving advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 m@@ g. / m2 of solvent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ axel .
pac@@ lit@@ axel clearance was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and the volume of distribution was higher ( 53 % ) at Abra@@ x@@ ane .
in published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily metabol@@ ised to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in people with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative absorption of the unchanged ingredient was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clear@@ ance .
however , only a few data have been available to patients at the age of more than 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light light protected over 8 hours .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicinal product approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; refer@@ enced drug &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood cancers , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood don@@ or is not possible prior to the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is to be expected .
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with disorders that the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood don@@ ors , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be monitored before treatment to ensure that iron deficiency is not present , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency or by preventing the body from responding adequately to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced that enables it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
when administered as an injection into a vein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems an@@ a@@ emia , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference medicine .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either en@@ capsul@@ ated or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of le@@ amed dis@@ s@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were studied in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values were maintained in the same degree as those who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ ra@@ ine @-@ like headaches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this will not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the evidence provided for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the European Union regulations proved that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that manufactures se@@ amed is provided for the medical specialist in all member states information packages , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a licence for the placing of dis@@ sen@@ amed in the whole European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma which receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( for example cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if bleeding @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , with planned major surgical procedures which require a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large electro @-@ orthop@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , where a high risk of trans@@ fusion compens@@ ations is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml may be applied , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , in which the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and as a result may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed over or below the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentrations of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is prescribed in the lowest approved dose needed for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the clinical results suggest that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
initial dose : 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired goal is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ emia symptoms and subsequent changes may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor .
given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentrations of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is prescribed in the lowest approved dose needed to control the an@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ dal number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to bas@@ eline , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ ti@@ dal number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l are increased compared to the bas@@ eline , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the repe@@ al cell number has increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained by 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
on the other hand , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) resp@@ . the Re@@ ti@@ dal number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , is an indication of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) in which the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned blood is required should be received twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery in a dose of 600 I.@@ E. / kg body weight .
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the onset of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the second stre@@ amed therapy .
6 . recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic salt solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine in the circulation .
patients who develop an ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) under the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed or any other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ ils ) .
patients with a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program are contra@@ indicated by the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or general diseases : severe coron@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of action defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes of failure ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ um@@ to@@ xi@@ fication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated .
if the recur@@ rence rate is lower , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes &quot; Index &quot; ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other cause of a loss of action is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row is considered to be considered a diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events was observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that can be attributed to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ine when the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration needed to control the an@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary heart disease or in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration below Section 4.2 .
according to current findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account in tumour patients receiving chemotherapy ( patients who may have to be trans@@ lat@@ ched ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the goal of keeping ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are fores@@ een for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine was not shown to improve overall survival in tumor patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy had a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 @-@ 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , retinal ar@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidney were reported in patients with ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , so also patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
irrespective of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , there may be th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ lic and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ esis and does not influence leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tumors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ osis .
survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed a significantly higher mortality rate than in the controls due to various pre@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and associated complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumor patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated IV application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels following intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal studies with approximately 20 times the daily recommended daily dose epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced fet@@ al body weight , a delay of the os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

prior to the market launch and by agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the holder of the marketing authorization has to provide the medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials : • Training bro@@ om@@ piece • summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packing instructions .
the owner of the marketing authorization has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ cr@@ ine gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application is set up and functional before the drug is put into circulation and as long as the drug is used in traffic .
the owners of the risk management plan specified in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan and additional pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance measures , as agreed in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the Marketing Au@@ thor@@ isation Plan , must be carried out in accordance with each successive update of the Risk Management Plan .
according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use , an updated R@@ MP should also be provided with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • when receiving new information , the impact on the current safety specification ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures could have been achieved within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones
• within a month prior to your treatment , a heart attack or stroke have suffered • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or increased chest pain ) , the risk of a drop of blood in the veins ( deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) exists - if for example , such a drop of blood has occurred .
you suffer from severe blood circulation disorders ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the carot@@ id ) or brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which is reg@@ ressed during further treatment .
your doctor may carry out regular blood tests to regularly control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dis@@ solving of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , loss of blood , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed before starting therapy .
the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin spra@@ yed with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin was reported very rarely after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sta@@ en@@ ia , it will break down your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be given by inj@@ ecting into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death can be increased .
in case of elevated or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels lie back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to current findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia associated with abnormal ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in adults with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa administration and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood pigment ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your devi@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of coron@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred in the past ( e.g. a deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pulmon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
in case you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and in some circumstances have a negative impact on the tumour .
if you are about to undergo a major orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the start of treatment .
if your values of the red blood cell ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed since there is an increased risk of developing blood cl@@ ots after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may make certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are the means to build up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections .
if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of your treatment and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia responds to treatment , the dose may be adjusted every four weeks until the condition is under control .
in order to ensure this and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will carry out regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of operation and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash out Ab@@ se@@ amed himself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , strokes , temporary circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , vascular extensions ( an@@ eur@@ ys@@ ms ) , thro@@ mb@@ oses of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidney were reported in patients with ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment .
eye li@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke @-@ ede@@ ma ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat sensation and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia means that no more red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Speci@@ fic caution in applying Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , blood cl@@ ot@@ ting ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) can occur regardless of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed .
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of bleeding after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your output is too high

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause as well as in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ ture ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic her@@ nia like in the eye ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following the in@@ fusion such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
in order to treat the disease , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data was used for the evaluation of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently undergone a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years has been studied .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in 3@@ 57 patients and compared to six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline value .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) .
in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most Ac@@ la@@ sta side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fusion .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion place and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ lo@@ sis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides explanations for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , the evidence of how to apply the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the marketing of Ac@@ la@@ sta across the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • Con@@ tra @-@ indication in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non smoking and healthy nutrition • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When referring to medical or nursing help
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women in men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men intraven@@ ous 5 mg ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
following treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta may be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) For patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents , Ac@@ la@@ sta , are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data for safety and efficacy are lacking .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ ts@@ mia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the onset of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive treatment .
for patients who require dental surgery , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical review by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta may be reduced by administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of adverse events reported as serious adverse events in patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) were the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) are listed in Table 1 .
kidney dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which expressed itself as a decrease of kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the changes in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the incidence of kidney failure as well as a restricted ren@@ al function were in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , transi@@ ent asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , showed up to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
all patients received supplementary adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently acquired hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion place such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was reported mainly in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures .
7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area in a patient with Ac@@ la@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients .
in the case of an over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral structure .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral body frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years and after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral body frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduction in the risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effect on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a constant effect over three years resulting in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) risk of hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ ic acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 % increase in bone density of lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , total hip by 6.0 % , but@@ t neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology with 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the pel@@ vic c@@ rest a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es .
in comparison to placebo , a micro@@ computer @-@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture .
bone turnover high@@ s The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during the study period .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % compared to the bas@@ eline and was kept at 28 % below the bas@@ eline value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the bas@@ eline until 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mortality rate was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D at all points of time compared to placebo .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment resulted in a 5.@@ 4 % increase in BM@@ D over 24 months compared to placebo , and 4.3 % of the total weight of the fem@@ ur .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in the clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of acet@@ la@@ sta was not inferior to the once @-@ weekly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at for the percentage change of lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at the Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially mild to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with the 2.5 to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in comparison to taking 30 mg peri@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was proven in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was maintained at 141 of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
single and multiple 5 and 15 minute in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic van@@ ishing from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ -@@ 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a prolonged exclusion period with a terminal eli@@ mination time t ½ g 146 hours .
the early stages of distribution ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total @-@ body clear@@ ance is independent of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced clearance of metabol@@ ised substances with cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney dysfunction up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid required .
since severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ inous Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) is limited to data , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ consecutive single @-@ dose intraven@@ ous single dose amounted to 10@@ mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in trials of dogs , single doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C , which were 6 times the recommended humane @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub @-@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats was administered intraven@@ ously , taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered in intervals of 2 @-@ 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ x the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection point appeared .
the most common finding in repeated applications was an increase in primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metaph@@ or of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats were observed with ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such as skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed on rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was less than 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels .

according to the CH@@ MP directive for risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known which could affect the current statements on safety , the pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached . • On request of the E@@ MEA .
z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a class of substances called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , for oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , which are made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass seen in men .
in Pa@@ get &apos;s disease bone reconstruction is done too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , ensuring a normal bone formation and thus rein@@ vigor@@ ating the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta along with foods and drinks , you are concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will have sufficient liquid before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks following the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
as Ac@@ la@@ sta is working for a long time , you may need to take another dose after one year or more .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if you miss the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .
before completing the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta Falls you should consider the termination of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
adverse events related to the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache , appear within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
it is currently unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .

allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , have been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if any of the listed side effects neg@@ atively affect you or you notice side effects that are not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
patients with a recently acquired low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are advised to carry out the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta patients have to be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important for patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic treatment .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic running , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently acquired low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
in addition to a diet and exercise for adult patients , A@@ COMP@@ LIA is used to treat adult patients suffering from obesity ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and / or overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more
in addition , four studies were carried out in more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ LIA was used as a supporting agent for smoking .
on the other hand , studies on smoking did not show consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ LIA was difficult to assess in this field of application .
what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ LIA ? it is the most common side @-@ effects of A@@ COMP@@ LIA that were detected during studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory tract infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among other things in a small minority of patients .
caution is advised while using A@@ COMP@@ LIA using medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for the use in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ COMP@@ LIA &apos;s efficacy in reducing weight in patients with obesity or obes@@ e
pharmaceuticals used in patients who need it for health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing information packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the Ar@@ z
in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which have one or more risk factors such as Type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ COMP@@ LIA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to lack of data for efficacy and safety .
depression or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of the treatment in the individual case prev@@ ails the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
also in patients who - besides obesity - do not have any recogn@@ is@@ able risks , can occur depres@@ sive reactions .
relatives or other related persons should point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant less than 6 months ago .

5.3 Evi@@ dent clinical data on safety and consequ@@ ential un@@ desirable effects that were not observed in clinical trials , but were found in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic area , were considered potentially relevant for clinical use :
in some , however , not in all cases , the onset of con@@ vul@@ sions seems to be connected with process @-@ related stress such as dealing with animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period prior to mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no adverse effects were observed on fertility or cycl@@ ine distur@@ b@@ ance .
the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant influence on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg per day .
in a study by rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and with lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory .

the present document is a summary of the European Public Health Review ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabe@@ tic medicine ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medication ( dual therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) , met@@ form@@ in can not be adjusted satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest acceptable dose .
in combination with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ or@@ um or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ or@@ um or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in triple therapy was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the triple therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of acet@@ one for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea showed a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving additional placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thal@@ am@@ an@@ es@@ thesia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
ac@@ tos can neither be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high levels of ket@@ one - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the course of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients in which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for placing an account within the European Union .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marker &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in people with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the treatment of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk due to the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should begin treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac safety .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ flow study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced mac@@ ular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased starting liver enzyme levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels are to be controlled again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked .
the decision to continue the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be conducted until the laboratory parameters have been determined by clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was demonstrated , which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution a slight reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
similar changes were observed in comparing controlled trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ ins by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.1 % and hem@@ at@@ o@@ glob@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients receiving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or triple combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ones , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported on a occurrence or worsen@@ ing of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acuity .
it is unclear if there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative study .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies evaluating the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the reduced insulin resistance of the mother animal under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth .
very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not inv@@ alu@@ able in this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tumor and refra@@ ction index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one AL@@ T @-@ asc@@ ents were often the same as in placebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ stoff .
in an outcome study in patients with advanced mac@@ ular disease , the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported about cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ isons of compar@@ isons .
in the Pro@@ Active study , which runs over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative study .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not occur any symptoms .
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activated activated rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ activation ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) activated by the activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) . this leads to increased insulin sensitivity in liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the onset of the therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of improvement with insulin were random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabe@@ tics in a small study of 18 weeks .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol and low but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced overall plas@@ mat@@ ogen@@ esis and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zid and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level .
compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while reduced values were observed under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one dis@@ counted not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , which both have an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ flow study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced mac@@ ular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly resor@@ bed , with the top concentrations of un@@ modified Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in the plasma usually reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness in roughly the triple of effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it has been proven that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have a relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was found mainly in the wood ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ modified Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and that of the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 @-@ 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the mother substance are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies were consistent with mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume increase with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the reduced insulin resistance of the mother animal under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ones led to increased frequency of col@@ onic tumors .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative study .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were investigated with both Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid .
in clinical trials for more than 1 year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one dis@@ counted not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , which both have an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study missed the target of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the overall mortal , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane was studied in 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use the insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c level suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered similar to that of another human insulin .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane must be adjusted if it is given together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weighed in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S authorisation for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , when rapid initial action along with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar levels have been significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy may change hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin in animal origin ) can cause a change in the dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , this may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the adjustment .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than their previous insulin .
before traveling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and consult his patients always according to other drugs taken by them .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with rapid or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of spl@@ itting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the division is active .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans .

► If you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to this insulin product , met@@ ac@@ res@@ ol or any of the other components ( see Section 7 more information ) .
if you notice first signs of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( symptoms of sub@@ ju@@ gation ) , pay attention to the symptoms described in 5 Which side effects are possible ?
if your doctor has caused a change from one insulin type or brand to another , you may need to adjust the dose by your doctor .
► Check the label if it is the right type of insulin ► In order to do this , specify the rubber embr@@ itt@@ lement with a medical swa@@ b .
if this is not completely und@@ am@@ aged , if you get a punc@@ tual bottle , return the water bottle to your dru@@ g@@ store ► if it hadn &apos;t been properly kept or frozen ( see 6 How is Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane to be stored ? ) ► If it is not even white and clou@@ dy after the res@@ us@@ en@@ code .
use the injection technique that your doctor or your die@@ ti@@ cian recommended to you ► Read the injection needle for at least 6 seconds under your skin to ensure that the full dose was inj@@ ected .
the warning signs of sub@@ ju@@ gation can suddenly occur and may be : cold sweat , cold pale skin , headache , heart ras@@ ps , nausea , severe hunger , temporary visual disturbances , drow@@ sin@@ ess , unusual ti@@ redness and weakness , nerv@@ ousness or trem@@ ors , anxiety , confusion , concentration difficulties .
tell your relatives , friends and close colleagues that in case of un@@ consciousness they bring you to the stable side position and immediately notify a doctor .
► If a hard sub@@ stitution is not treated , this may lead to ( temporary or permanent ) brain damage or even death ► If you had a sub@@ jun@@ c@@ tive with un@@ consciousness or if you have frequent under@@ growth , consult your doctor .
you can recover the consciousness quicker if the hormone Glu@@ c@@ agon is inj@@ ected by a person familiar with its gift .
this can happen : • If you inj@@ ure too much insulin • if you eat too little or leave a meal • if you are more than otherwise physically challenged .
increased fatigue , thirst , loss of appetite , nausea , vom@@ iting , drow@@ sin@@ ess or fatigue , redness , dry skin , dry mouth and fruity ( after acet@@ one ) sm@@ elling breath .
• You forgot an insulin injection • repeated inj@@ ections of less insulin as you need • an infection or fever - more food than usual • less physical exercise than usual .
if you often give yourself an injection at the same place , the sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue can shrink ( li@@ pat@@ ro@@ phy ) or increase ( lip@@ oh@@ y@@ per@@ trop@@ hi@@ e ) .
if you notice depres@@ sions or thick@@ ening of your skin at the injection point , tell your doctor or your die@@ ti@@ cian regarding this , as these reactions can wor@@ sen or affect your insulin sensitivity when inj@@ ecting into such a position .
immediately consult a doctor if the symptoms of allergy are spread to other parts of the body , or if you suddenly feel uncomfortable and you have per@@ spir@@ ation , nausea ( vom@@ iting ) , breathing difficulties , heart ras@@ ps , you are di@@ zzy or you have the impression to become unconscious .

the Nov@@ o@@ let production pens , which are used shortly or as a replacement , are not stored in the refrigerator .
it is recommended - after removing from the refrigerator - the temperature of the Nov@@ o@@ let production pens rise to room temperature before the insulin is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ed for the first use according to the instruction manual .
always set the closure cap of your Nov@@ o@@ let production pens when Nov@@ o@@ let is not in use to protect the insulin from light .
how Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane looks and contents of the pack The injection @-@ suspension is delivered as a clou@@ dy , white , aqu@@ eous suspension into packs of 5 or 10 production pens per 3 ml .
before each injection , check if at least 12 units of insulin are left in the cartridge to ensure an even mixture .
follow these steps to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ let with the injection needle • Take a couple of times with your finger easily against the cartridge .
if air bubbles are present , they will collect in the cartridge at the top • Whi@@ le you continue to hold Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ let with the injection needle , rotate the cartridge by one click in the direction of the arrow ( figure D ) • Now you have to leak a drop of insulin from the tip of the injection needle .
• Connect the connection box to the finished pen again , that the digit is 0 compared to the metering mark ( Fig@@ ure E ) • Check whether the button is pressed completely .
if not , turn the cap until the press button is pressed completely • Hold your Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ let horizontal .
if the button cannot move freely to the outside , the insulin is pushed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the press button moves outward , while you turn the cap • The scale below the push button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
check the number on the closure cap right next to the dosage brand • Noti@@ fy the highest number you can see on the press scale • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the inserted dose • If you have set a wrong dose , simply turn the closure cap forward or backward until you have set the correct number of units .
otherwise insulin is extracted from the injection needle and the inserted dose will not be correct • If you have mistakenly attempted to set a dose of more than 78 units , follow these steps :
then remove the cap and set it up again in such a way that the 0 of the metering mark is opposite .
make sure to press the press button only during the injection . • Hold down the press button after the injection until the injection needle is removed from the skin .
if not , turn the cap until the press button is pressed completely and then proceed as described before use • You can hear a clicking sound when pressing the press button .
it may be in@@ accurate • You can not set a dose higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual quantities scale to estimate how much insulin is left .

if two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of the fast acting insulin must first be raised , then the amount of the long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , this may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the adjustment .
before traveling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical procedures showed that a nor@@ mo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar 4,@@ 4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs. 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration amounts to about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adolescents ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

this can happen : • If you inj@@ ure too much insulin • if you eat too little or leave a meal • if you are more than otherwise physically challenged
always set the closure cap of your Nov@@ o@@ let production pens when it is not in use to protect it from light .
• Dis@@ connect the rubber membrane with a medical swa@@ b • Use a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Take the injection needle straight and firmly to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ let ( Fig@@ ure A ) • Use the large outer cover of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
follow these steps to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ let with the injection needle • Take a couple of times with your finger easily against the cartridge .
if air bubbles are present , they will collect in the cartridge at the top • Whi@@ le you continue to hold the injection needle , rotate the cartridge by one click in the direction of the arrow ( Fig@@ ure B ) • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues pointing upwards , press the button ( figure C ) • Now you have to pour a drop of insulin from the tip of the injection needle .
• Connect the connection box to the finished pen again , that the digit is 0 compared to the metering mark ( figure D ) • Check whether the button is pressed completely .
if the button cannot move freely , the insulin is pushed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the press button moves outward , while you turn the cap • The scale below the press button ( push@@ button dial ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Take the highest number you can see on the press scale • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the inserted dose • If you have set a wrong dose , simply turn the cap on@@ ward or backwards until you have set the correct number of units .
turn them until the push button is down and you feel a resistance . then turn off the cap and set it up again so that the 0 of the metering mark is opposite .
make sure to press the press button only during injection • Hold down the press button after the injection until the injection needle is removed from the skin .
it may be in@@ accurate • You can not set a dose which is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the remaining quantity scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you can not use it to adjust or select your dose .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who are already showing signs of crystal de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ out notes ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger urine crystals , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still above 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first months of treatment , pal@@ sy cases may still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients continue to use more drugs to prevent g@@ out attacks during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year .
in both studies , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood during the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily received 120 mg , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in reducing the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood , aden@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to pri@@ me@@ val deposits ( including an illness known from the medical history or current arthritis and / or g@@ out arthritis ) .
if the serum cholesterol level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily .
efficacy and safety have not yet been fully studied in patients with severe kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents because there is no experience in children and adolescents , the use of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients .
transplan@@ t Rec@@ ei@@ vers Sin@@ ce there is no experience in organ transplan@@ ts , the use of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or un@@ compensated heart failure treatment with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other res@@ inous medicines , acute rheum@@ atism may occur during the course of treatment , because the reduction of serum res@@ ins may initially mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver diseases Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , mild cases of liver function were observed in patients treated with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to conduct a liver function test before the start of the f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ sis and in the further course according to clinical diagnosis ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine tin was not performed interactions with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll level ( a hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times daily with an increase in f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ sis ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .

in a study involving subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x operated a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C in Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , suggest@@ ing a possible low inhibit@@ ory effect of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that simultaneous sei@@ z@@ ure containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , the absorption of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) delayed and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , however no significant change in the AU@@ C causes .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not cause side effects of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al correlation with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at was detected .
risk factors identified in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ kler@@ ec@@ tomy and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects , which could be found in the treatment groups of 80 mg / 120 mg f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below .
diar@@ rhea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In the clinical studies , no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Off@@ ered long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients aged up to 4 years with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
treatment @-@ related events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ - treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :

in humans , ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ ine metabolism and occurs in the context of the reaction as@@ k@@ ade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ure@@ a .
f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent non @-@ Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vitro in@@ hibition that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX trial and F@@ ACT study , as described below ) , which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study of the proportion of patients with the last three month specific serum res@@ ins level &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with serum incre@@ ment value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the reduction of serum res@@ ins below 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see Table 2 and Fig@@ ure 1 ) . the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with traditionally used doses al@@ loc@@ at@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the usual dose of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 times daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were combined for analysis . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ hr@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the reduction of serum res@@ ins level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl got 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h .
with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C the primary efficacy end@@ point was at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients achieved .
there was no clin@@ ically significant difference in the percentage of serum resin concentrations in subjects , irrespective of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum res@@ ins ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum resin concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( Bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the open extension study in phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum res@@ ins levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheum@@ atic attacks ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a dispens@@ ing ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the g@@ out node by month 24 .
increased SH@@ E values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ W / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at were dose @-@ proportion@@ ately after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses .
for f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at doses ranging between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum resin concentration provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma connection of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration @-@ width reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ waves , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites were predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly generated by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose in the urine was found to be unchanged F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , about 45 % of the dose in the stools was found to be unchanged F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .

these findings are regarded as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and are considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were about 4 times the rate of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which was associated with a reduction in the breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who took al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that suggests that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing ) , det@@ ained abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) , and sour upset .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with allergic hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components .
it may not be used in diseases of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd . a permit for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or taking medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following indications are to be carefully observed in order to reduce the risk of adverse reactions and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ ed@@ ings or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except for p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic are given only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al frac@@ tures , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( some of them were serious and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that point to possible adverse reactions , and patients should be advised to remove the medicine for symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ spec@@ tively burning the medicine and getting medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 . the risk of serious adverse events seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and continue to take it after the onset of symptoms that point to an o@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
whereas in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were rarely reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ mens include intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available that give clu@@ es as to whether the removal of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a s@@ late surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment of the attending physician is key to therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , they should take the tablet next morning after notic@@ ing its failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled weekly day .
other diseases that affect mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated appropriately before the onset of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE therapy .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at if taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials jointly with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions occurring .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ative women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports are from cancer patients but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
however , serum @-@ calcium intake up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar incidence .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ sequence an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is the increase in the intestinal resor@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III studies , the average asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % on the chan@@ ter .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to stop ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily for either 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo -@@ 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption Based on an intraven@@ ous reference dose , the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after a night of fasting and two hours before receiving a standardized breakfast .
the bio@@ availability was reduced to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day .
in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats revealed that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in tissue sections according to intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radio@@ activity were ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fa@@ eces .
according to intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clear@@ ance ran@@ ged from Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs by these transport systems .

characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the portion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although there is no clinical data about it , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
for this reason , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone is expected in patients with reduced kidney function ( see Section 4.2 ) .

adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have transplan@@ ted kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organs through the immune system .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f are already used in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previous studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a year of treatment ( for example , by examining how often a new organ transplan@@ t or a re@@ intake of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter trials were conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examined , such as Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f in comparison to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f taken by the body .
trem@@ ors , headache , nausea , vom@@ iting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , elevated blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) and in@@ som@@ nia .
in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied .
patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious if other ( especially some herbal ) drugs are taken at the same time using adv@@ agra@@ f as the dosage dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be appropriately adjusted accordingly .
hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange jel@@ ly capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule upper with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule portion with &quot; W@@ 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder .
only doctors who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of adverse events , including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dose ; changes of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the strict supervision of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of an alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of adv@@ ant should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations ) .
after switching from Progra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after change@@ over .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a level mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
meti@@ culous and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ king level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ ts under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night@@ transplan@@ t phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ clear@@ ance compound , an adjustment of the advance dose can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral consumption of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application Dur@@ ing the suppression of the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustment may later be necessary , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - switch from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted from two daily dose of Progra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this conversion has to take place at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplantation After a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to adv@@ ant once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection has to begin with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are converted to adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg per day is taken once a day once a day .
other recipients , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ agra@@ f in pulmon@@ ary , p@@ ank@@ reas@@ - and col@@ on transplan@@ ts , was used in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , with p@@ ank@@ re @-@ transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustment in specific patient groups patients with limited h@@ ep@@ atic function To maintain blood thal@@ ates in the targeted area may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders to reduce the dose .
kidney function Sin@@ ce the kidney function does not have an effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cholesterol levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine office and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on Tal@@ king Point in Full Blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases using full @-@ blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level controls .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ king levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ level mirrors of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Progra@@ f to advance , dose adjustment , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances which could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adap@@ tations of the dose may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level mirrors in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations is usually in the range from 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this has resulted in serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects caused by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under or over exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dose ; changes of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the strict supervision of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation are available .
there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of adv@@ agra@@ f for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood .
due to possible interactions that may lead to a degradation of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood and weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may be avoided or other herbal remedies during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to significant fluctuations .
in rare cases , an aqu@@ eous or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and o@@ ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headache , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and visual disturbances , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , special caution is required in patients with the rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ P can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while simultaneously offering substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage accordingly to maintain uniform concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ eyel@@ id antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical studies sur@@ rendered that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal transit .
highly d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus effect on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed with medicines , which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism is affected .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the exposure of hormones , decisions regarding contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures should be especially cau@@ tious .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially decrease the clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplantation patients do not indicate that , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus has an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the adverse event profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects after their frequency are listed in descending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) .

cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including treatment with Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in combination with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high bonding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ zable .
action mechanism and phar@@ ma @-@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular core .
this leads to a calcium @-@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , thereby preventing the tran@@ scription of a specific series of lymph@@ oma genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

lung transplan@@ t In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ center study with oral program , more than 110 patients were reported , who were either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ ato@@ - syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it was found in 21.@@ 7 % of cases to develop a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients that were converted from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was increased after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the transplantation @-@ transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of recur@@ rent bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ as transplan@@ t A multi@@ center study with oral program was conducted to 205 patients who simultaneously underwent a pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ t following a random@@ ised procedure tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( by protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached at the goal level from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
gut transplantation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric clinical study with oral program as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after col@@ on transplan@@ tations showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for the early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 @-@ antagon@@ ist d@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which lead to tal@@ lies between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , An@@ n Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) .
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metabol@@ ised before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done by bile .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Progra@@ f in stable patients treated by Progra@@ f ( twice daily ) in the ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ king levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation are available .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and o@@ ede@@ ma .
28 confirmed ev@@ acu@@ ations within the first 24 weeks of the advance group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) amounted to 32.@@ 6 % and in the Progra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % .
the efficacy and safety of Progra@@ f , C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared in combination with Basili@@ xi@@ mab , antibody production , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , in 6@@ 38 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t recipients .

in total , 34 Pati@@ ents of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in were converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , whereas only 6 Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus patients needed another therapy ( Bech@@ stein et al . , Transplan@@ tation 2004 ; 77 : 12@@ 21 ) .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge caused by the deficiency of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ a is used to treat ble@@ ed@@ ings or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes cl@@ ot@@ ting problems like bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced which enables it to form the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate is similar to another approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was investigated to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ a in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
lawyers may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II , m@@ aus@@ al or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing on the market for Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , on the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
inj@@ ections every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute depression are removed .
inj@@ ections repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the treatment process , proper determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis To the long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the rate of administration should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) versus Factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VI@@ II @-@ directional Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in the case of pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ or development , a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product was observed after conversion of ( low @-@ ti@@ pped ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences about the application of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
in the majority of patients A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors for Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) who had previously untreated patients who had a higher risk of forming inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop of the blood co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II @-@ level occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout time and both the factor VI@@ II levels in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient levels again on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E on 145 children and adults 2 with acute severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 days of exposure with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E .
in addition , none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients in a current clinical study 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients were inhibit@@ ors to factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed either a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that referred to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes had been reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reports about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II works as a co@@ of@@ ac@@ tor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients equal to or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , based on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which necess@@ it@@ ates submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , the CH@@ MP has decided to apply for further extension procedures in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited officially announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company res@@ umes its application for authorisation for the use of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in adv@@ ex@@ in is an aden@@ o@@ virus that has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot cause infections in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumors and thus enable cancer cells to re @-@ establish normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene that is not present in the human body , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly and the cancer cells can grow further and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer occurred in the area of under@@ growth , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP examined the answers given by the company to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the initial documents , the CH@@ MP reports on day 120 a list of questions sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not proved sufficiently that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ our brings benefits to patients .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
moreover , the company did not prove sufficiently that adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not know the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal had consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; com@@ bo @-@ use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are put together so that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal hypo@@ aller@@ genic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , an allergy to pol@@ len caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( nas@@ al nose ) .
for adults and young people aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membrane ( c@@ logged nose ) , are sub@@ ver@@ ted .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effects were the changes in the sever@@ ity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all hay fever symptoms except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who took aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was examined , the patients with Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ asing ) , oral dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ com@@ edi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , ur@@ inary retention ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk for a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the European Commission for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms decay .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks of ending such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ id , sili@@ fici@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ g@@ ot@@ amine or other Dek@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient and the data is not sufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or strengthening of the headache ) must be dis@@ continued .
patients with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , b@@ lower ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should be dep@@ rec@@ ated at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can otherwise inhi@@ bit or reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions .
however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed in the context of clinical trials with and@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between those treated with or placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether or not they were taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded altogether .
in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases there may be a di@@ zz@@ iness that may result in impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ ce .
headache , anxiety , mental depression , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ corro@@ sive pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , just like at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ illary rigi@@ dity and di@@ lat@@ ation , skin ery@@ thema , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ s as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ sel@@ ector on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study conducted with adults , D@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not affect standard measurement parameters including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was found at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall score for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show any significant differences regarding gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze , the body is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of dosing in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects were badly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the all@@ otted administration of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was to exposure after injection of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
however , based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with a lost body cannot be identified with any particular danger to humans .
the combination did not have greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient called Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats at a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg per day and on rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation , a pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .
20 . under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ c@@ ous membrane of the drug pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine .
( diabetes ) , a sten@@ osi@@ tive stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer leading to a con@@ stri@@ ction of stomach , small intest@@ ine or es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a closure of the stomach or du@@ oden@@ um , a bladder neck closure , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ ms in the medical history ( short@@ ness of breath due to a cra@@ mp of lung mus@@ cul@@ ature ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder .
tell your doctor if you experience or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases when you are using aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • Blood pressure • heart ch@@ asing , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • Cardi@@ ovascular disorders • nausea and headaches or strengthening existing headache .
if you are taking Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
in case of use in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze will lead to light @-@ he@@ ade@@ dness or decrease the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of a@@ ero than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of a@@ ero than you should .
if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the dose as soon as possible and use the next dose at the scheduled time .
please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will affect you significantly or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
heart ch@@ asing , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , throat pain , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .
heart pal@@ pit@@ ations or heart rhythm disorders , increased physical activity , redness , hot fl@@ ushes , confusion , blur@@ red vision , dry eyes , nas@@ al bleeding , nas@@ al sin@@ us , nausea , stools , changes in the frequency of ur@@ ination , it@@ ching , ch@@ ills , reduction of sense of smell , noticeable h@@ ep@@ atic values , anxiety , anxiety and irrit@@ ability .
after the market introduction of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , it was rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of prominent liver strains has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for taking ( soluble tablets ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal variations in rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
effectiveness has been measured by examining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rant , disability of sleep and capacity in the day ) before and after six weeks treatment .
further studies have been submitted to demonstrate that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of am@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptoms of symptoms ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of the symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lau@@ com@@ edi@@ n , or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted SP Europe a permit for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the present disease process and can be terminated after the decay of the symptoms and resum@@ ed in their re@@ occurring .
the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to the patient during the allergy season .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with the di@@ lu@@ or@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to light @-@ he@@ ade@@ dness which may result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was headaches , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and in 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) .
this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ s as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ sel@@ ector on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study involving multiple doses that was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in a single dose study with adults , D@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be classified as an alternative in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and per@@ s@@ isti@@ fying allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the overall survey of the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergies .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology despite the eti@@ ology of different forms is similar and chronic patients can be random@@ ly recru@@ ited .
since hist@@ am@@ ination is a caus@@ ative factor in all cases of ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is expected that in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria , in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is expected to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical practice guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and lowering the size and number of qu@@ ads at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study .
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which the patient demo@@ bil@@ s were comparable to the general seasonal @-@ allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
in @-@ vi@@ vo des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7,5 mg meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with and@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ com@@ edi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with respect to the toxic@@ ity profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a comparable degree of exposure to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with a lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular danger to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that there are no data available to support treatment of an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role .
approximately 6 % of adults and children metabol@@ ise metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n between 2 and 11 years and experience greater substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is highly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children who met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normal .
this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ lac@@ tose @-@ absorption or su@@ c@@ ase @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies using A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents who were given up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) .
children aged 1 to 11 who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents found no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
with a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect psych@@ om@@ otor impairment .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither a reinforcement of the alcohol @-@ induced loss of performance nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the overall survey of the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal aller@@ genic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and lowering the size and number of qu@@ ads at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the loading ( AU@@ C ) by des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ value of about 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In several one @-@ dose clinical studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ h@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable to pedi@@ atric patients at recommended doses with those of adults who received des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded altogether .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III bra@@ in@@ glass bottles with child @-@ safe polypropylene closure cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tray must be removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets in children under 6 years of age have not been proven yet .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s enam@@ el tablet proved to be the bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for the formulation of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s enam@@ el tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company withdraw@@ s its application for the use of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and elderly to the protection against flu , which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus which might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man , because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after the vaccine is passed , the immune system recogn@@ ises the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to form antibodies more quickly in a contact with a flu virus of this tribe .
subsequently , the membrane envelope of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recogn@@ ises as a body foreign ) was puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this did not extend the scope of the clinical data base to evaluate the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and need more information regarding your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you require further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients unable to swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed once the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral medicines the patient had previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus being addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between 4 and 12 years of age and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose is based on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infection related to AIDS and disease .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicine A@@ gener@@ ase reinforced with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment just as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there was a stronger decrease in the viral load after four weeks with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
the most common A@@ gener@@ a side effects ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients who take St. John &apos;s Wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicinal products , which are also reduced to health detri@@ mental in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ a reduce the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or immune activation syn@@ dro@@ mes ( symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase were out@@ weighed in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally authorised under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the placing of car@@ avans in the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
normally A@@ gener@@ a capsules are supposed to be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day , with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of ag@@ gra@@ zing ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction with caution , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used at the same time with drugs that have a low therapeutic lati@@ tude and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ a capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences .
in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing h@@ ep@@ atic function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ a and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous dosing of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ mals R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however , the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored at O@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high level of propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the A@@ gener@@ a solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the incidence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases associated with the treatment of medications that are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug addic@@ tive factors , such as a lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections , leading to severe clinical condition or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol intake , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ar@@ se were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not simultaneously be given with drugs that have a low therapeutic lati@@ tude and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are primarily metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the lower plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse reactions to the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus and , if possible , check the viral load and reduce the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % , by contrast , increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily were used to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this treatment regi@@ at@@ as .
52 % lower if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was given .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ o in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but it is recommended that Di@@ dan@@ o &apos;s an@@ es@@ thesia is at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effects of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ a@@ viruses could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ stitu@@ tive plasma levels .
when used together , caution is advised ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
when it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ a , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 m@@ g. of f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2.@@ 69@@ time compared to the value observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily with no simultaneous use of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may , if used together with A@@ gener@@ a , may lead to interactions .
the patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs when used in combination with A@@ gener@@ a .
based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ a , as it may lead to resor@@ ption dysfunction .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme reduc@@ ers ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ ni@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ den@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ chol@@ ec@@ pin and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
simultaneous use with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days per person , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which strongly depend on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to increase the plasma levels at the same time as A@@ gener@@ a .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations up to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , since the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while the addition of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be increased ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in conjunction with oral m@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while using par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am while at the same time using par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3 to 4 @-@ Fa@@ che .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored at O@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to adjust the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dosage if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ as along with A@@ gener@@ ase is recommended for increased control of IN@@ R ( international norm@@ ative ratio ) because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended while using A@@ gener@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful weighing of possible use for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tose @-@ related rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leaves people in breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during breast @-@ feeding .
further development of the offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the treatment of A@@ gener@@ a were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to the treatment break@@ age .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with taking A@@ gener@@ a or other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the adverse events listed below stem from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed at more than 1 % of patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and facial fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervical fat accumulation .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated individuals who had been treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine or Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine for a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ ack ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 there were 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moder@@ ately distinct , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ules , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment having to be canc@@ eled with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice a day with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) to those who were observed under sole A@@ gener@@ ase treatment , were very common in patients who received A@@ gener@@ a along with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral g@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ prec@@ urs@@ ors with the consequence of an formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described rarely were observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously untreated patients who received 700@@ mg F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / L , I@@ 47@@ V , G@@ 48@@ V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , A@@ 7@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were treated with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / S , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ v@@ ase @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( division points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic samples with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r creates a certain cross resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients in which a f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus hal@@ ted ( one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ v@@ ase @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early termination of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , with PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ one ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ le@@ aching threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ ble@@ ached A@@ gener@@ a is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 was treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ a &apos;s solution for inhal@@ ing and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low d@@ osed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s agreed together with A@@ gener@@ a .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral dosing , the mean duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r amounts approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
by contrast , 50@@ 8 % is increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given twice daily with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influences the rate and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during dosing intervals fluctu@@ ates depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines which indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ a capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is less bio@@ available from the solution than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on one milli@@ gram base .
the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction is likely to be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment regi@@ mens lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained twice daily on healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , in male animals en@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas in do@@ si@@ fications containing the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.2 @-@ times ( rat ) of human exposure after twice daily administration of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and therapeu@@ tical application , showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro gene @-@ oxidation tests , the bacterial reverse mutation testing ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations were included in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and detected in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ a nor after the end of the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated aged 4 days showed high mortality both in the control and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in a systemic plasma exposition which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeutic doses , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes have been observed , indicating a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of ag@@ gra@@ zing ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application should be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ mals R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be stopped at the age of 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ tive factors , such as a lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50@@ 8 % , by contrast , increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
when used together , caution is advised ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
when it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ a , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ ni@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ chol@@ ec@@ pin and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days per person , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ as along with A@@ gener@@ ase is recommended for increased control of IN@@ R ( international norm@@ ative ratio ) because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ ons ) led to a decrease of the AU@@ C and C@@ min from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or respectively .
this drug may be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of possible use for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast @-@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ v@@ ase @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; A@@ gener@@ a should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during dosing intervals fluctu@@ ates depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady state over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines which indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction is likely to be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , in male animals en@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages that were equivalent to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.2 @-@ times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there is little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and therapeu@@ tical applications .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gene @-@ oxidation tests , the bacterial reverse mutation testing ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated aged 4 days showed high mortality both in the control and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the metabolism paths are not fully mature so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z .
A@@ gener@@ a &apos;s solution to intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the benefit of using rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; ble@@ ached &quot; A@@ gener@@ a solution for intake was neither occupied with PI pre @-@ treated patients nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , as soon as they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ a solution for intake and low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination in these patient groups is avoided .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ yl @-@ gly@@ co@@ lic acid , A@@ gener@@ a is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous dosing can lead to a competitive inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of these medicines and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ mals R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be stopped permanently if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with medication 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50@@ 8 % , by contrast , increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous use with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and result in side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on the data of 54 different C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ P inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am expects a significant increase in plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for the human being is not known . A@@ gener@@ a &apos;s solution to inhal@@ ation may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the prop@@ yl @-@ gly@@ co@@ l contained ( see Section 4.3 ) .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tose @-@ related rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leaves people in breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during breast @-@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with taking A@@ gener@@ a or other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described rarely were observed .
early termination of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .

in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active substance ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo performed either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tumors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two trials involving 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • The total recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % in the placebo group compared to 0 % to 3 % .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic ak@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immuno@@ competent adults if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or accept@@ ability of a cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
on Mon@@ days , Wedn@@ es@@ days and Fri@@ days or Tu@@ es@@ days , Thurs@@ days and Satur@@ days , apply before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine is to continue until all visible angles have disappeared in the genital or per@@ ic@@ anal@@ tal region , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated lesi@@ ons are only completely healed , another therapy should be initiated ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should take care of the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapy plan .
apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the puri@@ fied , infected skin area until the cream is fully absorbed .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a weighing between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a stri@@ k@@ tur leading to circumcision were observed .
when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation is observed , which necess@@ itated treatment and / or led to temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outlet of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream directly after treatment with other stimul@@ ants applied to the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and per@@ ic@@ anal@@ ges@@ ic area is not yet clinical experience .
although limited data suggest an increased rate of cow@@ or@@ age reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream has shown less efficacy in this patient group regarding the disposal of cow@@ ards .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od inside 1 cm around the eyel@@ id , nose , lips , or hair@@ line has not been studied .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions build up after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the recovery of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since no data on long @-@ term treatment rates of more than 36 months after treatment are available , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in case of ultra @-@ specific bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experiences in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the use in pre @-@ treated tumors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine therapy .
i@@ ri@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the li@@ b .
very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses in anatom@@ ical locations outside the face and scal@@ p are available .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually take in the course of therapy in intensity or go back after setting the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if local skin reactions cause major discomfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 lesi@@ ons had a lower total recovery rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .
due to immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with care in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) have been achieved either after a one @-@ off or after several times topical application , no recommendation can be given for application during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects in studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions on the site of the treatment of the cow@@ ards ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most frequently reported and probably or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the related side effects include discomfort on the application location with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme treated in a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical study were shown below .
the most common adverse event , probably or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cr@@ ème , was a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) in these studies .
the adverse events reported in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream were listed below .
the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream we frequently encountered local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ ch@@ ori@@ ation / ab@@ sc@@ aling ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these studies , with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe erosion ( 13 % ) , and severe shor@@ tening and evap@@ oration ( 19 % ) occurred .
in clinical trials investigating the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment center or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ adver@@ bial oral intake of 200 mg i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headaches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the most clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ ony which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , increasing systemic concentrations of the alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies it was possible to demonstrate that efficacy is significantly superior to a complete healing of the cow@@ ards during I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo .
in 60 % of patients who had been treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the cow@@ ards completely healed ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients who received placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing was achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ mal@@ ting use per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the tumors were hist@@ ologically confirmed primary super@@ fici@@ al@@ ant bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period of time , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic lesi@@ ons within a related 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ easy scal@@ p or face .
the two @-@ year data from two combined observ@@ ational studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing following one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications external stimul@@ i , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis and super cell carcin@@ oma generally do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Creme is examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or up ) .
minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed in three times weekly application for 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml during application in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated obvious half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ value after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or ultra @-@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg resulted in significantly lowered body weight and increased lac@@ ing weight ; a study conducted for the der@@ mal application for four months resulted in no similar effects on the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice following mal@@ er administration three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not dis@@ cour@@ aged , a risk to humans is considered very low due to systemic exposure .
the tumours appeared in the group of mice treated with the agent @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger number than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ sati@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( symptoms which are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , complic@@ ating movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye disease .
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
ad@@ minist@@ ering al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alizing devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study , the safety of the drug was examined , however , its efficacy was measured ( by examining its effect regarding reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me reduced G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion place .
very common side effects in patients under five years of age are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will check every year all new information that may be known , and if necessary update this summary .
the producer of Al@@ sati@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in response to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the distribution of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ sati@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any adverse event occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only occur in a suitable clinical environment in which recovery facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 trial , it is expected that virtually all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions have to be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
due to the theoretically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment , there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption .
pre @-@ treat 60 minutes before onset of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti @-@ py@@ re@@ tic ) in order to minimize the potential incidence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the event of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion has to be stopped until symptoms have been reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular in@@ takes of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
experimental studies do not om@@ it direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data in new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ sati@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly reported as in@@ fusion @-@ related responses , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older for a duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following the following frequency : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditional participation in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing difficulty and face ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted Drug Re@@ perc@@ ussions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe form and duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients received a ser@@ o@@ conversion within 3 months after the onset of the treatment , with a more severe form of follow @-@ up in patients under the age of 5 ( on average after 26 days of 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until early retirement from the study ) no antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say , among them 3 patients who had never had a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ic version .
patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine had to be detected .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 trial and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic larvae activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the treatment of enzymes is in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the cycle and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients had the medi@@ an phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ sati@@ az@@ y@@ me every week for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed improvement in lung function and ability to be treated in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ sati@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ sati@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ sati@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as indicated in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the total lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ izer before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , clin@@ ically significant changes were taken across across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test , motion area of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , was generally an improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in Har@@ n in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were found after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe current form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe form of delay only limited or even no progress in cognitive development had to be detected .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms dosage schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute ga@@ it test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
dosing regi@@ mens with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a one @-@ off application , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other drugs except those listed below 6.@@ 6 .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( cancer treatments ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole treatment in patients who have not previously been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens .
to reduce side effects , the patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the application of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicine for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( in order to prevent a fluid deficiency ) should be given .
in patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed , removed or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed thus s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
converting P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form is easier for cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin out@@ lived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the exclusive administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7,@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta demonstrated longer survival compared to the comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.@@ 2@@ ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a 25 mg / ml solution .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosing is removed from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ single @-@ cell@@ ed bron@@ chi@@ al cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma after prior chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift and on the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid will be given .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) a week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third operation cycle .
in patients who receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood count should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and plat@@ el@@ et teeth .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose @-@ examination must take place taking into account the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
if patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value prior to treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose duk@@ es a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies did not indicate that in patients aged 65 or above , there is an increased risk of side effects compared to patients aged 65 and older .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials , no dose adjustment was necessary for patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 45 ml / min , which would go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 @-@ fold the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 0 @-@ fold the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ c@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be administered to patients before their absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the absolute neutr@@ ality of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te numbers and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous courses of treatment ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was treated when a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed need to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ - lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with a long half @-@ time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients with these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment should be weighed .
5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported occasionally in clinical trials involving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed when this drug was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated lif@@ es ( excluding yellow fever , this ino@@ cul@@ ation is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is possible by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the course of treatment to obtain advice on the sperm count .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can result in reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed separation with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is recommended if high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be applied in high doses in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses should be avoided for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since no data is present regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ agulation status during the illness and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected for an application in pregnancy .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy , except if it is essential and after careful consideration of the benefit for the mother and the risk of the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is possible by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to seek advice on the sperm configuration .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is excessive in breast milk and unwanted effects in breast@@ fed infants can not be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and the random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

for this table a threshold of 5 % was specified regarding the inclusion of all events in which the reporting doctor considered a connection with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for possible .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasional ) of patients who were random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included ar@@ rhyth@@ mia and motor neu@@ rop@@ athy .

for this table , a threshold of 5 % was specified regarding the inclusion of all events in which the reporting doctor considered a connection to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for possible .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasional ) of patients who were random@@ ised p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mia .
clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 of three P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ mono@@ therap@@ i@@ ae ( n = 164 ) , excluding neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal bas@@ eline values of the liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that could be possible in connection with the study medication ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSCLC , random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , and 8@@ 30 patients with NSCLC , random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

for this table , a threshold of 5 % was specified for the inclusion of all events in which the reporting doctor considered a correlation with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity related to ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( often ) of patients who were random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity related to &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients ran@@ - dom@@ ic@@ ated c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included :
severe cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were occasionally reported in Clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , which is commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
from clinical studies , patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ation , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis , and ty@@ ph@@ ni@@ litis ) .
in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
it was reported cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients treated before , during or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate which exercises its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed works as anti@@ fol@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ late syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ de for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are nucle@@ oti@@ de @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin at chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically important advantage of an overall medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month prolonged survival compared to those patients treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the common c@@ is@@ pla@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and worsen@@ ing lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was medi@@ an survival time of 8.@@ 3 months with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA patients ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients receiving doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival was observed in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ disk epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0,@@ 0@@ 47 ) , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separately controlled , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) are similar for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination opposite gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 31.@@ 3 ) for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin compared to 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25,@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the impact of NSCLC history on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ c significant for non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ lower limit of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te transfer fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , patients sel@@ f@@ used the gift of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ opo@@ ie@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed after administration as a mono@@ therapeu@@ tics were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion areas over a period of 10 minutes .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is returned in the urine within 24 hours of the application .

dissolve the contents of the 100 mg capsule bottles with 4.@@ 2@@ ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium @-@ chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preservatives , which results in a solution with a conc@@ ession of about 25 mg / ml of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed .

the resulting solution is clear and colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ calorie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take all@@ i and do not receive weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , resulting in a quarter of the fats taken with the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ine .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to placebo in 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received 4@@ 60 mg total weight after one year had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 showed no weight loss for patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with stu@@ cco , stool , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , outlet o@@ ily secre@@ tions ( fa@@ zes ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in gra@@ ft patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women and nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the placing of orders for or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i should not be used by children and young people under 18 , because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is resor@@ bed only minim@@ ally , no adaptation of the dosage is necessary for elderly people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in • Treatment of chronic mal@@ absorption ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ vent time ( see Section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adapted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional precau@@ tionary measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
when applying War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the quick values ( international normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at for up to 4 full years , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take supplements of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the addition of a one @-@ time dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a small number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time have observed a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are linked to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials involving or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) .
the frequency of known adverse events determined after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies in humans and animals , it is possible to proceed from a rapid recovery of possible systemic effects caused by the properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect sets in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine rem@@ nants of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ a .
clinical studies have shown that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , inhi@@ bit absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times daily in combination with hypo@@ cal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and the proportion of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average total cholesterol in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2,4 % ( bas@@ eline 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value of 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg of or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected only spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ ton@@ ear@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after fis@@ sion of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ cine group ) , were identified in a study with obes@@ e patients presenting approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans .

these side effects generally occur within the first weeks of the treatment , since at this time you might not have consistently reduced the amount of fat in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize diet @-@ related side effects : • Start a few days or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take each meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial dessert , as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not use any medication after the exp@@ iry date given on the box . • Do not store over 25 ° C • The container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swallow this in any case . • You can take your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) which is included in this package .

obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • Blood pressure • Diabetes - Cardi@@ ovascular disease • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis do not talk to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
a permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a beneficial effect on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as indication of food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume each day .
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended intake of fat in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
the amount of calories that is appropriate for you can be found below , which indicates the number of calories that are appropriate for you . • D@@ ue to the mode of operation of the capsule , compliance with recommended fat intake is essential .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat .
by maintaining the recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related side effects . • You should try to gradually lose weight .
34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight approximately 0.5 kg per week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you burn up stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Middle physical activity &quot; means that you exercise 150 k@@ cal per day , i.e. through 3 km walk , 30 to 45 minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic calories and fat targets and respect them . • It is a nutritional diary with information on calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ ory and fat showers and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and reach your target weight .
alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) as well as in chemotherapy , which are moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic agent ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended since there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chemotherapy , strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 from 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 out of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 from 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . , a permit for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of cancer .
the effectiveness of al@@ op@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy .
as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable with simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to undergo such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not intended to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron un@@ ham@@ pered the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics examined against tumors ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron dose and a Ste@@ ady @-@ St@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population showed that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ i@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hal@@ operi@@ dol , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women , unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical trials , the most common side effects of a dose of 250 micro@@ grams were reported ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) who were at least related to Alo@@ xi , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration of administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ effects @-@ relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective in case of an al@@ op@@ xi@@ r over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 100 mg dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life period of 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously at day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy containing ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously at day 1 .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
following clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out by 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
following an intraven@@ ous application , an initial decrease of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ ally half @-@ value of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients .
according to the intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) mean increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that the overall position measured at once daily intraven@@ ous injection of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to that measured after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ time dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , are involved in the enzymes of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams per kilogra@@ m &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as imm@@ utable active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
the total body size was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min after a single intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection in healthy eyes .
although in patients with severe liver dysfunction , terminal exclusion is increased and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is increased , but this does not justify a reduction of the dose .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were only observed after expos@@ ures , which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , indications have shown that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose equivalent to about 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high doses and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ off use , the relevance of these results is considered to be low for the human being .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report recommen@@ ding the failure to approve the use of the drugs intended for the treatment of hepatitis C with Al@@ ph@@ e@@ 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; refer@@ enced medical drug &quot; ) .
al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease called by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic investigation , the liver tissue damages damage , furthermore , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood are abnormal .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) has been inj@@ ected into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon producer showed data demonstrating the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon was compared to the efficacy of the reference medicine to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided for the CH@@ MP recommendation to prohi@@ bit the placing of the market ?
in addition , concerns were expressed in the absence of sufficient data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ e@@ and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
after the treatment with al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon , the disease was again fl@@ amed for more patients than with the refer@@ ral drug ; furthermore , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug establishes an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , is not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( crack or cutting wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ ed@@ ged wounds .
alt@@ ar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been det@@ ectable or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because of this kind of infection may not work .
alt@@ ar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the surface area to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) , thereby inhibit@@ ing the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was sub@@ lim@@ ated at the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were examined in skin wounds , approximately 90 % of patients in both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infection caused or presumably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect associated with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed between 1 and 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the job site .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment out@@ weigh the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wed wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . , a permit for placing alt@@ ar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy may be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation by using the re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of retin@@ os@@ in@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient in clinical trials .
alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical pharmaceuticals is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ imp@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After the same oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on sk@@ imp@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustments are not considered necessary when topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate with regard to a statement on the effects on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
during pregnancy Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used when a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / ended , the benefit of breast@@ feeding should be weighed down for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the date of administration that concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase center .
through binding to this binding site , poly@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions , and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance the application of retin@@ am@@ ulin at least appear question@@ able in some forms of infection , advice should be sought by experts .
no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ am@@ ulin were found opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and weakened skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % retreat twice a day for 5 days to topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 with the adult patients each before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake of people after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ imp@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP escap@@ ement .
metabolism in vitro oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ism in human liver micro@@ waves was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , lower participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of changes in liver and thy@@ roid disorders .
in @-@ vitro @-@ examination for gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymp@@ ho@@ oma test respectively in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in the rat micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo study chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus achieving up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ inn@@ ed skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( in accordance with the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development sto@@ ic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged one to 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can be completed .
if a refresh dose is desired for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( body &apos;s natural def@@ ences ) , as it can defend against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and generates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix also contains the same components as the approved vaccine of Twin@@ rix adults since 1996 and the approved vaccine of Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult contain identical ingredients , some of the data supporting the application of Twin@@ rix adult were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional 20@@ 8 children study , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix led between 98 % and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations of hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protecting atmosphere at a six @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections was similar .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ur@@ eness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission informed the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smi@@ th@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals , p.@@ a. a permit for placing ambient atmosphere in the whole
the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ mor@@ dial imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses of vacc@@ ines , the first dose at the date of the election and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refresh rate is desired for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody @-@ based anti @-@ hepatitis B ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies have the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immuno@@ competent individuals who have responded to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination will need a re@@ fres@@ her as protection , since they may be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA @-@ units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and people with dys@@ functions of the immune system , under certain circumstances , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody is reached , so that in these cases the administration of further vacc@@ ines can be required .
since an intra@@ muscular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the but@@ to@@ cks could lead to a sub@@ optimal outcome , these injection methods should be avoided .
however , with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , however , ambi@@ quit@@ os can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine , the immune response was adequate to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it is necessary to assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ch@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ sal and preserv@@ ative form@@ ative formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 imm@@ ac@@ ulate doses of Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s compatibility with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine was compared .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ urities on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose of Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects receiving the ambi@@ x reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ter@@ ity was comparable to each pro@@ band ( i.e. , across the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects receiving the ambi@@ x compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and wear@@ iness was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ination , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ent@@ x@@ group was similar to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA @-@ units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
statisti@@ cally , the percentage of vaccine that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A units and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted in vaccine trials at the age of 1 to including 15 years , serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted between 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA @-@ units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were at the time of prim@@ acy between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study from 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme to that of the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year at the same time coinci@@ ded with the re@@ fres@@ her creation of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for the current formulation as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ en@@ sion on possible foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state charge release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as swimming in contaminated waters .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix may not fully protect from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus prior to serving both doses of vaccine ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) , an allergic reaction to your child .
an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you quickly want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination card ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from an ino@@ cul@@ ation with ambi@@ x .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes ambi@@ x is spra@@ yed in people suffering from severe co@@ agulation disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s def@@ ences , or if you / your child is undergoing a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to the vaccine may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the response to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / your child will take / take other medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / has received / or is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambi@@ x , it should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as different limbs .
if ambi@@ x is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , ambi@@ x pregnant or breast@@ feeding women are not administered unless it is urgently necessary to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
please let your doctor know if you have an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very frequently ( more than 1 case per 10 t@@ apped cans ) : • pain or discomfort on the spot or redness • mat@@ ch@@ iness • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
smoking frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 de@@ mented cans ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • ligh@@ the@@ aded • gastro@@ intestinal complaints
other side effects that have been reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 le@@ aked doses ) are :
these include locally restricted or extended r@@ ashes that may be it@@ ching or bul@@ b@@ ous , swelling of the eye area and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .
flu @-@ like complaints , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , ab@@ norm@@ alities such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ant running , &quot; multiple sclerosis , diseases of the optic nerve , loss of sensation or ten@@ acity of some body parts , strong headaches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions
f@@ ain@@ ting inflammation of some blood vessels is mal@@ aise or feeling of illness , loss of appetite , diar@@ rho@@ ea , and abdominal pain , liver function tests , increased tendency to ble@@ ed@@ ings or bru@@ ising ( bru@@ ises ) caused by rub@@ b@@ ish of the blood plat@@ el@@ et .
23 inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child significantly affects or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this package .
ambi@@ x is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which has become known since the issu@@ ance of the first authorization for the placing of the market , the CH@@ MP has agreed that the benefits @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was put into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ ade can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defects or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ aps - split by several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al tube ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , as Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without active substance ) .
Am@@ mon@@ ade can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal levels of acid in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste sa@@ version , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
Am@@ mon@@ ade was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the disease &apos;s r@@ arity at the time of approval , only limited information was available for this drug .
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme shortage has already been manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a delayed @-@ retard@@ ant form ( incomplete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is then an indication for the use , if there is hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form .
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early lack of carb@@ am@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency have to receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk of the formation of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets do not reach the stomach immediately .
each tablet contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20@@ g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma associated clinical states .
since the metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate takes place over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , ne@@ ural reproduction and increased neur@@ onal loss were slow@@ ed down .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve lesi@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it is not possible to determine if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least one un@@ desired event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of patients and 78 % of those adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal woman who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10@@ g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg per day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabol@@ ically active compound , which is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
p@@ us@@ chi@@ omet@@ rically seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to produce sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate recorded for each gram of 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pre@@ diction of the early manifestation of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ used , and the disease itself led to death in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative routes of nit@@ ro@@ genous ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diets and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life month ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and who were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a delayed manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous shape of the Or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even during treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is known to be oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were measured after administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ ine metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis after individual release as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected 15 minutes after taking .
in the majority of patients with leak@@ age @-@ cycle disorders or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in the plasma next morning after overnight fast .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion This medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine above the kidneys .
after the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses had no apparent effects ( investigation 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children not yet able to swallow tablets , or patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al tube .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg per day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and adolescents and adults .
the concentration of am@@ moni@@ ac , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early lack of carb@@ am@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20@@ g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat tur@@ tles were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , lesi@@ ons in the pyrami@@ ds of the brain cor@@ tex occurred .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal woman who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
p@@ us@@ chi@@ omet@@ rically seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess .
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate of 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ate can be produced for each gram .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ulate form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected within 15 minutes .
during the duration of the durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the mean measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medication over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate after eating proteins in the body .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headaches , taste disturbances , dimin@@ ution of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or in the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating an appropriate treatment .

angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , decreased blood flow to heart ) , for instance in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients receiving a PCI , a higher dose is administered and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on AC@@ S treatment , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination of he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during PCI , patients often received a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent the closure ) and they received additional medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as c@@ anti@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without administration of G@@ PI - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year .
in patients receiving a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in regarding all indicators except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine , or any of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in in the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to approve the placing of angi@@ ox in the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ heart attack inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of an emergency intervention , or if early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous feed of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if an additional PCI is performed in the patient , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
a bolt @-@ release of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered immediately before the procedure , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous clamping of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an all@@ otted Bol@@ us administration of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt transfer of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before use and the bol@@ us dose can be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , further surveillance is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI function ( whether treated with Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din against AC@@ S or not ) .
if the ACT @-@ value lies below 225 seconds , a second one @-@ stroke dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bol@@ us dose should be examined again .
in patients with severe kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which were used for approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the Bi@@ vali@@ ent@@ ine @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the end of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in , or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against Hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hypertension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for patients with di@@ aly@@ sis
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if in PCI @-@ patients with bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din most hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges on arter@@ ial point @-@ points occur , in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ onal intervention ( PCI ) , bleeding can in principle occur everywhere .
in patients who are treated war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( international standard of norm@@ ative ratio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ din is again reached prior to the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ated inhibit@@ ors ) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters can be controlled regularly .
the animal experiments are insufficient with regard to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients more than 65 years of age were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently among bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ ogra@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- inhibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
AC@@ U@@ ITY serious hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ at@@ oma with radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , hem@@ at@@ oma with ≥ 3 g / dl of well known hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels , re@@ operation due to ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points of point , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following data on adverse events are based on data from a clinical trial with a bi@@ vali@@ din in 6,000 patients who have undergone a PCI study .
both in the bi@@ vali@@ ant group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients more than 65 years of age were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently among bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after comprehensive use and are group@@ ed according to system categories in Table 6 .
in case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ din is to be stopped immediately and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and on the an@@ ion cor@@ ing region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in irrespective of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is reversible , because in its part , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active center of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din assisted the serum of patients with a Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past .
in healthy subjects and in patients , bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect that is supported by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed in the patients below , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the procedure is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lever inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in Arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or in the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were spread evenly across the 3 arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or elevated cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent within 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require insulin treatment .
A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , upper th@@ igh or upper arm or administered as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot effectively process insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is very slightly different from the insulin analog , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lis@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in human body insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the ingredients , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that may affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH approval for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , th@@ igh or del@@ to@@ id or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdominal wall .
due to the reduced glucose absorption capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with reduced liver function .
any change of the active force , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in the insulin requirement .
3 An inadequate dosage or dis@@ continuation of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the timing of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change during the change of the treatment scheme .
among the substances that increase the blood sugar lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia are oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , Dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , Fi@@ br@@ ate , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ stimulation can be weakened or missing under the effect of sympath@@ ic agents such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ dine and reser@@ pine .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ oids regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but insulin is generally not absorbed into breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application .
in the following , the adverse drug reactions reported from clinical studies are group@@ ed according to system categories and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 10 ; often : ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ; not known ( frequency based on available data ) .

li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is missed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , can occur in the sequence a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
after glu@@ co@@ agulation , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the causes of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in case of a sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of is@@ is@@ is@@ ine the effect occurs faster and the duration of active insulin is shorter than with hu@@ - and normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin sensitivity in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosing range of 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional up@@ take effect , and at 0.3 e / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ en@@ ic effect , just like human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ es@@ hip effect approximately 2 hours earlier than the human insulin .
from the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a similar post@@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human body insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ den@@ si@@ al control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as in the normal insulin regulator , which is given 2 r@@ ents before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal in comparison to normal insulin regulator , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and in comparison to normal insulin regulator , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was administered 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to normal insulin regulator , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
