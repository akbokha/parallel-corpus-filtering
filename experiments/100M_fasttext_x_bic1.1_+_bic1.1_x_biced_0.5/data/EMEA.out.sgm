<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package insert (also included in the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you require further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of enamel tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for inhalation (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirelessly thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things which are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental disorder whereby the patient may have varying periods of abnormal mood alternately with periods of normal atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbance if oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution for taking or the enamel tablets can be used in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This interferes with the transmission of signals between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is believed to be primarily a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazl acts like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazl helps to normalize brain activity, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients in whom the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest with which of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the enamel tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients receiving Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms than the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">For up to 74 weeks, Abilify also prevented placebo regaining manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled socks), nausea (drowsiness), nausea, vomiting, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness (increased saliva production), drowsiness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episodes in patients with predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes responded to treatment with Aripiprazl were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes responded to treatment with Aripiprazl (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy of doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazl (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results from an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicide risk associated with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, conduction disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including active and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, occasional reports were reported during the treatment with Aripiprazole dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia treated with Abilify should be considered to reduce the dose or to break down treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unequivocally high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazl in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazl had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and addressing for undesired cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no exact risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydiptic, polyurry, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to combating dities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazl on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with superior side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (chinidine) increased the AUC from Aripiprazl by 107% while CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and should therefore be carried out similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">For CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisation.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint administration of ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3P inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and should therefore be carried out similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After settling the CYP2D6 or 3A4-inhibitor the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be expected to increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazl showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine-Ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used during pregnancy due to the lack of data for safety in humans and due to the concerns that arise in the reproductive studies of the animal, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative effect on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: often (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks, patients treated with Aripiprazl showed a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Maisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study lasting 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in people suffering from Aripiprazl and 13,1% in people under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study lasting 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazl was 15.1% in patients with Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disruption - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23,5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in people suffering from Aripiprazl and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term study period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and Placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters appeared, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">CPK increases (creatine phase kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazl compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Adverse events associated with an anti-psychotic therapy and the occurrence associated with Aripiprazl include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and elevated mortality in elderly patients with dementia, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazl alone were observed in adult patients with estimated dosages of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose, as Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D-2 and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and the serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergigen and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the application of Aripiprazl in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks in healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, at the nucleus caudatus and in the putative.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents who attended the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measured scales, which were defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl showed a significantly higher reduction in the relapse rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazl group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an ooooine-controlled, multinational double blind study with schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazl showed a efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazl showed a placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12, Aripiprazole also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic traits, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazl showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl before randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar response, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the expansion and hydroxymethylation of Aripiprazl, the N-Dealkyness is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination of ellipses is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl for extensive metabolisation (CYP2D6) and nearly 146 hours at 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as did a pharmacokinetic study of schizophrenic patients with no gender dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">An exposure-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics did not indicate clinically significant differences in the ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazl were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with varying liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazl, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were only observed in case of dosages or exposures that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have only limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent secondary kidney disease (Lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equal to 3 to 10 times the middle Steady State exposure (AUC) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the average Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of hydrogen sulfate conjugates in the gene of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulfate conjugates found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of hydroxy- Aripiprazl did not enter more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of 3- and 11x of the middle Steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="143">Abilify injection solution is used to quickly check aggitibility and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="144">Once clinically appropriate, the treatment should be terminated with Aripiprazl injection solution and begin with the oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">To increase the absorption and minimize variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended while bypassing adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical condition taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acutely treatment (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify's enamel tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution in patients with aggidity and behavioural disorders that were otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of the bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines in addition to the Aripiprazl injection solution is deemed necessary, patients should be observed in case of extreme sedation or blood pressure loss (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Research on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution is not available to patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (by prescribing or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, conduction disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including active and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, occasional reports were reported during the treatment with Aripiprazole dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and heart rhythm disorders).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydiptic, polyuretic, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect and may lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was larger compared with the allotted administration of Aripiprazl, in a study in which healthy volunteers Aripiprazl (15 mg dose) was used as one-off intramuscularly and who simultaneously received Loracepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist FAMI, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') Metabolism can result in the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteasinhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After settling the CYP2D6 or 3A4-inhibitor the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose level prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 lauazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of the sedation was larger compared to that after the sole administration of Aripiprazole.</seg>

<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study lasting 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in people under Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in people under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in people under Aripiprazol- treatment was 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term study period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazl treatment was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and Placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters appeared, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">CPK increases (creatinphosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazl compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The adverse events associated with an anti-psychotic therapy and the occurrence associated with Aripiprazl include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and elevated mortality in older patients with dementia, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disturbances was the Aripiprazole injection solution with statistically significant greater improvements of aggitibility / behavioural problems associated with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 hours) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as aggidity and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms regarding the apprehensions and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- Reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean recovery from baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score in the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe asgibility, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents who attended the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measured scales, which were defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a significantly higher reduction in the relapse rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an ooooine-controlled, multinational double blind study with schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic traits, which were partially due to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazl showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl before randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to placebo in regards to the prevention of bipolar feedback, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection the Aripiprazl AUC is 90% bigger than the AUC after administration of the same dose as tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy subjects, the mean time until the maximum plasma level was reached at 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripiprazl injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15 and 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after intravenous application there were no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29-times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazl (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicological significant effects were only observed in case of dosages or exposures that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans; therefore, they have only limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal cortex toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equal to 3 to 10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of hydrogen sulfate conjugates in the gene of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81-times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters used to receive an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (as a single dose or as a monotherapy) was compared with the drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, 72 (31%) of 229 patients treated with Abraxane were treated to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Only patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer were not able to distinguish between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deteriorating disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before or before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective in patients in whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel and that it does not have to be given with other drugs in contrast to other paclitaxel drugs in order to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the placing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing treatment is not indicated (see also Section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women in childbearing age, who do not practice effective contraception, except the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women of childbearing age should apply a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to do no child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised prior to the treatment of a sperm count since the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects like fatigue (very common) and dizziness (often), which can affect the perspiration and ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and major incidents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer that were treated once every three weeks at 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal phase III trial.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Listed in Table 1 are the side effects associated with the application of Abraxane as monotherapy for every dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burn, dry mouth, toothed pulp, loose stool, oesophagitis, sores in the mouth, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of musculature, genital pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in the skeletal musculature, flange pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no causal correlation with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules active substance that promotes the storage of microtubules from the tubulae and stabilises the microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization results in an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital Interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transential transport is mediated by the gp-60 Albumreceptor and occurs due to the albuminbinding protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the tumor area.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two non-randomised trials and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multi-centric study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received paclitaxel within 3 weeks, either in the form of a solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour transfusion with premedication for the prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only due to metastasis and 19% due to metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First-Line therapy are below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity vis-à-vis paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy degree 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to decay at baseline based on the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Active Exposure Exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 following the addition of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravascularisation and / or soft tissue binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving advanced solid tumours the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane were compared with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg. / m2 of solvent-based paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">Paclitaxel clearance was higher (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the volume of distribution was higher (53%) at Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="321">In published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolised to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in people with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative absorption of the unchanged ingredient was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data have been available to patients at the age of more than 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light light protected over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic medicine and as well as other potentially toxic substances, precautions should be observed when handling Abraxane.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicinal product approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called "referenced drug").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood cancers, in which complications may occur in connection with blood transfusion, if a blood donor is not possible prior to the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with disorders that the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donors, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be monitored before treatment to ensure that iron deficiency is not present, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by an erythropoietindeficiency or by preventing the body from responding adequately to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced that enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">When administered as an injection into a vein as part of a major study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems anaemia, Abseamed was compared with the reference medicine.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo for at least eight weeks before they were either encapsulated or continued Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of leamed dissamed with those of Eprex / Erypo were studied in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems, hemoglobin values were maintained in the same degree as those who continued Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stinging migraine-like headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this will not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the evidence provided for Abseamed according to the European Union regulations proved that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that manufactures seamed is provided for the medical specialist in all member states information packages, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted the company Medice pharmaceuticals Pütter GmbH & Co KG a licence for the placing of dissenamed in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion needs in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma which receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (for example cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia in the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], if bleeding-saving measures are not available or inadequate, with planned major surgical procedures which require a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">To reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be used before a large electro-orthopedic surgery in adults without iron deficiency, where a high risk of transfusion compensations is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml may be applied, which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for paediatric patients, in which the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anaemia symptoms and as a result may vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed over or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve hemoglobin target concentrations of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is prescribed in the lowest approved dose needed for controlling anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results suggest that patients with a very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with a very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Initial dose: 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired goal is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anemia symptoms and subsequent changes may vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve hemoglobin target concentrations of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is prescribed in the lowest approved dose needed to control the anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the hemoglobin value has increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the Retidal number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to baseline, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the Retidal number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl are increased compared to the baseline, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the repeal cell number has increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose should be maintained by 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">On the other hand, the hemoglobin value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) resp. the Retidal number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline value, is an indication of the epoetin-alfa therapy unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%) in which the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood canned blood is required should be received twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery in a dose of 600 I.E. / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should be started as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the onset of the autologous blood donation program - large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the second streamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6. recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of dialysis can be given via the hose of a fistula, followed by 10 ml isotonic salt solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who develop an erythroblastomenie (PRCA) under the treatment with any erythropoetin (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive abseamed or any other erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastomenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment, instabile angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thromboses (e.g. anamnestic known venous thromboemboils).</seg>
<seg id="409">Patients with a larger elective orthopaedic surgery and who cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program are contraindicated by the use of epoetin alfa in the following pre-, accompanying or general diseases: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the carotid or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred cardiac infarction or cerebrovascular accident.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomenia (PRCA) Very rarely has been reported about the occurrence of an anti-body-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of action defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the Retiulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes of failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminumtoxification, infection or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the recurrence rate is lower, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the Retiulocytes "Index"), thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other cause of a loss of action is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow is considered to be considered a diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk for an anti-body-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that can be attributed to the gift of epoetine when the haemoglobin concentration is increased over the concentration needed to control the anemia symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the haemoglobin target concentration below Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to current findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">A 2-3-week delay between epoetin-alfa and erythropoetin response should be taken into account in tumour patients receiving chemotherapy (patients who may have to be translatched).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2, in order to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dose adjustment with the goal of keeping haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are foreseen for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, the cause of anaemia before the onset of epoetin-alfa therapy should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a larger elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate prophylactic prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial haemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl, an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events can exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetine was not shown to improve overall survival in tumor patients with symptomatic anemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy had a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5-8.7 mmol / l)</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with iclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the ciclosporin dose should be adjusted to the increasing haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebral thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, pulmonary thromboses, retinal arthromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidney were reported in patients with erythropoetin treatment, so also patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients treated with erythropoetins.</seg>
<seg id="433">Irrespective of erythropoetin treatment, there may be thrombotic and vascular complications in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations.</seg>
<seg id="434">Epoetin alfa is glycolic and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydrate content with the endogenous human erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates the erythropoiesis and does not influence leukopoesis.</seg>
<seg id="436">389 patients with hemoblastomosis (221 multiple myelomas, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and 24 other hemoblastocysis) and 332 patients with solid tumours (172 breast carcinomas, 64 gynecological tumors, 22 prostate carcinomas, 21 gastrointestinal carcinomas, and 30 other malignancies).</seg>

<seg id="438">Survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 2833 patients; four of these studies were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and</seg>
<seg id="439">In the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and the control patients.</seg>
<seg id="440">In these studies, patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin showed a significantly higher mortality rate than in the controls due to various precombinant human erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="441">Overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thromboses and associated complications in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and in controls.</seg>
<seg id="442">There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events in tumor patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and a negative impact on overall survival can not be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is not clear how far these results are transferred to the use of recombinant human erythropoetin in tumor patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hemoglobin value below 13 g / dl, since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data.</seg>
<seg id="444">Epoetin-alfa-determinations after repeated IV application showed a half-life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a somewhat prolonged half-life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="445">After subcutaneous injection, the serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than serum levels following intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="446">There is no cumulation: serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift.</seg>
<seg id="447">Bone marrow fibrosis is a well-known complication of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.</seg>
<seg id="448">In a study of hemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for three years, the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased compared to the control group with dialysis patients who were not treated with epoetin alfa.</seg>

<seg id="567">Aclasta is used to treat the following diseases: • Osteoporosis (a disease which makes the bones become brittle) in women after menopause as well as in men.</seg>
<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high risk of fracture (fractures), including those who have recently suffered a minor traumatic hernia like in the eye; • Morbus Paget of bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment; patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) before the first infusion or by injection into a muscle.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (remedy against inflammation) shortly after the application of Aclasta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following the infusion such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>
<seg id="571">In order to treat the disease, Aclasta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who had recently undergone a hip fracture; the number of fractures over a period of up to five years has been studied.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies in 357 patients and compared to six months with risedronate (another bisphosphonate).</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkaline phosphatase content in serum (an enzyme that builds bone substance) normalized in the blood or decreased by at least 75% compared to the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of vertebrate fractures in patients under Aclasta (without other osteoporosis therapies) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis therapies).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study of men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most Aclasta side effects occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledron acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion place and osteoneclosis (loss of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides explanations for doctors who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, the evidence of how to apply the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to Novartis Europharm Limited for the marketing of Aclasta across the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="586">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men with an increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include: • Contra-indication in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non smoking and healthy nutrition • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When referring to medical or nursing help</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women in men with an increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men intravenous 5 mg aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">Following treatment with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of orally or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta may be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the use of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney dysfunction (see Section 4.4) For patients with a Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents, Aclasta, are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, as data for safety and efficacy are lacking.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokaltsmia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the onset of treatment with Aclasta (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop due to the rapid insertion of the effect of zoledron acid on bone reconstruction, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be considered before an application of bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who require dental surgery, no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical review by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta may be reduced by administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of adverse events reported as serious adverse events in patients who received Aclasta increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients who received placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">Osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) were the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%).</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney dysfunction Zoledronic acid was associated with kidney function disorders, which expressed itself as a decrease of kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The changes in the Kreatinin Clearance (measured annually before administration) and the incidence of kidney failure as well as a restricted renal function were in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years comparable between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, transient asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), showed up to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the patients treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received supplementary adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently acquired hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of zoledron acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the infusion place such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area was reported mainly in cancer patients, via osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Study with 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the jaw area in a patient with Aclasta and placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of an overdose which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in postmenopausal women (7,736 women aged 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) -T-Score for the enkelhal ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral structure.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric vertebral body fractures Aclasta lowered significantly over a period of three years and after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebral body fractures (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60% reduction in the risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effect on hip fractures Aclasta showed a constant effect over three years resulting in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) risk of hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar vertebraic acid, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9% increase in bone density of lumbar spine by 6.7%, total hip by 6.0%, butt neck by 5.1% and the distal radius of 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology with 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken from the pelvic crest a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies.</seg>
<seg id="628">In comparison to placebo, a microcomputer-ographic (µCT) analysis showed an increase in trabecular bone volume and the preservation of trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone turnover highs The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-telopeptid (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta reduced BSAP by 30% compared to the baseline and was kept at 28% below the baseline value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the baseline until 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.E. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality rate was 10% (101 patients) in the placebo group treated with Aclasta, compared to 13% (141 patients).</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased the BMD at all points of time compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment resulted in a 5.4% increase in BMD over 24 months compared to placebo, and 4.3% of the total weight of the femur.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in the clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of acetlasta was not inferior to the once-weekly administration of Alendronat for the percentage change of lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment at the Paget of the bone Aclasta was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, especially mild to moderately heavy Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase in accordance with the 2.5 to 3,0x age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledron acid in comparison to taking 30 mg periedronate once a day for 2 months was proven in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for Aclasta and Risedronate.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month study were included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with Aclasta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response was maintained at 141 of patients treated with Aclasta, compared to 71 of the patients treated with Risedronate.</seg>
<seg id="645">Single and multiple 5 and 15 minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long phase of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic vanishing from the large cycle with half-life times t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ -1,87 hours followed by a prolonged exclusion period with a terminal elimination time t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of distribution (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total-body clearance is independent of the dose of 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of metabolised substances with cytochrom-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely, because zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin Clearance, and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney dysfunction up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the zoledron acid required.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since severe kidney dysfunction (Kreatinous Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) is limited to data, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-consecutive single-dose intravenous single dose amounted to 10mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In trials of dogs, single doses of 1,0 mg / kg (based on AUC, which were 6 times the recommended humane-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Sub-chronic and chronic toxicity In trials with intravenous application the renal tolerability of zoledronic acid in rats was administered intravenously, taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, administered in intervals of 2-3 weeks (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7x the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in cumulated expositions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as the intravenous injection point appeared.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common finding in repeated applications was an increase in primary Spongiosa in the metaphor of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats were observed with teratogenicity in dosages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such as skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed on rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was less than 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a representative of a class of substances called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, for osteoporosis in men and the disease Paget of bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens, which are made of androgens, play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass seen in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In Paget's disease bone reconstruction is done too fast, and new bone material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalizing the bone structure, ensuring a normal bone formation and thus reinvigorating the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you use Aclasta with other medicines please inform your doctor, pharmacist or the nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="677">For your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using Aclasta along with foods and drinks, you are concerned that according to your doctor's instructions, you will have sufficient liquid before and after treatment with Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="681">The usual dose is 5 mg, which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as infusion into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="682">As Aclasta is working for a long time, you may need to take another dose after one year or more.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">With Morbus Paget, Aclasta may work longer than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="685">If you miss the administration of Aclasta, please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment.</seg>
<seg id="686">Before completing the therapy with Aclasta Falls you should consider the termination of the treatment with Aclasta, please take your next doctor's appointment and discuss this with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Adverse events related to the first infusion occur very frequently (in more than 30% of patients), but are less common after subsequent infusion.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headache, appear within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="689">It is currently unclear whether Aclasta causes this irregular heartbeat, but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="730">In a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes (Serenade), the absolute change in the HbA1c value (with a baseline of 7.9% for both groups) was -0.8 for Rimonabant 20 mg and -0.3 under placebo</seg>
<seg id="731">The percentage of patients who reached a HbA1c- value of &lt; 7% was 51% in the Rimonabant group and 35% in the placebo group.</seg>

<seg id="734">Reached 2 hours, the Steady State plasma levels were achieved after 13 days (CMAx = 196 ± 28,1 ng / ml; Ctrough = 91,6 ± 14.1 ng / ml; AUC0-24 = 2960 ± 268 ng.h / ml).</seg>
<seg id="735">Influence of food: the subjects receiving Rimonabant either in a sobriety state or after a fat-rich meal, exhibited a 67% increase in CMAx respectively by 48% in case of food intake.</seg>
<seg id="736">Patients with black skin color can have up to 31% lower CMAx and a 43% lower AUC than patients of other ethnic populations.</seg>
<seg id="737">N popular Pharmacokinetic Analysis (age range 18- 81 years) is estimated that a 75- year-old patient has a 21% higher CMAx and a 27% higher AUC than a 40-year-old</seg>

<seg id="749">The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Review (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients) in which metformin (a diabetic medicine) is not indicated. • It can be used together with another diabetesmedication (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (in particular overweight patients), metformin can not be adjusted satisfactorily with metformin alone in the highest acceptable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonyluorum or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonyluorum or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos in triple therapy was studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylurea, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triple therapy study, the effect of the additional administration of acetone for existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylurea showed a reduction of HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of actos and insulin in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin had a decrease in HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients receiving additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothalamanesthesia (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos can neither be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of ketone - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos in the course of a monotherapy (in the sole use) should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients in which metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit for placing an account within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the marker "15" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the treatment of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk due to the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should begin treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac safety.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outflow study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced macular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports on heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased starting liver enzyme levels (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme levels are to be controlled again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazone should be conducted until the laboratory parameters have been determined by clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain was demonstrated, which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution a slight reduction of the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the treatment with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparing controlled trials with Pioglitazone in patients with metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobins by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3.1% and hematoglobins by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients receiving pioglitazone as oral two-fold or triple combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, treatment with thiazolidindiones, including Pioglitazone, was reported on a occurrence or worsening of a diabetic macular edema with a decrease in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear if there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribed physicians should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is deprecated (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies evaluating the interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazon by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in AUC from Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the reduced insulin resistance of the mother animal under treatment with Pioglitazone and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequently &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not invaluable in this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the tumor and refraction index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone ALT-ascents were often the same as in placebo, but less frequently than in comparison groups under Metformin or Sulfonyharnstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced macular disease, the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than placebo if Pioglitazone or Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported about cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazone, but more often when Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac insufficiency in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical studies was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients treated with comparisons of comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study, which runs over a period of 3.5 years, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not occur any symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an activated activated receptor-γ activation (PPAR-γ) activated by the activation of specific nuclear receptors (PPAR-γ). this leads to increased insulin sensitivity in liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the onset of the therapy, a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazon in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of improvement with insulin were randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, Pioglitazone consistently showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin ratio compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetics in a small study of 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol and low but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced overall plasmatogenesis and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or gliclazid and increased the HDL cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels was observed under Pioglitazon, while reduced values were observed under Metformin and Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone discounted not only the triglycerides but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride levels, which both have an effect on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglycerides synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outflow study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced macular disease were randomised in groups who received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is quickly resorbed, with the top concentrations of unmodified Pioglitazone in the plasma usually reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to effectiveness in roughly the triple of effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it has been proven that pioglitazone does not have a relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in the wood (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination period of unmodified Pioglitazon amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and that of the total active metabolites is 16-23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral Clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies were consistent with mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume increase with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the reduced insulin resistance of the mother animal under treatment with Pioglitazone and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the bladder was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolidindiones led to increased frequency of colonic tumors.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were investigated with both Pioglitazone or Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials for more than 1 year, Pioglitazone consistently showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin ratio compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone discounted not only the triglycerides but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride levels, which both have an effect on Tryglyceride absorption and hepatic Tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the target of its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the overall mortal, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary artery disease, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary revascularization and revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with taking Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "45" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who were treated with Pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients who received comparative medication, increased incidence of bone fractures in women demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone discounted not only the triglycerides but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, which both have an effect on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglycerides synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actrophane was studied in 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use the insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actrophane resulted in a decrease in the HbA1c level suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered similar to that of another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actrophane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of actraphane must be adjusted if it is given together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the package).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of actraphane were outweighed in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted Novo Nordisk A / S authorisation for the placing of Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily, when rapid initial action along with a longer lasting effect is desired.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient may not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union, the company presented data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15 week treatment, the proportion of low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who took alendronate alone (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data that suggests that the alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headache, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (ulcera), flatulence (ulcera) of the esophagus, dysphagia (swallowing), detained abdomen (bloated stomach), and sour upset.</seg>
<seg id="1283">ADROVANCE may not be used in patients with allergic hypersensitivity to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It may not be used in diseases of the oesophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1288">The following indications are to be carefully observed in order to reduce the risk of adverse reactions and associated side effects (see Section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• Patients should not chew the tablet with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml). • Patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth, as there is a risk of oropharyngeal Ulzera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleedings or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract except for pyloroplastic are given only under special caution (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal fractures, were reported in patients taking Alendronat (some of them were serious and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that point to possible adverse reactions, and patients should be advised to remove the medicine for symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain when swallowing or retrospectively burning the medicine and getting medical advice (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3. the risk of serious adverse events seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and continue to take it after the onset of symptoms that point to an oophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">Whereas in large-scale clinical trials with alendronat no increased risk was detected, stomach and duodenal ulcera, among them some severe and with complications, were rarely reported (see Section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1297">There are no data available that give clues as to whether the removal of bisphosphonate therapy in patients who need a slate surgical procedure reduces the risk of osteoarthritis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical assessment of the attending physician is key to therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed that when taking a dose of ADROVANCE, they should take the tablet next morning after noticing its failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled weekly day.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases that affect mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be treated appropriately before the onset of ADROVANCE therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of alendronat if taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Alendronat before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, alendronate was taken in clinical trials jointly with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions occurring.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or lactative women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>

<seg id="1319">In the phase III studies, the average ascents of BMD with alendronat 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.8% on the spine, 5.9% on the femur and 7.8% on the chanter.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the group treated with alendronate, a 48% reduction (Alendronat 3.2% compared to placebo was 6.2%) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more vertebrate fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies the ascents of the BMD of spine and trochanter continued to stop; also the BMD of the femur and the entire body was maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">Fit consisted of two placebo-controlled trials, where Alendronat was taken daily (5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg. daily for either 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily administration of alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new vertebrate fracture by 47% (Alendronat 7.9% compared to placebo -15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Resorption Based on an intravenous reference dose, the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after a night of fasting and two hours before receiving a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">The bioavailability was reduced to about 0.46% and 0.39% if Alendronat was taken one or half an hour before a standardised breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis studies, Alendronat was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy subjects, the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily over five days) led to no clinically significant change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in average in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies in rats revealed that alendronate is temporarily distributed in tissue sections according to intravenous administration of 1 mg / kg, but then rapidly dispersed into the bone or excreted with urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Excretion After intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C-Alendronate, about 50% of the radioactivity were excreted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the faeces.</seg>
<seg id="1330">According to intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance ranged from Alendronat 71 ml / min and the systemic Clearance did not exceed 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">Alendronat is not excreted by the kidneys via the acid or alkaline transport system and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the excretion of other drugs by these transport systems.</seg>

<seg id="1335">Elimination of radioactively-marked vitamin D3 in healthy subjects was the median excretion of radioactivity in the urine after 48 hours 2.4% in the urine after 4 days 4.9%.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Characteristics in patients with preclinical studies have shown that the portion of alendronate, which is not stored in the bone, is quickly excreted via the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Although there is no clinical data about it, it is expected that the renal elimination of alendronate as in animal tests will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1338">For this reason, a slightly increased cumulation of alendronate in the bone is expected in patients with reduced kidney function (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1339">Alendronate non-clinical data based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, chronic toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1401">Advagraf is administered to adult patients who have transplanted kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplanted organs through the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Since tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograf are already used in the EU, the company has submitted the results from previous studies with Prograf / Prograf as well as data from published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical study were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplant, whereby the application of Advagraf was compared with Prograf / Prograf or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was repelled after a year of treatment (for example, by examining how often a new organ transplant or a reintake of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter trials were conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients with liver transplant and examined, such as Advanagraf in comparison to Prograf / Prograf taken by the body.</seg>

<seg id="1407">In patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) against tacrolimus, macrolide antibiotics (such as erythromycin) or any of the other components, advagraf may not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Patients and doctors must be cautious if other (especially some herbal) drugs are taken at the same time using advagraf as the dosage dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be appropriately adjusted accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with the immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of adverse events, including sub- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dose; changes of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the strict supervision of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of an alternative formulation, therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of advant should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood levels (see below "Recommendations).</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to advagraf, the Tacrolimus Talks should be checked before the changeover and over two weeks after changeover.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a level mirror, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Meticulous and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus Talking level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplants under Advagraf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate nighttransplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a low-clearance compound, an adjustment of the advance dose can take several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1419">If the patient's condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral consumption of drugs, the Tacrolimus Treatment can be administered intravenously (Prograf 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an infusion solution) with a dose of ca.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Duration of the application During the suppression of the graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advanagraf therapy should start at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustment may later be necessary, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change during the course of the patient's stabilization after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advanagraf therapy should start at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - switch from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted from two daily dose of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraf, so this conversion has to take place at a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg) to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After a change from other immunosuppressiva to advant once a day, the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for prophylaxis of graft rejection has to begin with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients who are converted to advagraf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg per day is taken once a day once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other recipients, although there is no clinical experience with advagraf in pulmonary, pankreas- and colon transplants, was used in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, with pankre-transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustment in specific patient groups patients with limited hepatic function To maintain blood thalates in the targeted area may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders to reduce the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Kidney function Since the kidney function does not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum cholesterol levels, a calculation of the creatinine office and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is advisable (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on Talking Point in Full Blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases using full-blood-tacrolimus-level controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the Tacrolimus Talking levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-level mirrors of tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to advance, dose adjustment, immunosuppressive therapy or simultaneous use of substances which could change the tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adaptations of the dose may take several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level mirrors in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the level of tacrolimus in whole blood in the first time after liver transplantations is usually in the range from 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplants, blood concentrations of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has resulted in serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects caused by tacrolimus under or over exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and daily dose; changes of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the strict supervision of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data for the retarded formulation are available.</seg>
<seg id="1442">There are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation of advagraf for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplants and graft recipients in childhood.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that may lead to a degradation of the tacrolimus in the blood and weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may be avoided or other herbal remedies during treatment with Advagraf (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is required, as the tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to significant fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, an aqueous or septum hypertrophie described as cardiomyopathy was observed, which can therefore also occur under Advanagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of malignant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES such as headache, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and visual disturbances, should be a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advagraf contains hard capsules, retarded, lactose, special caution is required in patients with the rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3P can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood levels of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the tacrolimus blood levels while simultaneously offering substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dosage accordingly to maintain uniform concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction was associated with antimycotic like ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the Macroeyelid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetical studies surrendered that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal transit.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Tacrolimus effect on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus can be metabolized with medicines, which are metabolized by CYP3A4, whose metabolism is affected.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase the exposure of hormones, decisions regarding contraceptive measures should be especially cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus can potentially decrease the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and extend their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplantation patients do not indicate that, compared to other immunosuppressants, Tacrolimus has an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible adverse effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>
<seg id="1460">There is the risk of premature birth (&lt; week 37) and a hypercalemia of newborns (incidence 8 of 111 newborns, i.e.:</seg>
<seg id="1461">The adverse event profile of immunosuppressant drugs can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines.</seg>

<seg id="1463">Ischemic disorders of coronary arteries, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac insufficiency, heart failure, myocardiopathy, chamber hypertrophy, supraventricular arrhythmias, palpitations, anomalies in the ECG, abnormal heart rate and pulse rate</seg>
<seg id="1464">Diarrhea, nausea gastrointestinal inflammatory condition, gastrointestinal ulcer and perforation, bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, stomatitis and ulceration, dyspeptic signs and symptoms, obstipation, flatulence, flatulence, bloating, looser chair, signs and symptoms in the gastrointestinal area</seg>
<seg id="1465">Infections and parasitic diseases How to be known for other highly effective immunosuppressants is often increased in patients treated with tacrolimus, susceptibility to infections (viral, bacterial, mycotic, protozoal).</seg>
<seg id="1466">Cases of BK-Virus-associated nephropathy and JC-Virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppressive therapy, including treatment with Advanagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in combination with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high bonding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialyzable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharma-dynamic effects On the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus can be mediated through its binding to a cytosolean protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cellular core.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calcium-dependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell, thereby preventing the transcription of a specific series of lymphoma genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphokines (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="1472">12 confirmed acute rejection was 32.6% within the first 24 weeks of the advance group (N = 237) and in the Prograf group (N = 234) 29.3%.</seg>
<seg id="1473">Patients survival rates after 12 months were 89.2% for Advanagraf and 90.8% for Prograf; in the Advent arm 25 (14 women, 11 men) and in the Prograf arm 24 (5 women, 19 men) were killed.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Kidney transplant The efficacy and safety of advagraf and Prograf was compared in combination with Mycophenolatmosfetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, in 667 de novo kidney transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Patients survival rates after 12 months were 96.9% for Advagraf and 97.5% for Prograf; in the Advent Arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in the Prograf arm 8 (3 women, 5 men) were killed.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The efficacy and safety of Prograf, Ciclosporin and Advagraf was compared in combination with Basiliximab, antibody production, MMF and corticosteroids, in 638 de novo kidney transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The incidence of therapy failure after 12 months (defined as death, graft failure, biopsy confirmed acute rejection or follow-up data) was 14.0% in the advance group (N = 214), 15.1% in the Prograf group (N = 212) and 17.0% in the Ciclosporin group (N = 212).</seg>
<seg id="1478">The treatment difference was -3.0% (Advent Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4.0%]) for Advanf vs Ciclosporin and -1.9% (Prograf-Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-8.9%, 5.2%]) for Prograf vs Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1479">In the Advent Arm 3 (men), in the Prograf arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in the Ciclosporin arm 6 (3 females, 3 men) death cases appeared.</seg>
<seg id="1480">Published results of primary immunosuppression with tacrolimus in the form of twice daily applied Prograf capsules after other primary organ transplants Prograf has become a recognized primary immunosuppressant after pancreatic, lung and intestinal disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1481">175-week transplant patients, in 475 patients who had undergone a pancreas transplant and were used as primary immunosuppressive in 630 cases after colon transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral program in these published studies was consistent with the large studies in which Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplant In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicenter study with oral program, more than 110 patients were reported, who were either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterato- syndrome, was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after a year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with tacrolimus, it was found in 21.7% of cases to develop a bronchiolitis of obliterans compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be converted to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients that were converted from tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was increased after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the transplantation-transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the incidence of recurrent bronchiolitis was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreas transplant A multicenter study with oral program was conducted to 205 patients who simultaneously underwent a pancreas and kidney transplant following a randomised procedure tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (by protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached at the goal level from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Gut transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric clinical study with oral program as a primary immunosuppressant after colon transplantations showed an up-to-date survival rate of 75% after 1 year under Tacrolimus and Prednisone, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for the early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) and CMV infections, bone marrow enlargement, additional administration of the interleukin-2-antagonist daclizumab, lower initial doses of Tacrolimus, which lead to tallies between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplant radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound effect of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolised before excretion, whereby the excretion is mainly done by bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf in stable patients treated by Prograf (twice daily) in the ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg) in relation to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the Tacrolimus Talking levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data for the retarded formulation are available.</seg>
<seg id="1499">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="1500">28 confirmed evacuations within the first 24 weeks of the advance group (N = 237) amounted to 32.6% and in the Prograf group (N = 234) 29.3%.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital hemorrhage caused by the deficiency of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adva is used to treat bleedings or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes clotting problems like bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced which enables it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently, so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the drug was investigated to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of adva in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new hemorrhages with "excellent" or "good" was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Lawyers may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mausal or hamster protein or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for the placing on the market for Advate in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels (in% of the norm or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injections every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute depression are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injections repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment process, proper determination of the factor VIII plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis To the long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should depend on the patient's condition, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) versus Factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of Factor VIII-directional IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to Factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In the case of pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositions and anamnestic known inhibitor development, a recombinant Factor VIII product was observed after conversion of (low-tipped) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">In the majority of patients ADRs were inhibitors for Factor VIII (5 patients) who had previously untreated patients who had a higher risk of forming inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare (1 / 10.000), not known (frequency based on available data).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop of the blood coagulation factor VIII-level occurred postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient with continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout time and both the factor VIII levels in the plasma and the Clearance rate showed sufficient levels again on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE on 145 children and adults 2 with acute severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 days of exposure with ADVATE.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 pediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) found a FVIII inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients in a current clinical study 5 of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated patients were inhibitors to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed either a statistically significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti-CHO cell protein, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that referred to an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the incidence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes had been reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 As with other intravenous products ADVATE reports about hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency not known).</seg>
<seg id="1567">The activated Factor VIII works as a coofactor for the activated Factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, based on the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates submission of PSURs every 6 months, the CHMP has decided to apply for further extension procedures in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited officially announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the Company resumes its application for authorisation for the use of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in advexin is an adenovirus that has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot cause infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable cancer cells to re-establish normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the p53 gene that is not present in the human body, usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly and the cancer cells can grow further and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li-Fraumeni-Cancer occurred in the area of undergrowth, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP examined the answers given by the company to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initial documents, the CHMP reports on day 120 a list of questions sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not proved sufficiently that the injection of advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumour brings benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company did not prove sufficiently that advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know the CHMP whether the withdrawal had consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "combo-use" programmes with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "" "" "means that the tablets are put together so that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal hypoallergenic rhinitis (hay fever, an allergy to pollen caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (nasal nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and young people aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice a day a tablet which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucous membrane (clogged nose), are subverted.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effects were the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all hay fever symptoms except constipation of the nose, the patients who took aeronaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in the patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was examined, the patients with Aerinaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who received desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chasing), oral dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, Pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or laucomedin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), urinary retention (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyrosis) or a hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral haemorrhage) or have a risk for a hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the European Commission for the transport of aerinaze across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but can be swallowed whole (i.e. without biting, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aeronaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms decay.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aeronaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks of ending such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergoid, silificiid, cabergolin, ergotamine, Dihydrogotamine or other Dekongestiva (phenylpropanol, phenylephrine, ephedrine, Oxymetazoline, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient and the data is not sufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or strengthening of the headache) must be discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertonia • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, blower obstruction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze should be deprecated at least 48 hours prior to performing dermatological tests as antihistamines can otherwise inhibit or reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">However, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed in the context of clinical trials with andloratadin in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between those treated with or placebo-treated patients regardless of whether or not they were taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded altogether.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aeronaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to frequency in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of Pseudoephedrine, aeronaze should not be applied during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases there may be a dizziness that may result in impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lettuce.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, mental depression, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precorrosive pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, just like atropine-typical symptoms (dry dryness, pupillary rigidity and dilatation, skin erythema, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selector on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study conducted with adults, Dloratadin 5 mg did not affect standard measurement parameters including the amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was found at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestation of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal, allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets, determined by the overall score for the symptoms (except nasal mucosal swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets did not show any significant differences regarding gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of Aerofaze, the body is detectable within 30 minutes of dosing in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow equilibrium of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects were badly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the allotted administration of Pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was to exposure after injection of an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">However, based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, gene otoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with a lost body cannot be identified with any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination did not have greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient called Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg per day and on rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation, a pharmaceutical covigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the alleviation of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you experience or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases when you are using aerinaze: • Blood pressure • heart chasing, heart palpitations • Cardiovascular disorders • nausea and headaches or strengthening existing headache.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you are taking Aeronaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">In case of use in the recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that Aeronaze will lead to light-headedness or decrease the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aero than you should inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aero than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot to take a dose in time, take the dose as soon as possible and use the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market introduction of desloratadin, it was rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chasing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of prominent liver strains has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisat for taking (soluble tablets), 2.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal variations in rhinitis and two studies on patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Effectiveness has been measured by examining the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrant, disability of sleep and capacity in the day) before and after six weeks treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to demonstrate that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to intake and the enamel tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of amerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptoms of symptoms (symptom scores) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urticaria, the decrease of the symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% was compared to 40 and 33% compared to placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, laucomedin, or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted SP Europe a permit for the placing of Aerius in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with or without a meal, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of desoratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the present disease process and can be terminated after the decay of the symptoms and resumed in their reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to the patient during the allergy season.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with the diluoradin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to light-headedness which may result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were tiredness (1,2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 young patients aged 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and in 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, which was administered up to 45 mg desloratadin (nine-times clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selector on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study involving multiple doses that was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Dloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters including the amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis may also be classified as an alternative in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistifying allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the basis of the overall survey of the quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergies.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated for further forms of urticaria as the underlying pathophysiology despite the etiology of different forms is similar and chronic patients can be randomly recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamination is a causative factor in all cases of urticaria, it is expected that in other forms of the urticaria, in other forms of the urticaria, it is expected to improve the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical practice guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and lowering the size and number of quads at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desoratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study, in which the patient demobils were comparable to the general seasonal-allergic rhinitis population, a higher concentration of disloratadine was achieved in 4% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no clues for clinically relevant cumulation after a daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In-vivo desloratadin does not inhibit CYP2D6 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dose of 7,5 mg meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with andloratadin and laucomedin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with respect to the toxicity profile of desloratadin and Loratadin in a comparable degree of exposure to desloratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of the meals, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by infection (see Section 4.4) and that there are no data available to support treatment of an infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis of anamnesis, physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children metabolise metabolise desloratadin between 2 and 11 years and experience greater substance exposure (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which is highly metabolized, is identical to that of children who metabolize normal.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-lactose-absorption or sucase-insufficiency of this medicine should not be taken.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies using Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius than those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents who were given up to 45 mg desloratadin (nine-times clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged 1 to 11 who were eligible for an antihistamine therapy received a daily dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronically idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days in adults, no extension of the Qtc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents found no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">With a single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect psychomotor impairment.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither a reinforcement of the alcohol-induced loss of performance nor an increase in drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown on the basis of the overall survey of the quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergenic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and lowering the size and number of quads at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this fully metabolizing phenotype was similar to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger in black (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which can be metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The loading (AUC) by desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the CMAx was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-value of about 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no clues for clinically relevant drug accumulation after a daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In several one-dose clinical studies, AUC- and CMAx values of deshatadin were comparable to pediatric patients at recommended doses with those of adults who received desoratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. approved the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company withdraws its application for the use of Aflunov for the prevention of aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied in adults and elderly to the protection against flu, which is caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus which might cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to man, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the vaccine is passed, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to form antibodies more quickly in a contact with a flu virus of this tribe.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane envelope of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognises as a body foreign) was purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">This did not extend the scope of the clinical data base to evaluate the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are taking part in a clinical trial and need more information regarding your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you require further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also included in the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients unable to swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution to intake, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed once the doctor has examined which antiviral medicines the patient had previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus being addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg kritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between 4 and 12 years of age and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infection related to AIDS and disease.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies involving 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">In 206 adults who used protease inhibitors were compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml after 48 weeks under Agenerase, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but with the children treated earlier with protease inhibitors, only very few responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the medicine Agenerase reinforced with Ritonavir increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment just as effectively as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV resistant to four other protease inhibitors, there was a stronger decrease in the viral load after four weeks with Ritonavir compared to the patients who continued their previous protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common Agenera side effects (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea, flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may also not be used in patients who take St. John's Wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicinal products, which are also reduced to health detrimental in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take Agenera reduce the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) or immune activation syndromes (symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase were outweighed in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee found that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously had not taken protease inhibitors has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenerase was originally authorised under "exceptional circumstances" since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the placing of caravans in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Normally Agenera capsules are supposed to be given to the pharmacokinetic booster of Amprenavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% less than amprenavir as capsule; therefore, Agenera capsules and solution are not interchangeable for intake on a milligram per milligram base (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenera Capsules is 600 mg amprenavir twice a day, with 100 mg of ritonavir twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the intensifying addition of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of aggrazing (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenera capsules is 20 mg amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction with caution, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be used at the same time with drugs that have a low therapeutic latitude and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with Agenerase, does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenera capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing hepatic function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous use of Agenera and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous dosing of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Normals Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however, the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored at Opiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity due to the high level of propylene glycol content of the Agenera solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be reduced to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, the incidence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases associated with the treatment of medications that are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug addictive factors, such as a lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, leading to severe clinical condition or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is accepted (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol intake, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecarse were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase may not simultaneously be given with drugs that have a low therapeutic latitude and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are primarily metabolised via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction of the AUC from amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the lower plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse reactions to the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amprenavirus and, if possible, check the viral load and reduce the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary if nelfinavir is given together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508%, by contrast, increased by 30% for CMAX when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir Capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amprenavir twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily were used to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this treatment regiatas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) was given.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma that were achieved in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, but a close monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with didano in combination with didanosine, but it is recommended that Didano's anesthesia is at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended since the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised as Delaviruses could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly substitutive plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When used together, caution is advised; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out, as precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirus is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Rifabutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thus an increase in the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">When it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin along with Agenera, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg. of fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazol once daily led to an increase in the CMAx of ketoconazol in plasma 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the 2.69time compared to the value observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once daily with no simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 may, if used together with Agenera, may lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs when used in combination with Agenera.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on data from other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as Agenera, as it may lead to resorption dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as enzyme reducers (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as amnidipine, diltiazem, felodipine, Isradenpine, Nicardipin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nicholecpin and verapamil can be increased 10 by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous use with Agenerase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with PDE5 inhibitors related side effects including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days per person, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of Agenera with Ritonavir is not recommended with these glucocorticoids, unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, which strongly depend on CYP3A4, are expected to increase the plasma levels at the same time as Agenera.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including rhubdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations up to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended, since the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporine, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased while the addition of amprenavir can be increased (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be used in conjunction with oral mdazolam (see Section 4.3), while using parenteral midazolam while at the same time using parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseininhibitors point to a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam around the 3 to 4-Fache.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored at Opiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to adjust the amprenavirus dosage if Amprenavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulas along with Agenerase is recommended for increased control of INR (international normative ratio) because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended while using Agenera (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may be used only after careful weighing of possible use for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amprenavir-related substances have been detected in the milk of lactose-related rats, but it is not known whether amprenavir leaves people in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was given by the implantation in the uterus until the end of the lactation period amprenavir, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during breast-feeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of the offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was examined in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the treatment of Agenera were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely led to the treatment breakage.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are associated with taking Agenera or other medicines used at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the adverse events listed below stem from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006) in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of Agenera twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed at more than 1% of patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and facial fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroviral not pretreated individuals who had been treated with amprenavir in combination with Lamivudine or Zidovudine for a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (Stiernack) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 there were 7 cases (3%) in 245 NRTIs compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients with Indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderately distinct, erythematous or makulopapules, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment having to be canceled with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteoarthritis cases were reported in patients with generally known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients receiving 600 mg of Agenera twice a day with low dose kritonavir (degree 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) to those who were observed under sole Agenerase treatment, were very common in patients who received Agenera along with low-dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient must observe signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gag- and gag-pol- polyproteinprecursors with the consequence of an formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibit concentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range from 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non pretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as in other Ritonavir treatment regimens with proteaseininhibitors - the mutations described rarely were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral not previously untreated patients who received 700mg Fosamprenavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to 48, with 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, M46I / L, I47V, G48V, I62V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg kritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients with protease inhibitors were treated with virological failure over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on genotypic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / S, I84V and L90M in conjunction with increased phenotypic resistance to fosamprenavir with Ritonavir as well as a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutations may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with genotypic data for estimating the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with proteasvase-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs (division points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic samples with reduced sensitivity to amprenavir creates a certain cross resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral not pre-treated patients in which a fosamprenavirus halted (one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir (one out of 25 isolates), Darunavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three out of 24 isolates) and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other proteasvase-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early termination of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits that may adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, with PI pre-treated adults after virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and Nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-one (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) after 16 weeks, with a non-leaching threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbleached Agenera is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years, of which 152 was treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenera's solution for inhaling and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosed ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs agreed together with Agenera.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "" "" "19 Based on this data, the benefit of" "" "" "" "unbleached" "" "" "" "Agenera should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre-treated children." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral dosing, the mean duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir amounts approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">By contrast, 508% is increased by 30% for CMAX when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was given twice daily with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimal concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous food intake influences the rate and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir that represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component during dosing intervals fluctuates depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady state over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines which induce or inhibit CYP3A4 and represent a substrate of CYP3A4 must be given caution when given at the same time with Agenerase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenera capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is less bioavailable from the solution than from the capsules; therefore, Agenera solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on one milligram base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the effect of renal dysfunction is likely to be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment regimens lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained twice daily on healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous administration of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amprenavir on mice and rats, in male animals enigne hepatocellular adenomas in dosifications containing the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.2-times (rat) of human exposure after twice daily administration of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the genesis of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">The present exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies and therapeutical application, showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo and in-vitro gene-oxidation tests, the bacterial reverse mutation testing (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberrations were included in human peripheral lymphocytes, amprenavir was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical practice by measuring AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase activity.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now, no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the administration of Agenera nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated aged 4 days showed high mortality both in the control and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposition which was significantly lower (rabbits) or significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to therapeutic doses, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes have been observed, indicating a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the intensifying addition of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of aggrazing (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenera capsules is 20 mg amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous application should be administered cautiously in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Normals Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Agenerase should be stopped at the age of 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and with drug addictive factors, such as a lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction of the AUC from amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508%, by contrast, increased by 30% for CMAX when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir Capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma that were achieved in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, but a close monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended since the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2074">When used together, caution is advised; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out, as precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirus is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">When it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin along with Agenera, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as amnidipine, diltiazem, felodipine, Isradipine, Nicardipin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nicholecpin and verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days per person, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">Simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulas along with Agenerase is recommended for increased control of INR (international normative ratio) because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of ortho-novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg of ethinylestradiol plus 1.0 mg of norethindrons) led to a decrease of the AUC and Cmin from amprenavir by 22% or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This drug may be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of possible use for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was given by the implantation in the uterus until the end of the lactation period amprenavir, showed a diminished increase in body weight during breast-feeding.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The harmlessness of Agenerase was examined in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of overdose, the patient must observe signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% inhibit concentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0,012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">On the other hand, Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other proteasvase-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on this data, the benefit of "unbleached" Agenera should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre-treated children.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component during dosing intervals fluctuates depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady state over the area of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss..</seg>

<seg id="2097">Agenera's solution to intake is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1-infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="2098">The benefit of using ritonavir "bleached" Agenera solution for intake was neither occupied with PI pre-treated patients nor with PI pre-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="2099">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% less than amprenavir as capsule; therefore, Agenera capsules and solution are not interchangeable for intake on a milligram per milligram base (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2100">Patients should, as soon as they are able to swallow the capsules, stop taking the solution to intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2101">The recommended dose for Agenera solution is 17 mg (1.1 ml) amprenavir / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2800 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2102">In addition, since no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of Agenera solution for intake and low dose kritonavir, this combination in these patient groups is avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although a dose adjustment for amprenavir is not considered necessary, an application of Agenerase is contraindicated in patients with kidney failure (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high propyl-glycolic acid, Agenera is contraindicated in pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2105">Simultaneous dosing can lead to a competitive inhibiting of the metabolism of these medicines and may cause serious and / or life-threatening side effects such as cardiac arrhythmias (z).</seg>
<seg id="2106">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="2107">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with Agenerase, does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="2108">For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Normals Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Agenerase should be stopped permanently if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="2202">Iriquimod was not studied for the treatment of actinic keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lib.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Very limited data on the application of imiquimodine for the treatment of actinic keratoses in anatomical locations outside the face and scalp are available.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratosis on the forearms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually take in the course of therapy in intensity or go back after setting the therapy with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If local skin reactions cause major discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 lesions had a lower total recovery rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to immunostimulatory properties, Imiquimod cream should be applied with care in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, binding or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although no quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) have been achieved either after a one-off or after several times topical application, no recommendation can be given for application during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of Imiquimod-cream related side effects in studies with three-week treatment were local reactions on the site of the treatment of the cowards (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most frequently reported and probably or possibly associated with the application of the Imiquimod-cream in the related side effects include discomfort on the application location with an incidence of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The side effects reported by 185 with Imiquimod-creme treated in a placebo-controlled phase III clinical study were shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common adverse event, probably or possibly associated with the application of the Imiquimodine crème, was a reaction to the application location (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod) in these studies.</seg>
<seg id="2215">The adverse events reported in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with Imiquimod-Cream were listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimod-cream we frequently encountered local skin reactions including Erythem (61%), erosion (30%), exchoriation / abscaling (23%) and edema (14%) (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these studies, with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod-cream, severe erythema (31%), severe erosion (13%), and severe shortening and evaporation (19%) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the application of imiquimodine for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment center or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadverbial oral intake of 200 mg iodquimod, which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headaches, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The most clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, was in hypotony which normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic study, increasing systemic concentrations of the alpha interferon and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies it was possible to demonstrate that efficacy is significantly superior to a complete healing of the cowards during Imiquimodine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of patients who had been treated with Imiquimod, the cowards completely healed; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients who received placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing was achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with Imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod in five-malting use per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The tumors were histologically confirmed primary superficialant basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period of time, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, not hypertrophic lesions within a related 25 cm2 treatment area on the uneasy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The two-year data from two combined observational studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing following one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications external stimuli, actinic keratosis and super cell carcinoma generally do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Creme is examined in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or up).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Minimal systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed in three times weekly application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml during application in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated obvious half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-value after subcutaneous use in a previous study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod after topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or ultra-fictional basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in rat doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg resulted in significantly lowered body weight and increased lacing weight; a study conducted for the dermal application for four months resulted in no similar effects on the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice following maler administration three days a week did not induce tumours in the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not discouraged, a risk to humans is considered very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumours appeared in the group of mice treated with the agent-free cream, earlier and in larger number than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It can harm other people even though these have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the listed side effects have severely compromised you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="2244">If left untreated, it can lead to distortions, especially in the face - so early detection and - treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic keratoses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to much of the solar radiation during their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be applied in case of flat actinic keratosis in the face and scalp in patients with a healthy immune system, where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most appropriate treatment for you.</seg>

<seg id="2254">If you have intercourse while infection with genital warts in the genital area, the treatment with Aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not before) is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have used other medicines or have recently used it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Do not breastfeed your baby during treatment with Aldara Cream, as it is not known whether Imiquimodine migrates into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different for basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to clean, dry skin with the tilt warts and gently rub the cream on the skin until the cream is fully absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with cowards below the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area below (see section 2) What do you need to consider before using Aldara cream? ").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>

<seg id="2265">A lower number of blood cells can make you more prone to infection; it can cause you to develop a blue spot faster or it can cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will affect you significantly or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you applied to Aldara Cream (8% of the patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Most of these are lighter skin reactions that will sound once again within 2 weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally, some patients may notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, scarring, skin irritation, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally some patients suffer from changes in the application location (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, swollen eyes), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, congestion, swelling of the eyelids, sore throat, diarrhea, actinic keratosis, redness, facial swelling, ulcers, body aches, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Alsatiazyme is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms which are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, complicating movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Administering aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalizing devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, the safety of the drug was examined, however, its efficacy was measured (by examining its effect regarding reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme reduced GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion place.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years of age are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measure of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will check every year all new information that may be known, and if necessary update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The producer of Alsatiazyme will observe patients who receive aldurazyme in response to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the distribution of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Alsatiazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with aldurazyme should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any adverse event occurring during infusion or until the end of the fusion-day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of aldurazyms should only occur in a suitable clinical environment in which recovery facilities are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 trial, it is expected that virtually all patients form IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reactions have to be treated with caution when using aldurazyms (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Due to the theoretically increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment, there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Pre-treat 60 minutes before onset of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or anti-pyretic) in order to minimize the potential incidence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the event of a slight or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the event of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion has to be stopped until symptoms have been reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or procain, because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular intakes of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies do not omit direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data in newborns exposed to breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Alsatiazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly reported as infusion-related responses, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase 3 study and their prolongation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older for a duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table following the following frequency: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-conditional participation in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing difficulty and face edema (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted Drug Repercussions associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe form and duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients received a seroconversion within 3 months after the onset of the treatment, with a more severe form of follow-up in patients under the age of 5 (on average after 26 days of 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or until early retirement from the study) no antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) Assay, among them 3 patients who had never had a seroconic version.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in urine, while in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in urine had to be detected.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 trial and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic larvae activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the treatment of enzymes is in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the cycle and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients had the median phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Alsatiazyme every week for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with aldurazyme showed improvement in lung function and ability to be treated in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Alsatiazyme / Alsatiazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Alsatiazyme group, as indicated in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the total lung volumes increased proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatomizer before treatment 22 (85%) until the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant drop in the GAG mirror was found in the urine (µg / mg of Kreatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">With regard to the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined endpoint, clinically significant changes were taken across across five efficacy variables (expected percentage normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute walk test, motion area of shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow-up).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- Mirror in Harn in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were found after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe current form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe form of delay only limited or even no progress in cognitive development had to be detected.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various aldurazyms dosage schemes were carried out on the GAG mirror in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute gait test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">Dosing regimens with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in a one-off application, toxicity in repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another medicine against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (cancer treatments) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole treatment in patients who have not previously been treated in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy regimens.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, the patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the application of cisplatin, an "antiemetic" (medicine for vomiting) and liquids (in order to prevent a fluid deficiency) should be given.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be delayed, removed or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetrexed thus slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Converting Pemetrexed into its active form is easier for cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleural amesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in 1 725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and cisplatin outlived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in the exclusive administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7,9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which the cancer did not attack the squamous cells during the administration of Alimta demonstrated longer survival compared to the comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for the placing of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.2ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a 25 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dosing is removed from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml further (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with Lo- Kal advanced or metastatic non-single-celled bronchial cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered as an intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetrexed- Infusion on the first day of each 21-day treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell carcinoma after prior chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as an intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions the day before and on the day of the pemetrexed gift and on the day after the treatment a corticosteroid will be given.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) a week before the first pemetrexed dose and after each third operation cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive pemetrexed, a complete blood count should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and platelet teeth.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanin-Transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment course, a dose-examination must take place taking into account the Nadirs of the blood image or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the preceding treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), the treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient has the value prior to treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if in patients after 2 dose dukes a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so- on the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies did not indicate that in patients aged 65 or above, there is an increased risk of side effects compared to patients aged 65 and older.</seg>
<seg id="2386">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustment was necessary for patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 45 ml / min, which would go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5-fold the upper Bilirubin limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; 0-fold the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically investigated in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone marcosuppression and Pemetrexed may not be administered to patients before their absolute number of neutrophils again has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the absolute neutrality of neutrophils, thrombocyte numbers and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in previous courses of treatment (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 haematological and non-haematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia was treated when a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed need to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophy- lactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous ingesting nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with Pemetrexed therapy must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-time for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients with these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, a drainage of the effusion before the pemetrexed treatment should be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported occasionally in clinical trials involving pemetrexed when this drug was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated lifes (excluding yellow fever, this inoculation is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is possible by pemetrexed, men should be advised before the course of treatment to obtain advice on the sperm count.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, like ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid can result in reduced pemetrexed separation with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is recommended if high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be applied in high doses in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses should be avoided for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is present regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, simultaneous use with Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetreboxed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the illness and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Norised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with antimetabolites severe birth defects are expected for an application in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be used during pregnancy, except if it is essential and after careful consideration of the benefit for the mother and the risk of the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is possible by pemetrexed, men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to seek advice on the sperm configuration.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetrexed is excessive in breast milk and unwanted effects in breastfed infants can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomized cisplatin and pemetrexed and 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antineoplastic antifolate which exercises its effect by interrupting important folate-dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that pemetrexed works as antifolate with several points of attack by blocking the thyme dylate synthase (DHFR) and glycinamidribonucleotide for- myltransferase (GARFT), which are nucleotide-dependent key enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomised, simple-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin at chemonaiven patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically important advantage of an overall median 2.8-month prolonged survival compared to those patients treated with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Patients who take alli and do not receive weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot metabolise some fats in the food, resulting in a quarter of the fats taken with the food undigested the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared to placebo in 391 obese patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who received 460 mg total weight after one year had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 showed no weight loss for patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily spots on after, flatus (winds) with stucco, stool, oily / oily chair, outlet oily secretions (fazes), flatulence (winds) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It may not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in graft patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also not be used in patients suffering from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract) or cholestase (liver disease), and in pregnant women and nursing mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Limited for the placing of orders for orlistat GSK throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypocaloric, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli should not be used by children and young people under 18, because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is resorbed only minimally, no adaptation of the dosage is necessary for elderly people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin • Treatment of chronic malabsorption (see Section 4.6) • Prevent time (see Section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic must be adapted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these drugs has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional precautionary measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a reduction of the Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When applying Warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the quick values (international normal ratio, INR) could be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat for up to 4 full years, concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take supplements of multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the addition of a one-time dose of Amiodarone, a small number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time have observed a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are linked to the pharmacological effect of the drug as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials involving orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000), not known (frequency based on available data).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of known adverse events determined after the market launch of orlistat is unknown, as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and obese subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdose, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies in humans and animals, it is possible to proceed from a rapid recovery of possible systemic effects caused by the properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect sets in the lumens of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active serine remnants of the gastric and pankreatic lipasa.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have shown that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, inhibit absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, taken three times daily in combination with hypocaloric, fat-reduced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to baseline value (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as follows: a change in the body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and the proportion of those who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average total cholesterol in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2,4% (baseline 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was with orlistat 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3,30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value of 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (baseline 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg of orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could be detected only sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactonearring) and M3 (M1 after fission of the N-Formyl leucine group), were identified in a study with obese patients presenting approximately 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, gene otoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are associated with the effects of the capsules and are caused by the fact that more fat is excreted from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects generally occur within the first weeks of the treatment, since at this time you might not have consistently reduced the amount of fat in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules, you can learn to minimize diet-related side effects: • Start a few days or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat-reduced diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases. • Distribute your recommended amount of fat evenly to daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take each meal, not to take it in the form of a fat-rich main dish or a substantial dessert, as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction.</seg>

<seg id="2596">A permanent weight loss, for example by improving nutrition and more exercise, can prevent serious diseases and has a beneficial effect on your health.</seg>
<seg id="2597">Choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients, and gradually learn to eat healthily.</seg>
<seg id="2598">Energy is also measured in kilojoules, which you can also find as indication of food packaging. • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume each day.</seg>
<seg id="2599">Note the tables below in this section. • The recommended intake of fat in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal.</seg>
<seg id="2600">The amount of calories that is appropriate for you can be found below, which indicates the number of calories that are appropriate for you. • Due to the mode of operation of the capsule, compliance with recommended fat intake is essential.</seg>
<seg id="2601">If you take the same amount of fat as before, this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat.</seg>
<seg id="2602">By maintaining the recommended fat intake, you can maximize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the likelihood of diet-related side effects. • You should try to gradually lose weight.</seg>
<seg id="2603">34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight approximately 0.5 kg per week without developing frustrations and disappointments.</seg>
<seg id="2604">The more active you are, the higher your recommended calorie intake. • "Low physical activity" means that you burn up stairs, work in the garden or perform other physical activities. • "Middle physical activity" means that you exercise 150 kcal per day, i.e. through 3 km walk, 30 to 45 minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2605">• For permanent weight loss, it is necessary to set realistic calories and fat targets and respect them. • It is a nutritional diary with information on calorie and fat content of your meals. • Try to move more before you start taking alli.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin) as well as in chemotherapy, which are moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antiemetic agent).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended since there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy, strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 from 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 out of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 from 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a permit for the placing of Aloxi in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy because of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy because of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of alopxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy may be amplified by adding a corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">As Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnestial obstipation or signs of subacute ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable with simultaneous administration of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT interval is extended or which tend to undergo such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi is not intended to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron unhampered the activity of the five chemotherapeutics examined against tumors (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous Palonosetron dose and a Steady-State- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">A pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population showed that CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (amiodarone, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, haloperidol, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant effect on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women, unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common side effects of a dose of 250 micrograms were reported (a total of 633 patients) who were at least related to Aloxi, headache (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration of administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-effects-relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, but due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not effective in case of an alopxir overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients receiving a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 100 mg dolasetron (half-life period of 7.3 hours) were given intravenously at day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, 667 patients receiving a strong emetogenic chemotherapy containing ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron, which were given intravenously at day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Following clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarisation and prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of i.v. Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Following an intravenous application, an initial decrease of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average terminally half-value of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to the intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) mean increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that the overall position measured at once daily intravenous injection of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to that measured after a one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after the one-time dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, are involved in the enzymes of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms per kilogram [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as immutable active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">The total body size was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min after a single intravenous bolus injection in healthy eyes.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver dysfunction, terminal exclusion is increased and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron is increased, but this does not justify a reduction of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were only observed after exposures, which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies, indications have shown that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose equivalent to about 30fold of the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high doses and since Aloxi is determined by humans for one-off use, the relevance of these results is considered to be low for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) approved a negative report recommending the failure to approve the use of the drugs intended for the treatment of hepatitis C with Alphe6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU (also called "referenced medical drug").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheleon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease called by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue damages damage, furthermore, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood are abnormal.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) has been injected into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The Alpheleon producer showed data demonstrating the comparison of Alpheleon with Roferon-A (active substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, effectiveness, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheleon was compared to the efficacy of the reference medicine to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were expressed in the absence of sufficient data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alpheand Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with alpheleon, the disease was again flamed for more patients than with the referral drug; furthermore, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug establishes an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected infirmations (crack or cutting wounds), abrasions and seedged wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been detectable or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because of this kind of infection may not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years the surface area to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced), thereby inhibiting the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was sublimated at the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were examined in skin wounds, approximately 90% of patients in both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infection caused or presumably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect associated with altargo (which was observed between 1 and 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo in short-term treatment outweigh the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Ltd., a permit for placing altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy may be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation by using the reapamulin ointment the treatment should be aborted, the ointment carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Reapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of retinosinulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered, if after a 2 to 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical pharmaceuticals is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on skimped skin or infected superficial wounds (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the same oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment on skimped skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustments are not considered necessary when topical reapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate with regard to a statement on the effects on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">During pregnancy Retapamulin ointment should only be used when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinamulin is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / ended, the benefit of breastfeeding should be weighed down for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied altargo, the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the date of administration that concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the Peptidyltransferase center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Through binding to this binding site, polyleuromutiline inhibits peptide transfer, block partial P-binding interactions, and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should, due to the local prevalence of resistance the application of retinamulin at least appear questionable in some forms of infection, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences in in-vitro activity of retinamulin were found opposite S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% reapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and weakened skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% retreat twice a day for 5 days to topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, single plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 with the adult patients each before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake of people after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 of skimped skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP escapement.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism in vitro oxidative metabolism in human liver microwaves was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were signs of changes in liver and thyroid disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro-examination for gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphooma test respectively in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rat microkernel test for in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, thus achieving up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application to 200 cm2 of skinned skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats, oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (in accordance with the ≥ 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above), development stoicity (decreased body weight of the fetus and delayed ossification) and maternal toxicity were determined.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged one to 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization, and it is ensured that the vaccination plan existing from two doses can be completed.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresh dose is desired for hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (body's natural defences), as it can defend against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and generates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix also contains the same components as the approved vaccine of Twinrix adults since 1996 and the approved vaccine of Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because ambirix and Twinrix adult contain identical ingredients, some of the data supporting the application of Twinrix adult were also used as evidence of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional 208 children study, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led between 98% and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations of hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protecting atmosphere at a six-month gap between the injections was similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, matureness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, any of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission informed the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, p.a. a permit for placing ambient atmosphere in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for primordial immunization with Ambirix consists of two doses of vaccines, the first dose at the date of the election and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresh rate is desired for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody-based anti-hepatitis B (anti-HAV) antibodies have the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent individuals who have responded to hepatitis A vaccination will need a refresher as protection, since they may be protected by immunological memory even in non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection-vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA-units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemodialysis patients and people with dysfunctions of the immune system, under certain circumstances, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody is reached, so that in these cases the administration of further vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intramuscular injection or intramuscular administration in the buttocks could lead to a suboptimal outcome, these injection methods should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, with thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, however, ambiquitos can be injected subcutaneously as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was adequate to all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it is necessary to assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matchiness, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomersal and preservative formative formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 immaculate doses of Ambirix were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, Ambirix's compatibility with the 3-dose combination vaccine was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturities on a calculation basis per vaccination dose of Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix in 50,7% of the subjects compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66,4% of the subjects receiving the ambix reported pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matterity was comparable to each proband (i.e., across the entire vaccine cycle at 39.6% of the subjects receiving the ambix compared to 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and weariness was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccination, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambientxgroup was similar to that observed when administered with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA-units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the 6- to 11- year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">Statistically, the percentage of vaccine that reported serious side effects during the 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted in vaccine trials at the age of 1 to including 15 years, serum conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">Serum conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted between 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was worthless, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3-dose-vaccine significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA-units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were at the time of primacy between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction observed in this study against both antigens was comparable to that found after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study from 12- to including 15-year-olds, it was shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme to that of the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year at the same time coincided with the refresher creation of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates for the current formulation as for earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the resusension on possible foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You may feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix may not fully protect from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus prior to serving both doses of vaccine (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you have an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic), an allergic reaction to your child.</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction may be caused by itching skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B, if you / your child has a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you quickly want to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled administration of the second vaccination card).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from an inoculation with ambix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection prior to the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes ambix is sprayed in people suffering from severe coagulation disorders, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defences, or if you / your child is undergoing a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to the vaccine may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the response to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Say to your doctor if you / your child will take / take other medicines (including those you can get without prescription) or if you / your child have recently been vaccinated / has received / or is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambix, it should be vaccinated at separate places and as different limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If ambix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, ambix pregnant or breastfeeding women are not administered unless it is urgently necessary to be vaccinated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Please let your doctor know if you have an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ very frequently (more than 1 case per 10 tapped cans): • pain or discomfort on the spot or redness • matchiness • irritability • headache • lack of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">Smoking frequently (up to 1 case per 10 demented cans): • swelling at the injection site • fever (over 38 ° C) • lightheaded • gastrointestinal complaints</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects that have been reported days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B are very rare (less than 1 case per 10,000 leaked doses) are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include locally restricted or extended rashes that may be itching or bulbous, swelling of the eye area and face, difficult breathing or swallowing, sudden drop of blood pressure and unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="2801">Flu-like complaints, including chills, muscle and joint pain, seizures, dizziness, abnormalities such as tingling and "ant running," multiple sclerosis, diseases of the optic nerve, loss of sensation or tenacity of some body parts, strong headaches and stiffness of the neck, interruption of normal brain functions</seg>
<seg id="2802">Fainting inflammation of some blood vessels is malaise or feeling of illness, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain, liver function tests, increased tendency to bleedings or bruising (bruises) caused by rubbish of the blood platelet.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which has become known since the issuance of the first authorization for the placing of the market, the CHMP has agreed that the benefits-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was put into circulation only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonade can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defects or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage as a result of high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps - split by several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall in the stomach of leading hose) or a nasal tube (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, as Ammonaps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a pseudo-drug, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonade can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal levels of acid in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste saversion, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Ammontaps in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonade was approved under "exceptional circumstances" because of the disease's rarity at the time of approval, only limited information was available for this drug.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme shortage has already been manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a delayed-retardant form (incomplete enzyme defect that manifests itself after the first month of life) there is then an indication for the use, if there is hyperammonia encephalopathy in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing AMMONAPS is also available in granulate form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient's growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early lack of carbamphosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatynthetase deficiency have to receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swallowing, as there is a risk of the formation of oesophagus ulcera, if the tablets do not reach the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore AMMONAPS should only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and edema associated clinical states.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since the metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyate takes place over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is unknown; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous injection of phenylacetate to young rats at high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), neural reproduction and increased neuronal loss were slowed down.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve lesions in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It is not possible to determine if phenylacetate is excreted by humans into breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least one undesired event (AE) occurred in 56% of patients and 78% of those adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectal woman who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in connection with lactate dosis, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg per day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound, which is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Puschiometrically seen phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed to produce sodium phenylbutyrate recorded for each gram of 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prediction of the early manifestation of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infused, and the disease itself led to death in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the exploitation of alternative routes of nitrogenous excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diets and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns at postpartal (but within the first life month) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and who were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a delayed manifest form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygous shape of the Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even during treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">Phenylacetate is known to be oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzymatic with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were measured after administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobine metabolism and liver cirrhosis after individual release as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected 15 minutes after taking.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with leakage-cycle disorders or haemoglobinopathies, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable in the plasma next morning after overnight fast.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis treated repeatedly with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the average phenylacetate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion This medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine above the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">After the Micronucleus test results, sodium phenylbutyrate with toxic and non-toxic doses had no apparent effects (investigation 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granules are either taken orally (babies and children not yet able to swallow tablets, or patients with difficulty swallowing) or via a gastrostomieschlauch or a nasal tube.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg per day for newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammoniac, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early lack of carbamphosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat turtles were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrate), lesions in the pyramids of the brain cortex occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectal woman who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in connection with lactate dosis, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Puschiometrically seen phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess.</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate of 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylacetylacetylacetylate can be produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granulate form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected within 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the durability, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0,95 g, the mean measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring scoop 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate after eating proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS as sodium phenylbutyrate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding you should not take AMMONAPS as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headaches, taste disturbances, diminution of hearing, disorientation, memory disorders and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or in the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initiating an appropriate treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you miss the dose of AMMONAPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Changes in the blood pattern (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets), decreased appetite, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention (swelling), taste disturbances, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, unpleasant odor, weight gain and abnormal lab results.</seg>
<seg id="2872">Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will affect you significantly or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2873">You can no longer use AMMONAPS after the expiry date specified on the box and the container case.</seg>
<seg id="2874">How AMMONAPS looks and contents of the package AMMONAPS tablets are of whitish color and oval shape, and they are provided with the embossing "UCY 500."</seg>
<seg id="2875">30 If laboratory tests are carried out, tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyrate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2876">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS to the same single doses or via a gastric fistle (hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach) or a nose probe (hose, which is led through the nose to the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take a heaped spoonful of granulate from the container. • Enter a straight edge, e.g. a knife edge over the edge of the knife to remove excess granulate. • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon. • Remove the recommended number of measuring spoons granulate from the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, decreased blood flow to heart), for instance in unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (an anomalous value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients receiving a PCI, a higher dose is administered and infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on ACS treatment, in which the effect of angiox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) with the conventional combination of heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During PCI, patients often received a stent (a short tube left in the artery to prevent the closure) and they received additional medicines to prevent blood clots, such as cantiximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without administration of GPI - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients receiving a PCI, angiox was as effective as heparin regarding all indicators except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivaliddin, other hirudine, or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the placing of angiox in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-heart attack infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of an emergency intervention, or if early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous feed of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If an additional PCI is performed in the patient, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">A bolt-release of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered immediately before the procedure, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous clamping of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an allotted Bolus administration of angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is reduced to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt transfer of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before use and the bolus dose can be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, further surveillance is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">A lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI function (whether treated with Bivaliddin against ACS or not).</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value lies below 225 seconds, a second one-stroke dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolus dose should be examined again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with severe kidney damage, which were included in the Phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which were used for approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the Bivalientine-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also for dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the end of the intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin, or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against Hirudine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a disturbance of hemostasis and / or irreversible clotting disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for patients with dialysis</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivaliddin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if in PCI-patients with bivaliddin most hemorrhages on arterial point-points occur, in patients who undergo a percutaneous coronal intervention (PCI), bleeding can in principle occur everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are treated warfarin and treated with bivaliddin, a monitoring of the INR value (international standard of normative ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bivalidin is again reached prior to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombocyte aggregated inhibitors) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivaliddin with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters can be controlled regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experiments are insufficient with regard to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, binding or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalidin alone, 4604 were randomized to bivaliddin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalidin group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, women and patients more than 65 years of age were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to the ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleedings as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently among bivaliddin than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivaliogradin plus GPIIb / IIIa- inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">ACUITY serious hemorrhage was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraocular hematoma with radiological or surgical intervention, hematoma with ≥ 3 g / dl of well known hemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemoglobin levels, reoperation due to haemorrhage, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other less frequently observed bleeding localizations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" points of point, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following data on adverse events are based on data from a clinical trial with a bivalidin in 6,000 patients who have undergone a PCI study.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the bivaliant group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, women and patients more than 65 years of age were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently among bivaliddin than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported in practice after comprehensive use and are grouped according to system categories in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose, the treatment with bivalidin is to be stopped immediately and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivaliddin, a direct and specific thrombininhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and on the anion coring region of Thrombin irrespective of whether thromboin is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivaliddin to Thrombin, and hence its effect, is reversible, because in its part, thrombosis splits the binding of Bivaliddin-ARG3-Pro4 slowly, thereby regenerating the function of the active center of thromboin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivaliddin assisted the serum of patients with a Thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, bivaliddin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect that is supported by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the patients below, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of bivaliddin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the procedure is increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, fractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST-lever infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in Arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the onset of angiography (at the time of randomisation) or in the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high risk patients who required angiography within 72 hours were spread evenly across the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had a recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG changes or elevated cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent within 72 hours of angiography.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and the 1-year endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and clopidogrel according to protocol (before angiography or before PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with over 6,000 patients who underwent a PCI (REPLACE-2) study, are presented in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalidin were evaluated in patients who underwent a percutaneous coronal intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivaliddin as peptide conducts a catabolism in its amino acid components with subsequent reuse of amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite resulting from the splitting of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through thrombin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic centre of thrombin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require insulin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, upper thigh or upper arm or administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or cannot effectively process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin is very slightly different from the insulin analog, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in human body insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the ingredients, or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH approval for the placing of Apidra in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall, thigh or deltoid or subcutaneous through continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose absorption capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with reduced liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active force, the brand (manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change during the change of the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Among the substances that increase the blood sugar lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycaemia are oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Disopyramid, Fibrate, Fluoxetine, Pentoxifylline (MAO) inhibitors, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of adrenergic counterstimulation can be weakened or missing under the effect of sympathic agents such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidine and reserpine.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and humanoids regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin occurs in human breast milk, but insulin is generally not absorbed into breast milk, nor is it resorbed to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">In the following, the adverse drug reactions reported from clinical studies are grouped according to system categories and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very often: ≥ 1 / 10; often: ≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; not known (frequency based on available data).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, drowsiness, excessive dog, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is missed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area, can occur in the sequence a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemia with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glucoagulation, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the causes of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in case of a subcutaneous GA- be of isisisine the effect occurs faster and the duration of active insulin is shorter than with hu- and normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin sensitivity in the therapeutically relevant dosing range of 0,075 to 0,15 E / kg showed a proportional uptake effect, and at 0.3 e / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosesenic effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucoseship effect approximately 2 hours earlier than the human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a similar postprandial glycaemic control is achieved, as with human body insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisin was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-densial control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulis is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a similar glycaemic control is achieved, as in the normal insulin regulator, which is given 2 rents before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal in comparison to normal insulin regulator, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and in comparison to normal insulin regulator, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin was administered 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to normal insulin regulator, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
