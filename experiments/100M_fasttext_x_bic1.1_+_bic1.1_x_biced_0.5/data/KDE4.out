the module website can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras website . select the source and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list .
if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into the whole &amp; URL .
machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . Bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , translations do not make any important decisions , without checking the translation before .
only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated by yourself on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can insert transl@@ ating texts directly .
package &amp; package ; contains several modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some extra features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings enh@@ ancements .... Open the box card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard installation modules from the k@@ de package ; add@@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click Extras crashes . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if present .
the Calcul@@ ator module ( also called folder filters ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select DO@@ M tree Extras ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportion@@ ately to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View , the size reflects the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . in this way , large files can be easily recognized even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy . consequently , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap account a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over View Colour Mode , can either be depth for the easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , or whether the area is to be used by subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles ( which is , therefore , display errors caused by constraints on the mark of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . moreover , you can set the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle .
for Tre@@ em@@ ap in Tre@@ em@@ ap , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always adher@@ ed to . frames are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
how spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this context , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and for the avoid@@ ance of space losses due to frame always advantageous the areas to arise that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View An@@ ders on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
the Photo Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Photo Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the module image gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can set the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the image gallery page in a text box .
the Picture per line option has a slider and a knob to adjust the number of mini@@ atures of each line in the gallery .
display the fil@@ en@@ ame of the image to see if the file names under the thumb@@ nails are displayed in the gallery .
with the check box file size of the image , you specify whether the file size is shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
show whether the size of the images is displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialog box , specify where the gallery will be saved and which sub @-@ folders are to be included .
in the Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be saved .
with the sub@@ folder check box , you can set the sub @-@ folder with a slider or a swi@@ vel panel , until which level the sub @-@ folders are included .
to copy the original images to the gallery , please specify whether the original images will be copied to the gallery .
with the comment file check box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box sel@@ ve color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation area can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under the window navigation pane or with the F@@ 9 key short@@ cut .
to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback .
change browser identi@@ fier adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in addition to which you can change browser and operating system identi@@ fiers for individual domains . this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser identi@@ fier of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Moz@@ illa / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser , change the browser identi@@ fier into one of the following options .
changes the code in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject access with browsers on the base of Moz@@ illa . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser identi@@ fier to call up with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this out@@ dated browser .
with this option , the default browser identi@@ fier is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing .
with the menu entry ... you can set the scope of information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ rs ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; includes quick image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , review and correct them . editing capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ came ; easy to use , dozens of professional capabilities are available . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG @-@ export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens to search for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvements .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; try to report problems or suggestions as easily as possible . wherever you are in the program , the Help Menu includes one entry troubles or wishes ... This will open a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you use this link , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; edited ; is a project supported by a community . that means that the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , we would like to encourage you to ask the user mailing list of &amp; digi@@ rs . however , you may have questions here to other users of &amp; edited . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; visit homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; edited ;
the best start to get involved is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing up in the developer mailing list of &amp; edited ; .
when you &amp; digi@@ came ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your machine . here , the data file is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ rs ; will additionally use as an old library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images , as base folders . &amp; edited ; viewing each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during browsing the folder you get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; edited ; searches recur@@ sively the library path in its entire depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless it is in hidden folders . this can be done by ex@@ tr@@ bs &amp; digi@@ rs ; you can do this by inser@@ ting a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ Charts have no photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can start &amp; digi@@ plug ; set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword to manage your photos in the albums .
raw File Support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; maybe also deal with it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a specific camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support .
how to set it up and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow sections .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ rs ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is then used as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ came ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , re@@ distribut@@ able digital camera software that supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports these cameras and guides the transmission of pictures with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found on this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ cam can be reliably read . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , thumb@@ nails may not be possible or the generation could be very slow .
one of the nic@@ est things at &amp; digi@@ came ; is how easily its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ rs ; , K@@ DE album , sho@@ wi@@ mg and g@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much easier &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; or change to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drawing and dropping images works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the al@@ mine tree , above the horizontal separation distance or into another application window . the only restriction is that an image cannot be placed in keywords , date list or searching .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view . thus , the filter functions on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed can you configure in the dialog of the Al@@ location Settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My al@@ en@@ li@@ ste@@ alth ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos that are managed by &amp; digi@@ rs are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they have been created on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the al@@ mine properties or after the date the album was created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . choose album Import images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the destination album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection from you is used to sort your photos when you select After collection from the tool@@ bar or create albums After collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date sorting .
buttons Ol@@ dest , average , New Year : these set the date to one of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . this will first attempt to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
when you first open an album in &amp; edited , the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the album . it will help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview , select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports input of key words for individual photos in the area My keyword list on the left bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window gives you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all the images in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait short while the preview images are generated . you can avoid this by using the Extras All thumb@@ nail images in the Tools menu .
information on each image will be displayed below the previ@@ ew@@ ed preview . what information is this , you can change the settings dialog ; select the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nail area to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails feature help windows that appear . if you let the mouse poin@@ ter rest a moment over a picture , the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such an help window .
photos are everything about &amp; digi@@ came ; albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can reach all the functions that were done by &amp; digi@@ rs ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the pictures .
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... in the editing pane ; image editing you will find a guide how to edit your photos . with image editing you can view and modify your photos .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ ticks ; the functionality you need is not provided . you can open a photo in another program by using the context menu with right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of the file . to do this , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing , other image editing programs may cause problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . this means that information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; edited ; set two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click on the preview and select turning . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you maintain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo &amp; deleted ; delete , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete .
&amp; quot ; My date sli@@ me ; organize your photos based on data . &amp; digi@@ rs ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed .
photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo may be found by selecting this keyword or searching again .
if a keyword is selected , all the photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword list , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and allocated keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the keywords are re @-@ imported in the loss of the database as soon as &amp; digi@@ kam .
you can add new keywords using the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keyword , or click on an existing keyword and then choose New Key@@ word . if you add a new keyword after you cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this becomes the sub@@ son@@ ance of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and del@@ eting . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and put it down there . then appears a menu that gives you the option to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in a tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ click it and select keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in tree &amp; quot ; My keyword ; change .
to select another photo as an album symbol , click the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to take advantage of the functionality with keywords , you must first have your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos that you want to provide with a keyword , you can drag them to the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch . alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can give a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have added a photo with keywords , this will appear under the thumb@@ nail preview in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and remove from the Tags menu Rem@@ ove from the menu . the menu only shows the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved by this hist@@ ogram . in order to select a time frame , you only need to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame that speci@@ fies the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it will then appear in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all the images will be displayed again . if the search has not found , then the lamp turns red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple seek@@ er box as described above . however , you can save this search here as live search , which always filter what you entered as a search criteria .
if you are happy with your selection , press OK and search will be performed . the results will be displayed in My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select search , the form to enter the search appears again with the previously entered search information . if you select to edit as advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . here , you will find more rules for searching .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select search in the context menu Search .
the Advanced Search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; edited ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ mine database . all rules will be added to this list with search group / search group deleted or deleted . each option can be combined with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ...
&amp; edited ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows you to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop any image to find a similar one . by means of a threshold , the result range can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ plug ; find the matching pictures . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can drag in or zoom out or hold it while you move . move C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this is then added for a later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ Fol@@ der .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides a light table in a separate window where you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To add the lumin@@ aire from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and opened its window . if you are back in &amp; deleted ; main window , you can quickly open the illuminated table with L extras .
from the preview strip you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow will show you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you select a preview from the tool@@ bar and perform a zoo or move operations on one of the pictures , these are also executed in the other image . you can thus compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly fade out of a picture series . if you use pairing mode from the tool@@ bar , then both first images are automatically loaded into the fields to compare . use the left mouse button at any preview to display it in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images .
of course , normal del@@ e@@ tion operations also work directly from the light table , such as F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right @-@ hand side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to combine visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ v@@ elling function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to change the visible area of the image , you must click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode preview , both images will then show the same image area .
the zoom functions as well as in other views . just use the zoom knob under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are in the mode preview .
what is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion statement ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or stores digital photos leads through a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect , protect , convert , group , back , convert , group , backup , review , search , archive , optimize , maintain and export image files .
&amp; quot ; digital inventory management takes up , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ uses and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . according to your definition , metadata is data that provides information about or documentation of other data that is administered by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to find a particular photo without inventory management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use it not &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; . the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files ensures very fast searching and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive , etc .
vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . the remaining photos will be organized on the basis of your date . if you do enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separating file types makes batch processing easier . separate new ones from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend the metadata option to be stored in the metadata entry page &amp; Format . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? in addition , &amp; edited a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are , of course , the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should assign keyword words , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , since you can focus on the best photos during further work .
let &apos;s talk with keywords , keywords as you frequently call other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ ticks ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the pictures to the right place . changing the hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can easily be done by pulling a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ rs ; updated as the sub@@ trees are tra@@ cked .
the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation , as each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos just , you want to share it with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . far away is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it more closely , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mans 60 years after landing . wow ! you begin to dream , to have associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has completely changed your perception of this panorama .
for others who view your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer to help him over the motive that you moved has to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with an inscription for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . you can even set it for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you a spell ch@@ ecker .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to go to another city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it Earth a boring planet in Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now drives with light speed .
the possibilities of explo@@ iting ge@@ olo@@ cation are already countless and will become deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels via pictures with geographical indications . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps Viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a copyright and describes the practice of using copy@@ rights in order to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also applicable in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be deposited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , for example , to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization may be used .
author title : associated with the author . this field contains the work description of the photographer . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here , which you provide the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or modify this image embedded in the picture . for private individuals this is very important for most of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these types of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss has .
of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that requires a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors even if you have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a controlling sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control environments . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and therefore almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
burn slowly with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ety format . then read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject : disk error study
the failure rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of defect , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect these errors . some of the errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT adver@@ sely indicate the imminent failure .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems .
while most electric devices do not make a lot of electric sho@@ cks , it looks different on devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed motherboard and other defects . therefore protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against spi@@ kes is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the power heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug connector . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms . some manufacturers produce over @-@ voltage cont@@ actors which also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the cable mode@@ ms co@@ axial cable and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . some models even allow them to continue working until the current is running again . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the included software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety with the costs of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be you up to &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can integrate it as a drive on &amp; Linux , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer allowing you to store any amount of data .
however , compared to the hard drives at home , they are very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send data on the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
the web solutions are very safe from the point of view of data backup . transmission errors are automatically corrected thanks to the TCP protocol and with large companies there is a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all trans@@ missions are prone to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing about it is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . nobody seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors a year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate failures on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux , and Windows .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss for not@@ ebook and 46 % for desktop systems . for not@@ ebooks , the share of the@@ fts is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage than for example theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has not been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : false , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : un@@ true , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . however , if a file was not fully stored before the problem appeared , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . this means that while the technology continues to develop , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deterior@@ ates . a sensor size of 6 Meg@@ api@@ xel and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not blame anyone else for data loss . therefore , secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like re@@ installing your operating system , changing sheets or changing the size of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash will hit you if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane crashes : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , des@@ aster pro@@ phyla@@ xis always means non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common cause of data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two times : that of the complete backup and the last differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made . this backup comes closest to a version@@ ing system , with the exception that it is only sam@@ pled and not running continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ driven FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only the difference of files that have been really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium .
this procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for the backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
themes : metadata , stored in the image file , IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , using the Internet .
so that valuable images survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way to make a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command whether your new disk was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
/ dev / s@@ d@@ c # resource is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # resource is / dev / s@@ d@@ c and dollar ; Par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ O ; # functions with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # modify the size of call if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not exist any software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task becomes easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that is slowly dis@@ appearing from the market , so you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG is designed as an open source standard which should replace GI@@ F . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store g@@ amma and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color allocation in hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF is widely distributed as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( de@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , it is a problem that this format was adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG is developed on the basis of the need to uni@@ fy the camera formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already providing D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block &amp; quot ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive the original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP works as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , there may be problems connecting the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , the raw format is obsol@@ ete . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard links and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images on the camera system are , you can use it as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fine editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze , then you should add the metadata again . these may be cut off from the other programs .
protect the edited pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export them to web galleries , code into m@@ peg , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; edited ; in the section Ad@@ ding a photo to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your disc database .
to use your digital camera &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . for some cameras it can take a while . when the connection is established , a fer@@ al indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed .
before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page accompl@@ ishments and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Met@@ als Met@@ adata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , Manufac@@ turer &apos;s notice , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as the Met@@ adata page strip from the main window of &amp; edited ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is by clicking the button download and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; edited ; . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures were safely downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos you can select the desired selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then Download Sel@@ ected . download the Sel@@ ected button as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New Download is available . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
when you use the buttons All download or download selected albums , a dialog appears in which you can select the destination album in which the photos are placed . the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums section . select the destination album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the destination album , press OK , &amp; &amp; edited ; upload the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can all delete them at once by del@@ eting the Clear All button . if you only want to delete some , you must first select them and then delete selected del@@ e@@ tion .
please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera . you should therefore carefully check if the photos were successfully removed from the camera ; so you should carefully check if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do so using the camera &apos;s menu , as this is much faster .
cameras often use not particularly meaningful names for the photos . the file names are normally re@@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can result in dup@@ licate fil@@ en@@ ames in case you download photos from different shooting series into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image has been taken into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically .
the options Whi@@ le the transfer opens three more options that are executed before the photos are saved on the disk . the first two concern the data about the author in the standard auto identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo @-@ % Y@@ - % % % % H : % M : % S . for further adjustments , you should read the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you are using the option camera file name , you have the option of modi@@ fying the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case , or in upper@@ case letters if you prefer this .
the new file name , edited &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the next time the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and when your camera does not provide this information , &amp; digi@@ came ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the extension button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date the photo was taken , &amp; edited ; this to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section , you can check which information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case , &amp; edited ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you must switch on this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select up@@ loading . the file selection dialog box appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ r asks ; you , where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear . select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in length and width graph and which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it may be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ cam ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 serves many GPS data fields , such as direction , ar@@ tic and card references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a re@@ working of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ o classification ( manual ) and last about manually setting up known locations .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few working with GPS receivers . either as a map module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to save these data in the g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the module for ge@@ o @-@ classification .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same on &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the acci@@ d coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle e.g. .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; edited ; try to give as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; edited . to access these settings , you must select the settings dialog . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select action can be displayed on Embedded Pre@@ view or Edit Image Processing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ came ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . also in case of a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC data fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for the author : this field should contain the professional description of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to indicate which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if this is for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here because this is the picture other &amp; quot ; . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here .
IP@@ TC &apos;s actions save the data to the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the &amp; edited version ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; edited ; imported without losing .
save image descriptions in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . this way , your cap@@ tions can also be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor rests in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify what file types &amp; digi@@ rs have been attempted , you can add and remove file extensions of this list .
you can reset the default settings by clicking the Update button on the right of each category .
the &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; can be set to the default values on this page . however , each time you open the LED , these settings are turned on when possible . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar when you use the image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the more detailed explanation .
with P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , because P@@ NG requires a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the TI@@ FF file option , you can switch the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality as the Def@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
you can save loss@@ less JPEG 2000 files loss@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setup , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported but was in the planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ rs ; image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . at the moment it is developing very quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the image editing settings .
the default is that all green pixels are the same . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensi@@ tively to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd rows , this difference creates a grid pattern in output . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the peak lights , so the parts of your images that are burned @-@ in due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights as a continuous white . the setting colors trigger some unusual results , since it shows the pointed lights in various Ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible since blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; red@@ w ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the option re@@ constructing , you will get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should / should be individually adjusted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the &amp; edited ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the demo icing down small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a demo @-@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that comes from the color @-@ filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of color pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ ming Construction .
&amp; digi@@ came ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ic Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color arti@@ facts on the edges .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening correction , as it is done during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; edited ; information such as colour information from one color space to translate into the other , so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image editing / color management module with raw files .
color Profile Fol@@ der Set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; edited ; examine this folder during startup .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the opportunity &amp; quot ; standard source ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not include any color mapping or gam@@ ma@@ correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not correct conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to carry out the color mapping yourself .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile you can em@@ ulate on how your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before printing image as your printer can have a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore highly satisfied . this could you manually correct instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for . unfortunately , not on the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of image viewers and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ came ; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use and those are then deleted by &amp; digi@@ rs ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Short commands .
more information ( in English ) on K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper control adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which is displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the display .
the camera features show on the left side a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button automatic detection which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in image display mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn it on .
check if &amp; digi@@ come ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window &apos;s menu . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the confirmation dialog box for moving images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can display &amp; edit the del@@ e@@ tion of &amp; edited ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and del@@ eting an album , you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; applied if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any questions . otherwise you need to save the changes using the button changes .
you can also display &amp; edit &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze the welcome screen ; under certain circumstances , this will speed up &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze the startup process ; .
when you are looking for new or deleted albums / photos , you can search for new or deleted albums / photos . this will extend the start time of &amp; digi@@ rs ; if something has been deleted from the base folder , &amp; edited ; you will be asked if it will delete them from the database .
different color schemes can be found in &amp; edited ; these settings can be used to match the main window to your taste . you can select these settings from the tool@@ bar under Set@@ ting Design . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ came ; create , find more information on this in this tutorial .
&amp; edited ; includes quick image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and for correction and enhancement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on previ@@ ew@@ ing an image or by the context menu of previ@@ ew@@ ing and selecting the item Ad / Edit .
image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ rs ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , please refer to section Image Processing .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fying factor , and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly required functions .
editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or save the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or Rest@@ ore the button Rest@@ ore the image processing Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last saving .
almost every action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by editing back and re@@ covering by selecting Edit Players from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and mark C@@ tr@@ l ; Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment longer via the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter and zo@@ oming in the photo in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel , or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : automatically select the magni@@ fying factor
view Full screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , the tool@@ bar will also be displayed . if you do not want this , you can call it in the &amp; edited entry dialog ; you can view it from the &amp; edited ; main window . see the section for setting up image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole sentences . you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Express Assistant . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; edit ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click on the same tab , letting the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge again .
in the label view , you can enter or insert let@@ tering with unlimited size . note the remark below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are de@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling panel in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented on it , use either the Apply button or simply change to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
next to the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the Evaluation section indicates a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sor@@ tations . it can be applied either with a single mou@@ sec@@ lick on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate several images at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the Ur@@ gency IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword is shown by a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this &amp; edited ; session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . this allows you to quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords with a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate box @-@ fields in the tree . all keywords of an image are keyword stored in the keyword keyword keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , If you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section .
the side bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search results . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . as a result , a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off under settings Vari@@ ous .
if you have a rule with and created and realize that it would have to be one or it , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an extended search on all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly took it to &amp; edited ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resemble those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results that he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide you with links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image issues are by email or the web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and thus worry about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to cal@@ libr@@ ate my monitor if I have decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you must co@@ al@@ locate your monitor since s@@ RGB suggests that your ; on@@ itor is based on s@@ RGB , then you have to use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve one image in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , balance , automatic contrast and contrast extend from the Cor@@ rec@@ tan@@ king automatic corrections menu to automatically make the best of your colors . you &apos;ll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the brightness values over the whole picture , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed .
similarly , almost every brightness range has the same number of pixels . this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic matching : this method maxim@@ izes the ink range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and bright boundary tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
contrast enlarge : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a rer@@ e@@ aling of all values in between . this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly limited as over a colour gam@@ ut with 8 @-@ bit per color is used . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be customized in size . on the left hand side , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the destination picture has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the right , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your total is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow alignment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the preview to use the chosen color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the Pre@@ ferences list . the following settings are available :
the exposure indicator will increase the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is exposed . you will get the combined result in white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set can save you in a text file and load it back later .
the default setting reset all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is available only for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted from the color management chapter .
another important tool is to find color correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously so that you can use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same error and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool colour effects provide you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that arose when using a partially developed pressure a short flash light and then completing the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second light . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity is controlled by the Solar@@ isation . at approximately 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , it beauti@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it the film of choice for nature photographers .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos . you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all of your adjustment can be viewed in preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the opposite problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple signal strength / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool barrel correction is located to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue to this tool works very complicated , you only need the section of the slider for the application explained here .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , hist@@ ogram , active channel or selection range . under the graph , three slides are cli@@ cked into that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controller and make sure that the picture changes .
on the right , the original and the thumb@@ nail of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically using the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box , you can set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear display is often the most useful . in pictures the large ranges of a constant color , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic division is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lower for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color twe@@ ets can be used in preview of the original image to automatically adjust the entries of the shadows , middle and light tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as in the input value . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is in the foreground .
automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and re@@ charged later . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
when you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input file is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the entries of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result .
below you can see an example for adjusting entries to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be shown . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand side , the following options are available :
modi@@ fier channel : this box allows the channel to be specified and modified by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images that have been recorded with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most sensible . for images with large ranges of a constant color , the linear mode creates a broad beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels are darker .
when you move this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line will appear on the curve depicting the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , means and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black and white photograph that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; edited channel mixer ; image editing is a tool for improving the color channels or changing the color shades of the image .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool for mixing the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window shows you a preview .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are below : controls for Red , Green and Building allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you also activate the Mon@@ ochro@@ me option as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . color bre@@ wing consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise patterns appear different in each channel . if this is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color bre@@ wing first .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of its ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , because color images can easily be converted to the computer .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day . similarly , like the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and enhances contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of the absence of a pressure and the re @-@ development in a squ@@ am@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; edit ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to one image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop kind portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to be seen . the parameter of relief has been set to 200 .
with &amp; edited ; adding tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of an observer in the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired type of frame for your image . the image is rounded off with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , rounded off with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a fi@@ ery effect and decorative , adding a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before use .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text execution , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need them . the bigger the image , the bigger the character set must be . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
any settings you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK &quot; . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with &amp; edited ; apply tool sten@@ cil to put a template over a picture .
the template template apply in image editing can be used to place sten@@ cil over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you must use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to decrease the file size of the template . if you want to add your templates to &amp; digi@@ kam , just send an email in english to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ rs @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button root folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder was set for the sten@@ cils , a tree view appears which reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . the selection of a folder automatically updates the preview strip of the sten@@ cils .
beneath the thumb@@ nail are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inks : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces gran@@ ular images especially in dark areas .
blu@@ r mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact it sharp@@ ens a bit , it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is perhaps the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
images without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digital@@ isation process needs to be summ@@ arized with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn causes sharp edges to be printed together . SL@@ R cameras typically require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images , a camera is often used for internal sharpen@@ ing . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a field of sharp@@ ness while reading the image . if you disable this , you get control over your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a picture with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can invo@@ ke the desired results using the menu entry .
you should be careful with this as the results do not work very naturally : sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most suitable technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . you will reach it via the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t . you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too tight . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool to mark the soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or amount ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the blur@@ red mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats will produce close to sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . they should therefore best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applying difference amount . thus one can define a minimum difference thereby for an edge of the filters applied . in this way areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty fla@@ ws in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool re@@ focuss@@ ed re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected design filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienn@@ ese filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ r mask . re@@ focus usually reaches better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by focusing colors re@@ focusing in image editing .
in practice , the circular fold is much better than the gau@@ ze &apos;s fold . the gau@@ ze &apos;s fold has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ ies removed far from the original source pixel . in most cases the FI@@ R Vienn@@ ese In@@ verse of the G@@ auss &apos;s folding is influenced even very strongly from the distant pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . the filter can accept values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 , the image quality is very poor . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 .
indul@@ gence &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the gau@@ ze &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your blu@@ r is &apos; g@@ auss &apos; . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non @-@ zero value , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can generate good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gauge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all blan@@ ks , color and intensity adjustments on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before changing the picture in any other way . the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not visible immediately , which later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , Un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by the blur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used than sharp@@ ness .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the blu@@ r . for the Vienn@@ ese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Line@@ ar filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Vienn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of correction in digital pictures , you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address .
the knob smoo@@ ths the sharp@@ ness of the area that has been obs@@ cured in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the color ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the rest@@ au@@ ration process . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smoo@@ th@@ ness over the picture . whereas larger values mainly smoo@@ then smoo@@ thes and details . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . note that the detail conservation should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction depen@@ dency .
directional depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 can only be smoo@@ thed in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD noise , a high value produces wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary , if very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ b@@ ish effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle @-@ step width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be selected small . therefore , make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing , and never larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more the quality you get by selecting this option is only low , but it doubles the run@@ time . therefore , we recommend it to om@@ it it .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and drag a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button demo@@ lition .
the module is applied to a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a strange black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a poor film deposit during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tion ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hairs on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can stay with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters are needed per pixel and can blu@@ r the image . the area indicated by the radius is smoo@@ thed over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and therefore smaller bugs fixed .
sharp@@ ness : controls the field of sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , noise peaks are deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer get image details and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : check the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ bl@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas typically more severely smo@@ thered . however , it also s@@ me@@ ars the shadow areas .
absorption : controls the adjustment of the phase damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ous density . if it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high . if it is to its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter appear at the edges . it can remove smoke spi@@ kes and is the recommended method for it .
save and load : these buttons are used for this purpose . all the noise reduction parameters you set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; edited ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo arti@@ facts .
this filter for restoration allows you to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that emerge in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture sub@@ stitution . the texture of texture is performed with another tool , the image error correction , the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ con@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss @-@ ha@@ sty compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ ts@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . any type of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and re@@ charged later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Be@@ am .
below you can be restored like a photo with uni@@ form@@ alized noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film grain on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , textures are reduced to an old color photograph that has been sc@@ anned with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by the scanner lighting and the phot@@ op@@ aper . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; edited ; tool Hot@@ mail allows Hot@@ pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression of hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; light Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark@@ room sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the dark@@ room button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and light pixels . these will be highlighted in the preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you capture the dark directly in order to detect new hot or light pixels by CCD mal@@ functions .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard shows the last dark and will automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are lifted out in all preview areas .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ cut : an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a one @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image can be seen below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sing ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially the medium and large photo format , can often not even illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) it can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there .
there are also disadvantages . many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed in such a way that it is impossible to hold the camera by hand . wide angle lenses should also use an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as there would otherwise be blur@@ ring effects caused by motion .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and color depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ Filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a raw image made without this filter . the tool vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applies the transformation with a Cent@@ er@@ Filter onto a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a lumin@@ ance of 2 .
brightness , contrast and g@@ amma setting : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixel . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image editing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . an image and contrast correction was also carried out with this tool .
the &amp; edited ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distortion . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s along the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth degree adju@@ sts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be eliminated virtually .
general : this value controls the strength of the second degree distortion . with negative values , distortion @-@ like distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the fourth degree . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners &apos; parameter has the in@@ verse sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ umes the image size and thereby performs a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
bri@@ gh@@ tens : this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview displays the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the ton@@ n@@ - and cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as the first . if you cut an image anew and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the distortion / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them with the blan@@ king tool in the menu Transform@@ ers from image editing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs , such as pictures from front , frame and painting , is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the image have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image can be seen below ( 1 ) and the corrected figure below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating inf@@ ra @-@ red film from the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website , which can be reached under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can set two parameters for film grain and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . when you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film , the ISO regul@@ ator changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
the filter color channels are mixed for the reproduction of infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , because the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Fil@@ tr@@ ation Fil@@ tr@@ ation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers blend great silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the filming effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back to the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gra@@ iny sight specially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed one ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity matches ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still lif@@ es are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smoo@@ ths controls the smoo@@ th@@ ness or , from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel wide image is 1 and smoo@@ ths 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sing ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sketch . the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you . these would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts contrast ( smoo@@ th@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the char@@ coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter Grav@@ ure shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; engraving is a fast tool to re @-@ enter your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distor@@ tions . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and lets it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Be@@ am .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blu@@ r effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom infin@@ ity : blur@@ ring the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one center . this simul@@ ates the blu@@ r of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sport photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels to a central point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blu@@ r : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to res@@ ign in the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal motion of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photos taken from a car or train , camera .
sof@@ tening blur@@ r : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ or photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness blur@@ r : blur@@ red the image by moving the pixels , thereby simul@@ ating the blur@@ ring of a moving camera .
intelligent blu@@ r : find the color pools in the picture and blur@@ ts them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Be@@ am .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your image . this gives it natural your images a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright @-@ protected algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the visual effect of drops on the picture .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; image editing will keep an area free from rain drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . the tools for this can be found in the menu Transform@@ ers Tur@@ ning or Transform@@ ers .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job here .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
the size change tool uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixel . if you want to increase a small image with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photograph was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary , if very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ b@@ ish effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each copy can be saved as a text file and re@@ charged later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Be@@ am .
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard aug@@ mentation for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . in order to trim a photo you simply need to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and raising the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo is cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rect@@ angle . create a new rect@@ angle by simply pulling it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button En@@ cut button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or Save file under the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview section , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned .
the tool After aspect ratio cuts a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
in the dialog box , you can use the Max . ratio button to set the area for cutting to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
when you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are shown as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the Pre@@ ferences Manager settings make it easy to blend in so that you can better compose your images . these help include :
harmonic triangle : harmonious divi@@ des are based on the simil@@ arity principle . like the third @-@ part re@@ ins , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden center : the golden center is a division divided into different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden ratio in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where any number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two preceding figures .
the golden center provides more fluid guides when you put together an image . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spi@@ ral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ part rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition leads the gaze of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow in this way .
a further rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . there should be something that the eye drops into the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this can simply be there without leading the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the Golden Tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , gold tri@@ angles are not a tri@@ angular tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to place on these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic .
when you use gold tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach otherwise .
the Horiz@@ ont@@ ally and Ver@@ tical Options can be used to mirror the harmonious divi@@ des .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the guides can become invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it happens easily that you keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates an image in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tion ; image editing and tool free rotation . choose to convert Free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your picture with slide angle . the values on this slider are given in degrees . with the default setting , you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window .
to your help , the Free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have shot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Transform@@ ers cut out of the image processing .
an elegant way to trim the image is the Automati@@ cally trim function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the picture a bit after the rotation . note however the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . preview is then automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is blur@@ red a little . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ations cut out of the image processing .
the tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module by transforming sciss@@ ors .
rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can rotate horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles will be reset to zero . preview the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview window .
to your help a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the she@@ ar , the picture is blur@@ red a bit . for a single shaving this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two alloys produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has blur@@ red tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformation from the image processing .
&amp; edited ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats then depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ rs .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF .
&amp; digi@@ came ; shows only files in formats that know . this is done based on the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is specified in the list , &amp; edited ; you can change this list of file extensions ; you can change this list of file extensions ; in the configuration section , you will find more information on this .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; edited ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression procedures on digital images . redundant information is reduced to save image data to a more efficient way in this way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to know more about the raw image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the image converter from &amp; digi@@ rs ; in the configuration section , you will find more information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
&amp; digi@@ came ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which was included in &amp; edited ; hereby more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be seen below on the website of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw data edited by &amp; digi@@ rs ;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . &amp; edited ; these clips are often generated in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; edited ; but is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in options to display or edit movies .

many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; deleted ; your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tw@@ ood , noise reduction , re@@ focusing , blur@@ ring , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that indicates the effect in preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ lic@@ quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture . links of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally divided without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower one compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview window and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to display over and under exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image you want to view . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side pane features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can drag in or zoom out or hold it while you move . move C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ h@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pallets file . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to select and nam@@ ing colors .
the P@@ allets , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de , can apply either to the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot custom colors and Sets used colors .
in the Palette Editor , you can select from a list of installed pallets , or browse the folders after files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the palette view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the pallet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color black@@ board at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing has been selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check box over@@ writing under the cur@@ sor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last paragraph can be used along with the actions Cop@@ y , Cut and In@@ sert .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character , if another color follows . if so three numbers are in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then select it in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graphics viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; graphics . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , in particular in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program included , according to the program author out@@ dated &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphics viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphics viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphics viewer ; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; &amp; &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; kate ; recre@@ ates the graph and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; kate ; Open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ Graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; kate ; Compon@@ ent
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphics viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . requires in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only contains the symbol file and the ( empty ) list Rec@@ ently opened files . click on the first icon to view the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or automatically select this position .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed and Alt key ; - key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the newly uploaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph is to be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ Graph@@ viewer ; if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ Graph@@ viewer ; set up ... use , see also .
if you open a Graph@@ ite file outside a running &amp; k@@ ven@@ revi@@ e@@ --@@ -@@ instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards .
at program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ ene coming to a page will be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph distributed across several pages without head@@ line and with a different font
the Renew@@ al load page gives the option of setting the behavior when a file was modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
the Open page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ Graph@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time it is asked .
the session administration page gives you the option of setting the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphics viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or choose to be asked for each start .
the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up new possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of directional graphs . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .

the K@@ IP@@ I module insert images provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that is supported by the SA@@ NE project or another source such as video streams . to enable this to work you must have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE installed .
when you open the menu item images , a dialog appears which allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default value duc@@ ts in order to select your image accordingly . look at the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will show you in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after pressing the button Scan you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears . please remember that type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image by saving the image .
you can create screen shots after you have selected in the Im@@ ported - &gt; screen shot in the menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :

Fli@@ ck@@ r allows you to send photos to people that are important to you . you can show your favorite photos of the world , place your camera &apos;s photos online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the ex@@ porting module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . it is used for your authentication , so it &apos;s your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started to allow you to log in with Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successfully logging in , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r &apos;s website . you will be presented the following page after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have cli@@ cked on Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r , which will be shown in the next section .
if the module exports to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . at the moment , the module does not support other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options . using this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . clicking on the O@@ k button starts up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
the Tags field can be filled with a comm@@ a @-@ separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during upload .
with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can set the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at Maxim@@ al size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module export is a tool for ex@@ porting your image collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I Module export module currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format@@ . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can combine a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and enter the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . in order to run a possible correlation between time and location , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file contains of course data recorded at the same time at the same locations as the pictures of your camera .
when the file is loaded there is an automatic correlation that indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be performed with the time zone .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have track data from one place for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location is in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can place these limits here and then push the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog box is the coordinates of one call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set using the map displayed . select the region in question and enlarge it again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages conform to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the Ri@@ der selection allows you to select all the albums that want to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the preview and the text displayed in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ X@@ HTML , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nail thumb@@ nail allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press C@@ anc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not automatically be closed . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during production . the web browser will automatically be started at the end to preview the preview . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing pictures .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and sc@@ outs . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool for changing images without compromising your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is increasing because no compression of the color information takes place . this is also found in the P@@ NG file .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera Kli@@ ent currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the C@@ IP@@ I Met@@ adata Editor does not currently have any documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org .
with the Met@@ adata module import function , you can copy data from one image to another . to do so , select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please refer to ex@@ i@@ v2 to see what formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the m@@ peg enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images that should be packed in the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . then you can create the module via Tools MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the images you select are then listed among image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
after you are happy with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value produces sudden , high contrast , very smooth picture changes .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG file output file .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , this is integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie with the button code . depending on the speed of your machine you can now go fast or in all tranqu@@ ill@@ ity a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you &apos;re back .
if a suggestion appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the button settings on the right .
the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also automatically be opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module directly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BA conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have effect .
as soon as you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
the Tagged image format , TI@@ FF , retains all information of your image and uses the loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or later use them elsewhere , you should not choose the JPEG format , because there are only a limited number of operations before image quality is deterior@@ ating . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a memory format , the metadata that is included in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion using the Exec@@ ution button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use ab@@ ort .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing in a single image which is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing files automatically . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the image smaller or enlarge .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
propor@@ tionally ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . aspect ratio is changed with this option .
printing preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo ID . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before . more pictures can drag and drop to the list of images to be sent .
after you have started the module , the image window will display the images you pres@@ elect . you can add more pictures using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be shown on the right @-@ hand side .
you can also drag and drop pictures to the list of images to add them to the list of images to be sent .
removing the images will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the images you can open the New message window of your email client using the OK button . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you select are already attached as attachments .
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
select your Email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify in the input field below the correct path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and enclosed by the mail .
the P@@ NG file format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to sending images .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically be closed so that you can view the status messages in the search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow appears a window with questions about how you want to have your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the option file name indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner while the presentation is displayed .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a continuous loop . afterwards , you can manually cancel it using Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the images used in the album .
the distance between the images can be set between the pictures . 1500 mil@@ lis@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test it before presenting your friends !
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose . by chance , each transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slide show you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn on .
with this tool@@ bar , you can pause and restart the presentation , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show .
at the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not currently have documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop .
this module converts the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have noted your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by comparing with the image , now are available in each group , thus in people , places and in group keywords entries .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have added your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
when you press the mouse with the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the pictures you see are shown on which both persons can be seen . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of activity .
in the image each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person a thumb@@ nail image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture below .
to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right outside of the tool@@ bar . in the context menu you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you must specify which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you must open the Image startup window ( described in more detail ) and select the category editor in the context menu . in the View window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you enter the search entry in the main window , a dialog appears , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog on the image again .
if you enter a string in the lab@@ eling or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use an area of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can search all pictures by certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures on which Jes@@ per , however , are not shown Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the User Manual for &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo in case you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry to start the photo@@ album ; then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; try it .
if you prefer to print out this manual , please visit the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this strip you can see here : . as the name implies , this strip shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database .
each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed items preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will show you this date in preview ) and also the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time indications . if you select an area , only images of this period are displayed in the preview pane . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a log of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; introduces two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described , which you can create via the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description containing the HTML file later . on photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings .
next , select whether you want to create a photo@@ album ; export file to be created on the overview page . you can find more information on the export files in .
la@@ stly , you can select which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all pictures are of a party . note that all pictures are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why they are not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . that way , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 will not download any images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you have fixed . so you can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this settings area , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
for all of your HTML files , select a base folder and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and added automatically next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can either select a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be launched . the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . in order for the import function , see , properly works , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the just described settings have all three based on base folders and URLs . in them , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in output folders .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you may want to create your pictures with these . however , if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . , you have to start with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not do any more .
with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are exported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is just a link to images . the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the images together and that you can share this file as independent . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file scans the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the .@@ k@@ im file will be searched . this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
the following is the dialog for ex@@ porting images , which you can invo@@ ke in the Export menu .
the most important feature of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
with the manual close to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally close to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is limiting maximum image size . if you send your friends pictures , you might want to send the pictures not in full size , since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Export menu ... select , will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in .
first you have to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you are the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is in your database people . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and which categories correspond to them in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database . you can see an example of this on the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) determining the information about your images , about ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . at many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but frequently it also includes videos .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS where they want .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; remember the folder in which your pictures are saved and use it automatically again in future starts . if you want to start a different folder tree with pictures , you can start your photo@@ album ; for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
the Settings k@@ photo@@ album menu entry allows you to set up a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the User Manual , the various settings are explained .
on the left , you will see six different icons with which you can view settings of previ@@ ews and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 button and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group you can select an inscription and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete groups of members , i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group rather than all groups of a member as explained in the section .
in the selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ plug and g@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be called through the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are used by multiple applications together , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database before you use them on your own pictures : demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . do not say I would not have warned you !
the applications using the K@@ IP@@ I modules are very different , whereby it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the down@@ side if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order for albums so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album .
this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album that simply fits the current view , so all the pictures that show you the preview of the picture right now .
in addition to the current album , you must also pass a list of albums . this is where you go and photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be used in the category you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you are using the category people , you will do a photo@@ album ; so do so , so whether you would have selected people to view it and pass it on to the module .
since some modules are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the Settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start your photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar , you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the entry images showing you an overview with all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to add comments to each image . this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture , where the image has been taken . for example , each image can be displayed individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures taken in Copenhagen were recorded .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text field by defining people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of your photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again and again , if you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can , by moving the names used up , locate and assign persons faster .
if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon to sort by date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and add notes . in this case , simply click the front and back buttons below the image to the right .
if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at one time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
in the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a sub@@ group . to show you that this is a group , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can also drag an entry into a category and put it there to make it a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and moving the buttons that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by pulling it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to suit your needs , click on the Options ... button , which allows you to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also completely om@@ it a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options ... and then hide / hide windows . you will see this process in the picture .
if you select the images in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or of all images if you have not set a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button .
when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the image viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the picture preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Del@@ ete key or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now , the window will appear that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use pictures without having saved them on your hard drive . of course you need to have the pictures stored somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images from which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for the images 5 @-@ 9 . however , the thumb@@ nails are available for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 . however , you can &apos;t view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires that you copy files from the folders and copy them back . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; if you want to avoid trouble , such as the mess of your pictures , please buy a larger hard disk to store all the pictures on them .
in the menu item you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you would like to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures in such a way that at the end those who wish to make them in@@ accessible and click the latest view blocks in the Privacy Settings menu . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister may see , and choose the menu item All except current view .
with this you have specified which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , which will hide all the images you have locked . if you want to get the pictures to be displayed again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select Change Password in the Privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this image protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , all the images on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar , looking at private pictures .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to see them at some point . for this reason , photo@@ album has a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in the picture . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have in the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed . all of these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see the matching entries to this page . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the keys image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; then download a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus . started and stopped the slide show by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer to switch from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can drag in and zo@@ oms into the image . you can simply pull a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button you can zoom out again The Plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the dot @-@ key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown . with the equal key , the zo@@ oms sets so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom @-@ operations that work with videos means that they enter and zoom out with the plus and minus key .
with the shooting functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image using the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can view the pic@@ s and open configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark it as good or bad as you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to see images with characters while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter . in the picture you see a picture with which the characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have added features to your images , these are available in the browser . you can see this in the browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply add all of them at once . this is described in . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview . if you can view categories in the preview screen , you can add characteristics to the pictures by simply press the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see it here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you will allow you to paint on the picture .
the mixture will not be saved with the image , but in the database . in this way you can undo your painted later .
in you can see a picture on the painted . to switch on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the image from the context menu . to exit the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; you need to control the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but the documentation about &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views yellow is displayed .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ project of an object already selected , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to enable you to choose the correct position :
with Del@@ ete , either from the menu bar under Edit , or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to accept these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply , or disc@@ ard the changes with abor@@ tion .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as a default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross local .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these controls with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts .
each object has a vi@@ ability level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the level of visibility chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below a view , drag the link to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle will then display the new position .
to create a new column , pull the button on the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the An@@ f@@ asser in the middle of another view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the flash@@ cards at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to lo@@ osen a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , pull the An@@ f@@ asser on the desktop or click on the small left pointing arrow in the panel bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the connector bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place .
the current window view can be saved with view window arrangement ... it displays a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon In the tool@@ bar icon or select the menu entry View scene rendering .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes as you wish , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you select the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to use a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the picture , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section to render into the input fields .
in combination field quality , you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User Manual &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or scale effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . in general , pictures with this property look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling includes the neighboring pixels . the second method is adaptive ; recur@@ sive , because each pixel is continuously divided and adapted because the rec@@ ord@@ less depth depends on the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam of each pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the colours exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are further pursued and checked for further divisions . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called J@@ itter@@ ing . when you turn on J@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have not hit any object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly quit , you can find the reason here .
to import one &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; import the scene , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; Not yet the complete command tot@@ ale of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or aler@@ ts , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also paste .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene rendered . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in Property View , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . here , set the path to your retention and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type plate .
you can set the object reception of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in more accurate wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects , such as the sphere , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
if you tick High detail fi@@ del@@ ity for enhanced projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections . this feature results in better approach for projections , but requires more time to render .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern from two adjustable colours .
if you tick the floor , a bottom is row@@ ed below the objects . the bottom is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you tick to tick edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can adjust the values for depth and threshold value . more details about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window classi@@ fications . in the window instructions section , it explains how to create and save windows instructions .
the drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing window sizes . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of existing window classi@@ fications shows all existing window sizes . a new arrangement can be created by adding the button Add and del@@ eting a selected arrangement using the button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created by adding the button Add and Del@@ ete selected views using the button .
the position of the new window . with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with undo you get a map view view together with the previous view and floating the view not anchored in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without any more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene among beginners : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you will receive only one black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t include sources of light , your whole scene lies in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following set @-@ up window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation to get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should note the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . then select the scene and then select the menu entry Edit Del@@ ete . this way you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of rendering the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; see more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position .
when you click the Apply button or the input key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you might insert a header ( insert final body boxes ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the input key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also displays the plane , although at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . when you render the scene , the plane stretches out to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when you click on the item + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise one unit beneath the horizon line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something simple .
in both cases a dialog opens , in which you can select how the object should be inserted . please select First sub@@ item . the pigment will then change in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( Name = Ground pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the Pre@@ view of the pigment shows only a matt black material because you still need to enter settings for the pig@@ ments . therefore always remember that you can check the look of materials anytime with a click on Pre@@ view . also , there are many possibilities again , but take the easiest now .
if you do not see any color on the header and the ball in the preview , click on the Apply button and then preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you now render your picture with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . select this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to do this step , since you should have understood the basic mode of working of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button Apply ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would float above the floor as you have moved the base around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , the rendering gives a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface looks like a matt black material . in the following step , put in a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as in the ground , give the ball a pigment as color :
select first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ments . click on ball &apos;s pig@@ ments , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish features :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press En@@ ter .
the brightness @-@ effect and reflection adjustments already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good idea of the possibilities for you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical radi@@ ance from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will impact .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source , you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and memory space .
re@@ covers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the recently revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected when you have used Un@@ do Un@@ do .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ ride an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change or add new commands to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er with this option ; modify or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; add and remove commands .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without alter@@ ing any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed in either an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can display with the click of the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in your own window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialog submission - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the way of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be set for each window .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is enabled , the next image will load in the folder , while you are still viewing the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this will be used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is larger than the image , the background will also be filled with the selected color .
you can set &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so set up that only some of the file types that the program can display .
with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is switched on as default .
determines if the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 1 .
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened .
show the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the entry field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; &amp; ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&amp; show@@ Photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and make corrections and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ Photo ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes his part to report at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; make it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry reports you issues or wishes . this shows a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all necessary information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a more common user of &amp; show@@ Photos , then we would like to encourage you to answer the user mailing list of &amp; show@@ Photos . however , you can ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ Photos here . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to take part in &amp; show@@ Photo ; participate is to join the developer mailing list . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ Photo ; .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; try to give as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options to change the behavior of &amp; show@@ Photo ; in order to access these settings , you need to select show@@ Photo in the Settings menu . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can change between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . the colors with what you want to display are in contrast . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ Photo ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge which gives you important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side@@ bar in image editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer perform as images to scan and save .
&amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer can scan and save images . &amp; output ; can open a dialog for each image or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the information you need on this website : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; chant l@@ ite ; with the command output line &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not particularly address these options .
to scan a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ scan and then scan scanning range for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
once the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview in the settings selected , the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below . when pressed , the image will be saved and sc@@ are will result in a demo@@ lition and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be checked .
this setting allows them to select the type of image . dialog for saving for each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically to store with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save without searching for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this by the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix of the each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression threshold when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the knob lets the K@@ DE about -@@ Di@@ alogue for &amp; chant l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to termin@@ ate &amp; chant .

you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cut can be set up by right @-@ click into the player window and set global short@@ cuts , by right @-@ click into the player window and set short commands ... Select .
you can set up existing multimedia keys so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . this will make your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is supposed to describe the D@@ CO@@ P features of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function could be &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Amar@@ ok has some of its own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all needed modules are present and make use of the dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ruby ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages enable exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is mostly used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are written to standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure Wi@@ zard asks the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok uses the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is being played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P , the script could ask more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ is@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a custom menu entry was cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le are also provided for the script to use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; exit , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to perform tasks such as storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks Script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .@@ tar ) , which may optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend a archive name such as my@@ skri@@ p@@ t.@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extended amar@@ ine script . therefore , you should design@@ ate your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions :
if your script package is ready , you can download it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the Amar@@ ok category ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of working through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re looking for just a specific song from thousands in your collection . mit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Collec@@ ting browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have a few play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music .
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . for details , see System Pre@@ mis@@ es section .
enables de@@ bu@@ gging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in developing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without trouble through the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the player window will display the player window in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ service . the option switches on the experimental function of the m@@ oped .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
put mood files in the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored in the location folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is required .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
save play@@ lists while moving , the current playlist will automatically save while moving &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when moving .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will be used . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
to keep the current piece visible when changing the play , the playlist window pop@@ s up / un@@ rolls to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area .
changing the context browser automatically indicates the context browser as soon as the next play is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting custom fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray section will be enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ectors which are activated for foreground and background color .
resume playing at the start , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume play automatically with the piece at the place with which it was stopped during the last ending .
setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , preview the O@@ SD will appear and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shade causes the text to be shad@@ owed in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if own colors are not activated , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors are used .
the input field display text displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is designed for X@@ iner@@ ama users , allowing you to determine which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD is supposed to appear .
the card @-@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers enable even more configuration options in this card card .
the card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders .
recur@@ se sub@@ folders : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the selected as well as their sub @-@ folders will search for music .
super@@ v@@ ise changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is necessary in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup will be used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under Calcul@@ ator : will the machine enter where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then under Port : the network port where the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
username : and Password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the load file last@@ .@@ f@@ m sets the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and , if required , create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your load@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and so update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retri@@ eving similar performers : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar performers can be retri@@ eved from the played piece . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) .
some functions such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example , but flu@@ x@@ box will work hard . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and leave the collection again .
it is mostly because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all of the libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok have been compiled using the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , de@@ activate autom@@ . switch off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark this as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
and Amar@@ ok &apos;s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are forgotten .
if you get this error : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pixel , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can see this with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to make Amar@@ ok find the correct version first .
most of the installation problems are the easiest way to solve your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ co@@ de@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
bu@@ g@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter there only one error if you are interested in fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only appears an empty playlist . how come there pieces of music there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to intui@@ tively keep the interface , the start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statisti@@ cs window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the user &apos;s rating while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the app@@ rais@@ al column must be displayed in the playlist . click the title bar of the playlist and select column ads . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove From the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file into the playlist and drop it there , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the add @-@ button , the button playlist is stored . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ complex , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question needs to be loud What media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support virtually any imagin@@ able audio format .
it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 deco@@ ders are included in the pres@@ et ( for pat@@ ent@@ able reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 , input key
launch the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you are using the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa heat@@ sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved with a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in finding the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide a different sink ( for example , sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t simply send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either you do not use the Arts Driver , but instead use G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to get the faster arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts @-@ buffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller the buff@@ ers , the less dre@@ am@@ ers respond to visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes and Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all components . run register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok beforehand ! ) : - Download the ff@@ m@@ peg file , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a complete list of suggestions / requests , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . in addition , the name contains the magical K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run it with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are awak@@ ened by the soft sounds of the music you have stopped before going to bed .
how to get to know the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles when you &apos;re on a different computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the current piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ ip d@@ co@@ p --@@ user &apos;s user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ al@@ isations can be dis@@ connected from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button represents a piece in the click sequence in the queue . by pressing the input button after a search in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database can &apos;t be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on the audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired target folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , instead , take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg .

basically , this adju@@ sts the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the play has been played . the more often the piece is played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can add the review for a piece by clicking on a column header in the playlist window . click here to mark the rating . then you can change the app@@ rais@@ al of a piece just as all other attributes , namely by right click on the piece and click Edit : select Evaluation or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the metadata dialog .
the developers do not want you to tell you when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified release plan that cannot be brought together with the short @-@ term Amar@@ ok plan .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can find also ner@@ vi@@ g . disable the option icon when playing animated in the general settings .

Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ ber is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ ber is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supports .
if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes resulting in a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need to install and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably need a distribution that inst@@ alls the development files separately from the actual program . even though G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . you now have to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how to use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
set in Set@@ ting Amar@@ ok ... audio output you enter the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ resour@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug s@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; &gt; ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ li@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug s@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog by x@@ ine and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check@@ mark on sound card support m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be cared for further . of course you may take this problem yourself into your hands ! if you would like , you can become the new so much @-@ needed main@@ tainer for arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard which will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will be a help . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very easy . drag and drop items from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text box to filter the collection eases the search for certain pieces . if you &apos;re content with the playlist , you can save them by using the click of a button Save this button in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ lists window .
if you have your own playlist , you can add it to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the playlist to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . with a right @-@ click to a playlist , you &apos;ll get different ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select the Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files to the playlist and then press the Play button .
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burn feature is also available in the playlist . just click the right mouse button on one entry and follow the burn menu . you have here various options to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . furthermore , some additional packages are listed which make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages using a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . additionally , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all the others .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the currently running piece or the currently running stream . a click on this area will change the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining time of play .
the player window also includes a selection of Audio Analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can switch by the available Analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button in the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be dis@@ connected from the Player window . press d on your keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fiable window .
under the running text display are also the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window while the E@@ Q button is used to set equ@@ ali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the equ@@ ali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they are all easy to use .
in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right you can find the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context browser displays different information about the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . these three sub@@ windows will be explained later in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you might notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information presented there has now been split into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be collected in the Statisti@@ cs window ( Extras statistics ) .
the music below shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first area in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to sm@@ ash the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you will find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see here how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display covers in the context browser , the covers must be in the same folder as the current piece . file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng formats are supported . the context browser will also display covers that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favour@@ ites from this interpreter . this section shows the five most highly rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information in the music sub@@ window should be displayed . to do so , right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will fold up and you will see the content of the album .
you can click all the items in the individual sections to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , &amp; Amar@@ ok try to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if you do not have a text script , you can choose which one should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the song text . the modified version is then saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . for this , no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - groups only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are dis@@ regarded .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - first the pieces are arranged according to the artist and there is a further spl@@ itting according to the respective album . if you want to see con@@ stell@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different performers .
group@@ ing Artist / Year - Album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are displayed alphabe@@ tically among each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces are displayed first by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above but is additionally sorted by album under the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can adjust and match the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this might take a while .
directly under the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection box , with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you are available different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year . besides , you can of course also select your total collection , whereby the filter is practically switched off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options .
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and insert the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
app@@ ending to Play@@ list - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected songs as a playlist . they are asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the queue to transfer to the Media Player . for more details , see the Media Player Browser section .
Bur@@ n all pieces of this interpreter burn / burn CD - This will enable the selected pieces to be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files in the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the compilation - Mark@@ s the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among different performers .
undo - Change a album marked as a compilation back into a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be shown in different performers but again under the associated artist .
the playlist browser simply shapes the handling of many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
self @-@ created Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists are also possible . click Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart Play@@ list , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod model@@ ed by artist in the upper list view of the Media Player Browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list performer . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is complete , finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive connection for your iPod .
the tool@@ bar is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser you will find an address bar with which you can fetch music from a entered URL . for example , if you type tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ c.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press entry paste , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag the music from there into the playlist and drop .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping down . in the event the holding down of the Shift key may be helpful : this will automatically include deleted files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the playlist contains all of the pieces attached to you . you can change the order by simply drag the entries to the desired place with the mouse . once you enter there letters , only the pieces are displayed that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter , for example , one two three , the search will find all the entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter OR between the search terms OR , you search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR 3 . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three will be found ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose foot@@ prints : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This will search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something search for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then right @-@ click in the desired order in the entries . the entries will then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add to add play@@ lists to the playlist .
next follow the undo and restore buttons . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the center of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , magni@@ fying analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you have displayed in the player window over the right mouse button . you can set up this menu &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars there ... Select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . in addition , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval , a slider for playing position and playing time of the current piece will be displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , you can disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok using this menu .
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry hides a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your artwork images . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left @-@ hand side .
with the View menu , you can choose what to appear in the cover administration . select :
the queue management received your big entry into &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , a number next to the title appears in the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will be played : 1 will be played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( the details of setting up these follow later ) .

add pieces based on load@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ ber ) . this mode requires that some pieces already reside in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist work .
double click the desired playlist , drag it to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select Lo@@ ad . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di Rand@@ om@@ ly Mix and Play@@ list mix immediately complete your playlist and you can start playback directly . the video playlist begins with an empty playlist and you need to add at least one piece to your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece of play , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : dynamic mode settings . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . the same menu entry allows you to disable dynamic mode again .
the new button re@@ fills the current playlist and adds new songs according to dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . as a result , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique in order to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the settings for upcoming pieces will be ignored and you will not hear a tune in that playlist . however , if the setting is active , the pieces already played will be removed in consideration of the pla@@ ym@@ ate pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were played recently .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will grow continually because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick more than one playlist , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add random songs from each of the selected play@@ lists .
some scripts make your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click on Set@@ ting .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Inst@@ all scripts by installing a script . it will open a selection dialog where a script package will be installed . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . you can also use the Other Scrip@@ ts button .
if you do not want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete , then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to section Writ@@ ing Scrip@@ ts .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins is used to enable the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plugin , simply enable the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start Guide is designed to show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b in four steps . to understand the steps , you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 or other los@@ sy compression formats then remember that you will receive a worse quality when re@@ encoding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created from a loss@@ less format .
in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
this Quick Start Guide is designed to show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Cop@@ y CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog box that looks like this :
in this dialog box , you can trace the progress of the copy process . once you have finished reading the original into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to burn the data .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
to fix this problem , start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the library search path ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org , where you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , where you can get feedback from the forums and get news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a flow ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; therefore choose &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; typically auto &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; typically automatic &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality at burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet , such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition with MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 En@@ co@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible , for example , to de@@ code WMA files and then burn them onto an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by So@@ x Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ MA : a fully featured author system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful e.g. for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without a norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the in@@ toxic@@ ating effect that the music pieces play differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to launch from CD and automatically re@@ play all the videos in the CD &apos;s base folder .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed with which you can choose folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
save all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file saving .
includes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . besides , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to happen , just as if you were called for each project file .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each un@@ saved project it is asked what to do with it as if you were calling file closing .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the dialog window . this has the same effect as when you view the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the CD &apos;s base folder .
this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described via the What is the ? remedy ( available via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you do not use files for a multi @-@ session CD .
this entry will only appear in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy from a CD , which you can then burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this allows the copying of a DVD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy from a DVD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , you can &apos;t support the copy / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copying dialog , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
open the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD + R ( W ) , which will completely delete the contents . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you make the choice between writing modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , for this you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges .
this information is displayed in the content view and features the properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is selected , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and un@@ locking the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the content view allows to select and drag files to the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view .
the header is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key signature for that further down .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator privileges are required , so you must type the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be set . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and nature of your task is crucial , which of the contribut@@ or programs you prefer .
in this chapter we assume that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have common all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts , which are described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Audio CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void proc@@ e@@ C@@ d@@ image ( ) void Bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void Bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project approach , one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , one can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void err@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void err@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void err@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string path ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; select for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be read audio CD ; s read out and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the U@@ I of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that enco@@ ded these WAV files ( compression ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) are supported by default ( These enco@@ der packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into MP3 or O@@ GG format or in other formats such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually already available for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is most likely not necessary to compile anything yourself . however , only the enco@@ der packages must be installed that are needed . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
what enco@@ der / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , use &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy protection . if not the Firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device avoids the protection , it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setup must be done only once ( but the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , then the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD ; on the hard disk explains . this ( hopefully ) will lead to an understanding of the slim approach of the user interface that you will stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , everything is manually collected .
this is just a short list of commands from the main window . on the step by step , for example , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program .
the CD@@ DB requests the CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - if an enco@@ der was configured in the Set Settings tab in the setup catalog - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . note that before the enco@@ der settings in the setup dialog , the enco@@ der was configured in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( like logs , pic@@ s ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; completed ) .
opens the main directional dialogue by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as En@@ co@@ der , for setting up the En@@ co@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes audio quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der .
if no audio information is lost , loss@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may now have a light advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit@@ rate the differences become less important because both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG to slightly lower quality for lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or machine based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets exists .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see the &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you don &apos;t want to have the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information obtained manually or retri@@ eved by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be passed / used with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program preferences for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button identification in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of entering the machine itself . it is important to note that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of translator : this is the author ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is active to select an address field ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b may be used with another ( forged ) address than the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears that the email address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( but this can only be the programmer who has reviewed the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only updates of the database .
which selection program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia will be used ; if you want to know more exactly , search the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution needs to be installed first if this has not been done yet .
for the first opening there are pre @-@ defined l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the enco@@ der package must be installed by the respective Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ders .
after installing a enco@@ der , you can receive more information about its switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . this must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der .
this can have many causes . check the device designation of the &amp; CD ; / DVD disk , the write and reader review on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ der of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this won &apos;t work !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you are using other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood it all but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; read . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; trying to copy it into the / usr / share / cd ) .
the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , something that will probably only be done once , and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each tap@@ ing &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ der to use for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) and the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any time you read a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the reader program , so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device designation of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device labels for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the tab General Settings . here there is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is as loaded / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of incomplete information ask for information so that you will be informed if statements are missing for the creation of keywords ( tags ) .
the box CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the machine must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD ; it must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found begins immediately reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you later are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory names / file names or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory and fil@@ en@@ ame will be changed with kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode , consider this twice whether this is worthwhile . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for data enquiry , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . however , this option will work as the first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , but as many fire@@ walls are bo@@ oting the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . to disable the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of pieces at the same time : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try it yourself .
disc@@ ard CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : check this to the CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the box is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something yourself with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is approximately 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted as needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of WAV files at the same time : with a du@@ al@@ core or qu@@ ad or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can try to code more than one WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have clever@@ ly chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section it describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the disk runs on the hard disk . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the internet is set up because we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process described in this section must be repeated for each tap@@ ing &amp; CD ; repeated .
since we use a CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from the data fet@@ ched by fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; collect data manually instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet .
try not the &amp; CD ; find this example . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this hasn &apos;t happened yet , the &amp; CD now has to be pushed into the drive defined in the main window .
after a brief moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , check the FAQ and answers section for help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all songs are already completed and the name of the artist and album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you haven &apos;t selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but retrieve the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments separately , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after successfully retri@@ eving the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD @-@ editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for comment field .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see Help for the enco@@ der to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the tap@@ ered CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are found under Rock .
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear when you downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list .
note that there &apos;s a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are so marked will be read . a simple click on the line will turn off the selection of the piece . make sure all the pieces are selected , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time .
if the selection process is selected by clicking on the selection button , then this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
click on the Ri@@ der button to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message will show you if you are trying to work with a enco@@ der you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece &apos;s reading .
job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : job 4 is the coding of piece 1 in MP3 format . this takes out reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that appears to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . for low @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear .
now the last title is read while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order appears in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the top left part of the window .
for successful use of audio @-@ Creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you will need the enco@@ der of your choice .
most distri@@ butions , however , already include pre @-@ compiled packages , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de package . if you read this , you probably already did it ...
this section is aimed at people who compile from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls up many different programs has many options . it is best to read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different index cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e how it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the unusually short menu ?
what is it about ? anyone who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; it is intended to do so . at least only after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this proposal .
strange , if you managed to fetch the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also has some properties that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used each time .
session support . when you &amp; k@@ de finish ; when playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will start automatically as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in more than one piece they will be added to a collection and then played sequ@@ enti@@ ally . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth with the controller .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the speed display and thus change the playback speed . to restore the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar , like pressing a button pause or selecting the menu entry break in the menu , interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; play .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text own@@ ing , others use lyrics own@@ ing and some other both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can choose which events to be displayed and even better : the equ@@ est@@ rian style is automatically determined which uses a song so that you don &apos;t have to manually set the edit menu . however , if you select the Automati@@ cally Text option in the settings menu , the kar@@ aoke lyrics will be automatically selected .
if you want to set an e @-@ cognitive type , select text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summ@@ ari@@ ze . these are played in series . in this section , you will find how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu Collection below the item Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and specify the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Cop@@ y and then specify the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired one in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection will not be saved . consider this if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button Add . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . then , this collection will then be added to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu of the menu Collection menu , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke lyrics .
to skip a song , select the Next song button , next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to boun@@ ce back a song , select the Previous piece , the previous one from the menu item , or press the arrow arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general MIDI . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you do not need a MIDI @-@ map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ us cards , FM equipment and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file which stores all the required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . but the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text id ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; A more Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I will in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compliant .
in this section , you specify how the patches of General MIDI can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 tools .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to set all sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the M number . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun@@ shot . to do this , add the following to the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is the term &quot; drum patch &quot; of the patch , where each sound is a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as is their presence . therefore you have to write 128 entries .
you can define multiple key maps for each channel and instrument . you just have to use different names in the first line .
key maps are used primarily to make notes on the percussion channel . take a look at the provided Key@@ words .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channels , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the keyword will naturally be defined in the file name . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored which will attempt to change the patch on that channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful , for example , to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value n , this is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard , which is a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a note higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two notes up to a oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you will find this in the menu under Settings , item MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole row of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see what sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed a tool , the button will no longer light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views ( up to now ) to display the played sounds . in the View menu , select Settings under the point channel view : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find e.g. a song too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you get a similar sound quality .
this can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s homepage )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add any files separately .
OK , so support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , enable Automati@@ cally Add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have opened one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI @-@ Fol@@ der and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or tack@@ ed ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) , I just have to switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection , turn off Automati@@ cally Add to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the Automati@@ cally Add to the collection and open A.@@ Ther@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Má@@ laga . at the moment I &apos;m studying for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ mo@@ is@@ .@@ es
they make me really happy if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will en@@ umer@@ ate ( if you want this ) . but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me since I might have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time and doesn &apos;t get money from anyone . I would like to stress that I only keep programming because / when I receive feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Magn@@ us pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error message or even a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course also thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net , giving us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ mo@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can watch the development , search for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to sites with additional kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music , of course .
if problems arise , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help please check the site of The K@@ DE web site on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called do@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only appear when information is returned .
it is possible to save preferred connections from the book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played on each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an extra hierarchy level . when you click an item , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback will begin with the cli@@ cked record .
the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . just click on a name of a category , select it from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , select the same with playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected , without matching the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ tain@@ able option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during start @-@ up doesn &apos;t need to be short , it will automatically end by opening another source . however , this would be disturbing at the end @-@ animation , so the user can end the application a second time .

there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream can be set from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer visible .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c , just like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
for the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; to play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player must be specified as service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
the kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . the designed process is called kn@@ pp@@ layer . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so that always a given back@@ end for a particular mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should return all o@@ gg files :
&amp; S@@ MB ; can be played by TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . for this purpose , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog appears in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there you should recognize ports from which one is selected . the code to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also only supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux enhancement must be supported in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally they use different names for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ resource , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ en.@@ if enabled , they start playing the playlist .
are there any hints on how to make my CD@@ ROM drive more quiet when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be executed as root after connecting the device . it is essential to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU have to be checked for performance every time ?
note : the answer is out@@ dated . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . under Unix @-@ like systems , it is likely to rever@@ t to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; -@@ project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the ki@@ le ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the ki@@ le ; website should be made .
if you have any questions about comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le , or if you wish to add extensions , please refer to the ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; features in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; also offers &amp; ki@@ le ; the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management .
to find out more about posters ; and to experience its capabilities , the manual to Kate should be used . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a La@@ ie ( lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less challenging but more realistic explanation is that it comes from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
in order to be able to master properly , good books include H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Docum@@ ent Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and needs to be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick entry assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a useful function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some options for creating the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
document classes : this allows the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , slides &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
encoding : this is used to set the character encoding . modern systems are increasingly using the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as default . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be selected ( for correct processing of the lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users do not need to worry about this . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; ki@@ le ; if you see more elaborate areas of a green text on the screen , it is likely that any mathematical environment has not been closed .
with automatic completion of environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for the input of the text ) and the corresponding line to make the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be ki@@ cked in the menu ... La@@ Te@@ X commands can be de@@ activated .
all documents are usually group@@ ed into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( apart is the highest and sub @-@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files , recovery search can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; e V ice I n@@ dependence File &#93; &#93; was created , &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the usual output art of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the back @-@ up search , the elements of the DVI file are connected to the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI file was cli@@ cked , the corresponding section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the default text is the exact opposite of it . as soon as you cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code , the corresponding place in DVI ; -@@ viewer is j@@ umped .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work with others is simplified .@@ tex files are simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project project settings .
fast construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is displayed automatically ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is on the right hand side , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after fast construction .
when looking at the edit tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for the quick integration of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the quick integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the Other range is for items such as keywords , notes or references . the options available are :
description : with this command , a name for a section , an image or other element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified designation ( select a selection field possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ r@@ e is used for determining the font size . it can specify the font sizes for the main text , the guides , etc . the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses under the \ \ document@@ class command contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font size . if the font size is not set at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above source code example is entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the simplest way to do this is to use the Menu Buil@@ der or button Fast Construction .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le ; it automatically exec@@ utes the storage .
if the compilation of the document fails , you should search for errors in the logging process . if you use Fast Construction , you should automatically start logging . if this is not the case , the logging process should also be considered .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then allow to change the font size within the environment .
the changes are supervised only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many options to increase read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , bold prints , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics pressure and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be represented with \ \ emp@@ h { Word } ital@@ ics .
\ \ Per@@ cent@@ age : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
after the background to write the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; description language has been presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le is now followed .
as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be made . for this , at least one quote , a few places in the bold and ital@@ ics pressure and a poem should come to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to an &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed ( in the viewer ) using File Print ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the transformation of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has been created , the conversion into changed other formats by means of buttons in the tool@@ bar can begin .
the pre @-@ select search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do this , only modern under Settings box must be set up ... tools can be selected .
in order to select the pre @-@ select search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on pre @-@ select search . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; the viewer takes place then .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Docum@@ ent of &amp; ki@@ le ; open and jump to the appropriate line .
if there is no error in using the quick assembly of the &amp; DVI ; if an error is present , it will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file describes the source code in the source code . in the editor you can see the errors of the La@@ Te@@ X error and the first La@@ Te@@ X error for spr@@ inging between the errors . in order to look at the faulty line , you have to click on the error in logging and &amp; ki@@ le ; jumps to the wrong line .
once cli@@ cked on the button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be written from scratch or the wizard is used to quickly create a new document . more information on this can be found in the section .
u@@ fi@@ ger users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file created .
when creating a new document from a file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings ... Pre@@ ferences are set .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by input into document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have to be completed :
when creating a new document , one &apos;s own template can then be selected rather than the standard ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . if a simple way to create a template will be searched for one on the internet and the steps described below will be searched .
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and heb@@ re@@ w from many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to find out more about posters and its options , the manual to Kate should be used . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be inv@@ oked by the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be used in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as its syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ big@@ skip is only selected by \ \ par .
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the Editor window .
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse and highlight various types of source codes . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color .
many assistants can also gain additional jumping tok@@ ens . this is a special type of book@@ mark inside the text . the menu items Edit boun@@ ce marks or the corresponding key rings enable the jump to the next or last jump mark . this is also highlighted by this jumping brand , so that it is automatically retri@@ eved at the first input of a character .
the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; although &amp; kate ; already excellent options are added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; &amp; lat@@ ex ; works always many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection . under Edit Cho@@ ices are the following commands for selecting the text :
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only explo@@ itative thing in &amp; ki@@ le , is that the ab@@ sc@@ esses are separated by two empty lines .
select the word from the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also displays &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a back stroke ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to create a part of the document , it is possible to select this first and remove it by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers the key root C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands for a faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ o@@ ving are the following commands to delete the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; for this reason &amp; ki@@ le offers ; for more commands in editing environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command j@@ umped to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to fl@@ atter the environment .
this command jumps to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to connect the surrounding area .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the \ \ begin { environment } instruction , jumps to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can be lost quickly . this command bu@@ ys the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted ambient structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups defined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that match those from the Edit environment .
this command j@@ umped to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly clip .
this command jumps to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly close bracket .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or behind the cur@@ ly clip of a &amp; tex ; group # , the other end of the group is j@@ umped ( or vice versa ) .
with the input of many ne@@ sted welded group cl@@ amps quickly the transition can be lost . this command bu@@ ys the most recently opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple reference marks are used as examples . for the appropriate implementation it is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the character is used for two simple reference marks . also for the end of the application the character is used . &amp; ki@@ le ; knows this case and add two additional leading characters for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic entry of the double entry badge can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
there can also be a number of other languages ( e.g. german or French ) , so that German or French suits can be used . there are also many other languages available .
when holding Shift ; En@@ ter key for &amp; ki@@ le ; an intelligent line revers@@ al . if the current position is located within a lists area ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; ki@@ le ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a table environment , complete &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjacent line break .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X will be added .
some users want to arrange columns in tables environments and thereby arrange all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; try to achieve this . while pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the underlying line .
although &amp; kate ; already offers good source code retri@@ eval , it was added in &amp; ki@@ le ; for special orders ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three different modes are built . all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings Ki@@ le ... Com@@ pre@@ h@@ ensive .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically adds the command \ \ end { environment } following an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously enlar@@ ges the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions will be removed naturally by selecting a command . alternatively , you can also enter the jump marks , so that an easy jump to these positions can be possible by editing the jump marks N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ st jumping brand and then the desired parameters can be added .
settings can be set up ; set up ... ki@@ le ; En@@ able settings can be made to these lists . you can select different host lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as wi@@ re@@ akers of the general language use .
the command mode is not necessary for re @-@ en@@ act@@ ment of environments . there are always a few letters to begin with \ \ begin and the call of the completion mode will result in a large list with environmental commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing the environments .
the command to open the environment is automatically filed and it appears \ \ begin . after that , the ambient completion can be continued in the simplest manner and will be terminated by pressing the input button .
once this is accomplished , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; recognize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is filed with it .
under Settings box , set up ... ki@@ le ; En@@ able settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of completion of the completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of distra@@ ctions that are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le For@@ ms can be set up . for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the character L is entered and the word completion mode is introduced over the menu Edi@@ ting Fir@@ ing or C@@ tr@@ l + Alt Space , the character L is replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large @-@ scale wi@@ pers are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many readers are written in a document more than once . this provides &amp; ki@@ le ; the complete termination for all those already written .
this mode can be set up in the menu box ... Ki@@ le For@@ ms can be shut down . here , the threshold value for the display of the full @-@ length can also be set .
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the local home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( cooling ) , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex .
the graphic design dialog designs the graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics to the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered .
PS files are not as popular as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to be able to understand the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all building tools are group@@ wise in the creation comp@@ iling , creating and creating views .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by pressing alt ; 2 . then , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the standard viewer by Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file and viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick Building instruction , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project will be asked about the project &quot; Neues Projekt . &quot; the following information is retri@@ eved for the project :
when setting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; ki@@ le ; allows the exec@@ uting of the EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be administr@@ ated by scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can still change in other versions of &amp; ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a rather sophisticated system in which basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are shipped with many documents . included are a documentation for the packages contained and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the search for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
because of the quantity of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k that contains a database with all the documents supplied and for a graphical surface .
all documents are sub@@ divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or tags .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space button opens the viewer to the document .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ led and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; cha@@ ste ; &amp; ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , which &amp; ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; can be executed with installed OS @-@ X .
many thanks to those who strive for the progress of the &amp; ki@@ le ; project and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools that we all can use under observ@@ ance of the GNU / GNU / License .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command @-@ line interface , you can create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig will be read . through many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for day signatures , the same signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day ; for each day , use different signatures , as with the random signatures , you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you an lt ; empty signatures ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . if you have entered your signature , save them with C@@ tr@@ l ; S File Save or click the Disk icon Save .
you can create as many signatures as you want . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use email private or professional , there are always enough signatures .

version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
anyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows me pro@@ c and how superior it is . let &apos;s lift it a bit , we give it a graphical surface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if the inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the wa@@ xed working folder , let the current working folder be checked . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted each time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as I said before , everyone who worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical surface for it .
if the newly opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , your file is er@@ ron@@ eous . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already checked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the file in the current file and select the file to be checked by means of a different file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is , then click the Well @-@ formed option .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; DT@@ D ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme as well as for the Relax@@ NG check is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is already selected , simply select the current file . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed by means of the other file file selection .
specify the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . thus , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait until someone builds the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; more about it below .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start the Edit menu with the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each and GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location use &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project involves several people in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can select from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking the team member out of the list and clicking the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information on notes .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : an event for information can be created to the team leader when something specific happens . see also for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens within the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that enters a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see how such leaders are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to enter notes is simple . either the note entry from the editor context menu can be chosen or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword will be entered in a comment area followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with nick@@ name the inserted nick@@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project leader After the area and sub @-@ project lad@@ ders , the corresponding area or sub @-@ project names should be given as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ in@@ sensitive , but spaces for par@@ enth@@ eses and names are invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using Set@@ anta settings ... This dialog comprises some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags , including car completion , can be changed . entries are :
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically added tags . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically added attributes . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if checked , tags for which the closing tag is optional will be inserted immediately after &amp; gt ;
non @-@ optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags , except for the simple tags .
automatically update the starting and ending day : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accent@@ ed characters into the appropriate encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ s for det@@ ecting various types of files . using the Standard button , the default settings can be restored .
standard code encoding : the coding of newly created or otherwise as file opening files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is fired from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is then fired from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies regularly , so that in case of a power failure or crash next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
set the default window settings to the default at the next start is useful if the user interface is confused by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and / or depending on the views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameters .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more inquiries .
the location to change the behavior of V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the illustration of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action resolved by clicking on the structure tree .
in the field of structure tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the tree update frequency while editing , and how deep with a change in the structure tree will be automatically opened . empty k@@ not are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each one can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ part applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin , if it is not in a default such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information will be passed to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
loading a component in the &quot; Read Only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in den@@ ies the loading . only read @-@ on @-@ parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the inserted information is correct . selecting allows to save the entry , even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it shall be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ designed . support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as is the support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only a plugin is available , support for using &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin , the specific settings can be changed .
when a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view that lists all holding points , with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view showing the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the de@@ bu@@ gger &apos;s supported functions , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
this action is used to connect to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in the normal case it is not necessary to pay attention to it .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to request a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ u@@ gger output view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started before a de@@ bug request is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution goes on . if it happens before a de@@ bug has been specified , the execution starts as soon as a requirement is provided .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , without entering the features or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include files .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next as if there was not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale and this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many more works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to your needs and how to help you become better .
document type Editor packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to provide support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS . they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . their simplicity and flexibility make &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS , . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag file and the tool@@ bar . tag folders are handy , symbolic tags of picture buttons ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details for converting .
this document describes how to create tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the property dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; self . tool@@ bars enable quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without the risk of a writer .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag files carry the name of the description language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags but contains nothing else than just element type .
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the Type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes inside this tag can be added to each other day . ( only family 1 )
this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of attribute . in addition , it contains additional tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . will be used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a editing and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container day group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( for example one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements which may occur within the defined tag . this element is a only element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements ending a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause leg break@@ age , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is above in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ windows to start and select Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check takes place only when the tag@@ XML files are loaded in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the following is an example of a family 1 tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file is supposed to be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 tag XML file . in this file , one &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag@@ XML file is supposed to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D processing DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = deployment 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... to be created . click New action to enter the same dialog :
the short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the user defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with one , the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the details settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . even the Schnell@@ start dialog or the various see in ... A@@ ctions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in your path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we replace the current document URL . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this is used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document , or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can accept input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the input field input can be determined what to send to the default input . possibilities are :
selected Text : the selected portion of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable normally only makes sense with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; errors can be specified , which should be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the output drop output :
if there are many tags in mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the check @-@ up .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to specify actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the tool bar .
complete everything and , if the day has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; Edit Tag &quot; when available so that you can input when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Diagra@@ ms other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green will usually be regarded as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this icon will insert ; start ; -@@ Day in the current document .
after creating the symbol it still has to be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and select the desired action . beside the text field there is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , so there are some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared in several groups for a better overview by some separ@@ ators . open the tool@@ bar setting dialog via Settings tool bar . make sure the tool@@ bar you want is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by hal@@ ving all symbols to make sure everything works .
backup in the correct folder . after New XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder .
perhaps the most notable increase of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . check whether someone has already done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we &apos;ll leave the first part to you , we will handle the second part here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for example HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = func@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the shaft depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is directly refer@@ enced to a file ( and consequ@@ enti@@ ally displayed at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but pay attention &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to form the context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script should display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context @-@ related context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else . at various points there is an email menu item , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree .
resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus users can download them . contributions are reviewed and only available if our team considers them to be correct and useful for publication . to make a new contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the dialog New resource the input fields must be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menu , upload tool bar tool@@ bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the Author of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , the creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in tag@@ XML format . there is a simpler way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the transformation can be started from the DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . then , the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type Defini@@ tions line : the string that should appear in the Doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand them and to gain full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ arise themselves with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars , actions and patterns in a global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS , pattern up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ g@@ licht the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Editor window , the tree views , the index cards with information and the tool@@ bars . please consult , and for more information on these areas .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries , such as closing , del@@ eting , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , skip to a book@@ mark or exec@@ uting CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Editor area leads to a further context menu concerning the edited document contents , such as basic processing steps ( cutting / past@@ ing / past@@ ing ) , editing the tags on the mouse , using the word below the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor or opening the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a simple tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into their document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now , you can enter the data for this just added day . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and strip them . in the presentation with card holders are available for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be done with the context menu displayed .
another way of using &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; all options are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . global templates are always available , local templates only for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of re@@ integration in Global , Local and Project works here too . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands opens with respect to navigation and refresh the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the entry system geared to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . it can be pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder Do@@ c to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be app@@ ended , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window that can be reached using the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in the Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command . the chocolate bar of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is sensible if you want to customize the location of the / qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and do not execute here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in P@@ AT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while attempting to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a nearby idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a stand@@ alone , exten@@ dable mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely most powerful web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ! so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of Why Develop@@ ing what already someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; framework is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers to expand how they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can be increased almost any task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is not associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the more detailed documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ ront Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . look into the section about templates . should they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts the special characters to &amp; HTML from the cli@@ p@@ board when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board , so that they are displayed correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ Description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day .
this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages exist !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
switch off and switch the problem area porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , main window . the problem re@@ porter will be activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set Book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with the entries Pre@@ dictions or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu , group@@ ed by the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows to copy video files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de , and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , see the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . it just creates the name . actions need to be specified by setting actions ... Add tool bars are saved through tool bar tool@@ bars , or you will be asked when you want to save the tool@@ bar .
removes a tool bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; that made you or anyone else and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . own description format .
loading / refreshing the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be fresh@@ ened , without renew@@ ing the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission is not present in the global K@@ DE folder , the load will fail .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML , ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / promotions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag preferences dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent integration means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . inser@@ ting through tool bar is denied if this day is contrary to the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed below the above menu items . clicking on it activ@@ ates it . clicking on an activated plug @-@ in will be disabled .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available pre@@ dation schemes depends on the current version .
sel@@ ects the type of line @-@ end identification . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by using the external application ti@@ dy .
inst@@ ant@@ aneous switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch can sometimes need time or cause un@@ attractive graphics . recommended is the index card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode corresponding to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window to be activated .
sh@@ uts off the status bar on the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
al@@ ig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters , you will find details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add them and change the sequences .
this should generate a help corresponding to the mouse poin@@ ter environment , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be completed from top to bottom , since the whole directory structure is completed automatically for the rest of the project , e.g. after filling out the project name . all of these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here &apos;s the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field blank , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which tool@@ bars are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and modify . if you have server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started anew from scratch , do not hook up .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to good man@@ ure .
this displays a list of files in the root folder . you can select the files you want by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . in the menu with Project Properties menu , these settings can be uploaded in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profile or changed using the Shift ; F@@ 7 key short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which can be re @-@ read for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional options to the above , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set using the Options button .
high load profiles ( see in ) can be set up in the sub@@ window profiles , as well as showing a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by pointing one &apos;s own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration , event actions can be switched on and these actions can be added , changed or deleted . event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced at the moment .
to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project is displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project management view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and opened with ... in the context menu , which can be viewed with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows to remove the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is displayed to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten at the end of the program . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the more in@@ secure password on the disk save option does not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many upload profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the Project or Project tool@@ bar in the Project or Project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to their own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are best displayed using the tool@@ bar menu . usage and addition differ . adding tool bar is treated below in the Add @-@ On tool@@ bar section .
the tool@@ bar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the tool@@ bar ) , in which New action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , it can remove other actions like tool bar , ren@@ ame tool bar or adjust tool bar , which actions on these or other tool bars should be displayed .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries are added to the action and actions are displayed that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set settings actions ..
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . templates are basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . provided templates have conditions for their deployment . please read the conditions mentioned at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary Tem@@ plates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents are ne@@ sted in appropriate sub@@ folders . you will create a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in an appropriate way to be efficient .
this type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area will always be included in the documents again and again . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl .
as the name says , these templates serve whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
design a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As a template save as local template ...
once this is done , note that ( even if it is saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree below project templates .
select text in your document and click File As a template save option as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn using drag and drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag and drop or insert via the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
in the file tree or in the project files tree view , you can click on a folder on the right and create a site template , enter and secure a name for the template . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can set head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically integrate with &amp; PHP ; create , insert or link files . in addition , you can keep a few things in mind when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window Tem@@ plates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates .
to specify the behavior of a folder , click the template with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three types described previously ; files , text or templates .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set in such a way , it would disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in the case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text tree . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows pre@@ defined or provided text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows to equi@@ p a whole presentation by copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a full list of commands for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one location to another using the context menu .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be accessed via the View menu . the first mode sub@@ stitutes the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second , spl@@ its the editor window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to source code editor if necessary , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol shows the default of PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit it , the source code editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
second mode works just like the first one except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously . pressing F@@ 9 activ@@ ates this mode , this mode is already active , offset the active cur@@ sor from one window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is configur@@ able via Settings Qu@@ anta . by selecting V@@ PL ; -@@ View you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in general the recommendation is : a small span for fast computers and a large margin for slow .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , tools document properties can be selected . this allows you to edit invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; editor . this allows you to modify the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
using the cur@@ sor is possible , as in a word processor , by moving arrows . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves stran@@ gely . the selection functions as usual .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way through the tool@@ bars , such as in the source code editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor day , surrounded with text is inserted , any other surrounding anchor day must be removed .
some tool@@ bars such as the table wizard or the Listen @-@ Wi@@ zard are disabled . later , they will work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the analysis of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet can be tra@@ cked .
um &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; compile it successfully , except the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .

in this command , it is checked for a partial or entire agreement with a default named my@@ ME or a given model name . &amp; eg ; template is consistent with any my@@ ME that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified my@@ QNA@@ P@@ cloud will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was a lot of conflicts during merging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , lots of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently of each other in a piece of code and make changes . the merge editor under the differences window allows you to resolve conflicts and at the same time displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen shot shows &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and reflect the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you need to check code frequently , you will like this feature .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more trouble if no one changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other one is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means both files differ .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can ease your typing by writing only the file name of the first file . for example :
K@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 @-@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder folder folder Fol@@ ner@@ 3 folder 3 folder folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 @-@ o target folder
the Open dialog permits manual typing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the Open dialog reveals your selection and displays it again next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences is done with two files .
via the Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merging or merging of folders is introduced . if a file is selected for A , however , a folder will be used for B and C , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other two folders .
if merging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can do it later when saving .
the Set@@ ting button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting the merge / merging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board to the active comparison window . the comparison begins immediately . in the opening dialog , you do not have to select files , you can close the dialog with the break button .
you can also drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar features . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you &apos;d need to create two corresponding files , upload them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret drag and drop text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data may be lost .
the Info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame , and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( note that window C is optional . ) If the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest a while above the line .
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these default settings can be changed via the settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , you can see in the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . this is good to see in the next section .
when differences have been found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + for example , white signs are only relevant in strings and comments , for pre @-@ processor and in a few , rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no rows . if the line breaks are enabled , the line is dotted with rows of broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the message output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have edited the result . usually , it contains already text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference at the same time must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also create a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to automatic merging or manually editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a selection that you might copy and paste elsewhere .
the Text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if selecting sources ignor@@ es the numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white signs .
navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll bars and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side up , start , end , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you are also used by other programs .
in the default window , you can also use the other keys to edit . with the In@@ sert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is inser@@ tion mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture in@@ ward ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the selection to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l paste ) . if this is enabled , you will automatically copy the option to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying is not applicable . however , be careful with this option because you could accidentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart re@@ traction + new@@ line \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line ends of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when you exit and will be restored at the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ing@@ s- &gt; K@@ Diff@@ icul@@ t ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides type@@ faces with variable width , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , you will see differences in itali@@ c script . if the selected script does not support this presentation , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered ast@@ ert . on these systems , the pres@@ et button automatically displays an un@@ corrected color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted at the pressing of the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
pressing En@@ ter or Return , the ind@@ enting of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . then the manual copying to the cli@@ p@@ board is then om@@ itted .
you can select which type of line you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual choice on the operating system used .
while comparing files try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical rows in the source files . only during this first step can be ignored white signs . in this step , white signs are ignored . even when merging , white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others save only one new@@ line character &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the carriage return character is made visible , but like a white character . during merging , this option must be disabled . in default , this is down@@ lighted .
in default , this option is down@@ lighted . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
in default , this option is down@@ lighted . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in Automati@@ cally advanced mode , this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will be displayed before continuing to jump to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
this is useful when white signs are less important in many files . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use the options Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Auto option also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments .
these options are discussed in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge . check for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
modify the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
the code for coding appears a short notice of what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are handled and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding to use for saving .
if you define pre@@ processor commands , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to set the output of pre@@ processor commands .
turn off this to supp@@ ress the emphasis of changes in white characters in the text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available when comparing three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded overall column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you &apos;d prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just send out the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes consider the differences and then decide ab@@ rup@@ tly to merge the files . merging the current file in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that suits your needs . you can use this function , for example , to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . the output of the command is only used for line balancing . you can write your own pre@@ processor that suits your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to allow the user to learn more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program this yourself . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l suff@@ ice .
use this Pre @-@ Processing command for new@@ lines to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( \ \ \ 1 / \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a special expression that cap@@ tures all characters in one line . the \ \ 1 in the sub@@ stitution string refers to the found text in the first block . the \ \ U converts the text found in capital letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all of them follow the same pattern $ keyword generating text $ \ \ $ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like those regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ icul@@ . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line balancing . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi @-@ deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the conditions from each other . example :
instead , you can use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l some details are different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre @-@ processor are retained for viewing and merging . the other operations only alter the data that the new@@ line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can see .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre @-@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programm@@ ers need to work in a folder for many files . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simul@@ ated changes without actually performing them ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you only need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as base . if no target folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start , do not merge . to start merging , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
when you read the folder , you will be informed about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files that have been compared to that time will be listed .
when scanning the folder is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed in a tree here . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can fold up a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - or by double @-@ clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories can be opened and all sub @-@ directories can be folded up with which you can open or open all folders .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if merging is started , you will be informed about any problems of this type .
as seen in the picture above , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries varies .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . at folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , is red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , del@@ eting the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , del@@ eting the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copying from A ( or if A does not exist , del@@ eting the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option synchron@@ ize directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; select the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; copied directly after merging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and the option to select a new file instead of merge ( unsure ) is enabled , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and displays the newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , merging the folders cannot be started .
during merging , one file is processed after the other . you Status column displays Fer@@ tig if the merge operation was successful , and correspon@@ dingly different messages if something unexpected appeared . if merging is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if the file comparison method is selected Full analysis in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will show more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the matching actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging .
please note : if you don &apos;t have a destination folder , then in the Three Fol@@ der merge mode , C is used as the target , while the two @-@ folder merge operation B is chosen as the target and when synchron@@ izing , A and / or B will be used as the target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped by the specific entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / resume in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current entry , select the action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if there are still invalid merge actions due to conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options Per@@ forming , Sim@@ ulate and C@@ anc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
if you &apos;re done with a file , select / resume directory merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t already saved , a corresponding dialog will appear . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if you click on an error , a message and detailed status information will appear . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . if you continue merging ( F@@ 7 key ) , you will have the option to choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you continue merging .
if some entries have been combined individually , these entries ( in the current session ) will not appear again . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( setup menu - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that are also ignored by CVS . many self @-@ created files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be set to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a preceding dot indicates a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
for links to files : if the option is turned off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
in case of links to folders : if the option is turned off , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is switched on , the links will be treated as regular folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not run on possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder containing a link to yourself would lead to an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is switched off in default .
performs a full analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
the files are considered identical if they are equal to size . this may be useful , for example , when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
enable synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the merge suggestions are selected to match both folders . also , the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of merging the newer file will be proposed as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , as it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file is already existing with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal merge of individual files , not only the merging of entire folders . this option is enabled by default .
normally the folder merge view is visible while merging single files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can turn off the option directory &amp; text window and switch between the directory &amp; text window between the two views .
you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . to do this , use the Current File merge function from the merge menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be returned and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : new
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open that are on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder will be displayed . then , a file is always assumed as a link destination . ( ft@@ p : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification date differ from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( this is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is the viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P will always start the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P , press the right mouse button above the viewer viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then de@@ generates &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view to - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . note that this does not work if none of the original files exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part , it only supports compar@@ isons between two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now known as the compact ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff @-@ tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way or will go it like that .
you compiled the program from sources and probably did not tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default install configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diffusion 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line is considered not identical .
the editor is aware of any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking into the source code and selecting the A / B / C button . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file , and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
the effort for this has so far been too large . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c lin@@ ts ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !

cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Um@@ br@@ alt Rem@@ ove ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift + insert ) inserts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current selection .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you will need to re @-@ read the Update folder after changes to these options . )
this also means that identical files are not copied to the target folder when merging . if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the inscription A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed again when clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . different characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , exit them or shift them . this works both inside a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved . motion is possible both inside a desktop and on other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only displays the two entries P@@ ager . if , however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .

if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work areas .
if this field is enabled , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops will be displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
tick this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is inter@@ sec@@ ted along with name , the names will be provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . working surface .
if this field is selected , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the box .

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen shot . you can increase with &amp; K@@ mag ; a part of the screen as if you read in the newspaper a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impairment . this documentation should be a complete manual for using &amp; K@@ mag ;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance machines .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag ; a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the enlarged section of the screen . in the following , this window is referred to as a magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged section of the screen and is referred to as a selection window below .
in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the range around the mouse poin@@ ter such as a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively you can &amp; K@@ mag ; to do so , set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( select window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse cur@@ sor being displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter setting . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard code ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ sor .
in the selection window , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also works with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you press the Shift key , press the &amp; M@@ b , you can move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of features . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts or stops the updating of the ad . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and reduction &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen zoom . you can magni@@ fy &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to view the stere@@ otype in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual han@@ dicapped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor har@@ rows a while at the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury @-@ Syndrome ) and which every mouse @-@ click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse cur@@ sor har@@ rows a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , it is also possible to have pain caused by the use of your computer . if you suffer from pain associated with using your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not occurred yet .
to clarify this again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic auxiliary agents , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you stop the movement short .
if the smart move is enabled , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button em@@ ulated . move the mouse , wait until the end of the move , before letting the mouse button run . in this way , you can pull the pull at pressed mouse button . the smart move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click on a mouse click .
if intelligent delay is switched on , the shooting range is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button is waiting , before releasing the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse is done in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if this function is enabled , a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these moves are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can drag &amp; drop to shor@@ ten the response time . to do so , open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and click here the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer that lets you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be started ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings are reset to the status after Apply .
the best thing is to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you are then used to the automatic mouse click , you can later add the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de , if necessary , with sounds .
first , you should be aware of which areas a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not represent a link will not lead to unwanted reactions .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . how this happens is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . dirt and dirt can be easily scra@@ pped with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using intelligent delay in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens if you &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor in another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to where you want it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of the mouse , if you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke . safe zones for the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the smart move is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to mark text , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board , or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart shift if you just start using k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will always play when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the shooting time begins when intelligent delay . later , you can use the smart move without the audi@@ ble click of the mouse .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X window must be installed ; this should be the case on most systems already .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and they are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor har@@ rows . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and who are causing pain to an@@ aesthetic .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait for a certain time to start a Zi@@ p process before releasing the mouse button . this way you can also drag and drop the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows dum@@ b users to speak their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that are to be discussed again .
on the first page of the Wi@@ zard ( left screen shot ) enter the command , which is later used for the speech output of text . for more details , see the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text@@ book book . from the text passages you can often choose used text passages without having to type it . text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can compare the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word completion .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a sequ@@ ential memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have selected k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . any spoken sentence will be app@@ ended to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sentences that are to be re@@ written .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the side of the word completion as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the language edition , enter the command to call the Language Generator . in the selection field below the input field , specify the character encoding with the text to be passed on to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your voice generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with possible kt@@ ts@@ d as a voice service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text on to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page are ignored . the dict@@ on language service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a passage of text , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text@@ book text@@ book or in the bar for text passages .
the selected text passage will be directly discussed with the selection of In the input field . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will be entered only in the input field .
with the second selection field closing the editing window for text passages you can determine whether the text@@ book book should be saved automatically when closing the edit window .
when you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book script will not be saved . choose Before saving , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book book should be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ Box page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box if this list contains more than one dictionary .
with buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then select the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can combine the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted .
with this option , you can create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . since &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , you can create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main section of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new place or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
the selected text will be cut and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the flow storage will be used .
the selected text will be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the flow storage will be used .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ iry memory .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool@@ bar is arranged above the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is selected , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window displaying information about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the bar is arranged above the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another location .
you probably did not enter the command for the voice output correctly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for the voice output on the language voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
the Festival is a speech voice system at the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the Festival free of charge and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ e.@@ The voice output is then possible with one of the following command sequences :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of Free@@ T@@ TS application . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to break the text into phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax be@@ ck@@ ons the last character of the text , so that an additional character needs to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option to send data as standard input needs to be switched on .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is an &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the setting of the voice generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use the possibility to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog , when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to successfully use , you need a language generator ( and natural &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( plus memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak can have text displayed by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can always re@@ charge .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not include a voice syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the computer .
more detailed user documentation can be found at help : / k@@ mouth ( either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ons ; - the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows each application to read text on the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .

before you can use cookies , you need to install and correct the program speech tool .
at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card spokes@@ man will be displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card card is displayed in general .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female voices , or those that differ in volume or speed . a combination of language , syn@@ thesizer , voice , sex , volume and speed is designated as a speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer sp@@ ans for the same printer .
if you click on the tab Spe@@ aker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card spokes@@ man will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start frac@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the speakers preferred above appear in the list . the top speaker is used for speech output if an application does not provide a speaker .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
choose a type of voice , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card card Spe@@ aker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ons ; almost use it . go back to the map general and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ D ) to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ons ; use to make text orders and manage . see .
if you have at least one speaker installed , you can start the language release system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the tab General to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ am system . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card will display orders and you can make text orders and read it . see . remove the mark , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and disable the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is completed , it runs &amp; kt@@ ons ; next , provided the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) enabled .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr pop@@ s up automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the reading is finished .
with buttons in this row , you can start , cancel , pause and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages .
the index card orders are displayed only when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the tab General and tick the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . check first whether &amp; kt@@ ons ; then select the text to be read and select Tools in the main menu .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text on a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML , pre @-@ tension@@ ing lines and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . then check the text that should be read and select the Text to read in the main menu . then the voice output should begin .
this also works when &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fying you of events set out by you . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ons .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up a message where your nick@@ name occurs in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ons , you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ noti@@ fy , appears a menu item noti@@ fications in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Not@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which belongs to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ons ; is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases as presum@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ons ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ons ; filter is not required .
in filters , text is processed before being sent to the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation in order to replace wrong spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to b@@ ypass certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the way filters work , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ons ; distinguishes four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be continued .
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the output of the warning .
message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; have a long text read on a website , you can chat with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . each job you initiate from the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are meant for the output of longer texts , which do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four orders are processed in queu@@ es except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ons ; just one such reading will stop and termin@@ ate this issue .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders , as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there may be more types of filters .
strings replaced parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be provided either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ons ; is delivered with pre @-@ defined strings of strings that allow the creation of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Converter use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ons ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ml .
with Spe@@ aker selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program sent to &amp; kt@@ ons ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have a female voice on the card spokes@@ man , you can read text of K@@ DE messages about it . read more about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it will continue to pass the text on to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it will be processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom . processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters established . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and will not be used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the below introduc@@ tory di@@ alogs are displayed .
for setting up string replacement filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column En@@ try . the list is processed in the order shown from above down@@ wards .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list of a file , the entries from the file will be app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you hold the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key pressed at the click of the mouse .
here a value is entered , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copy .
the string replacement filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the string offset filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no manual to write regular expressions . however , if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it in the di@@ alogs adding or editing as help to merge these expressions .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former transl@@ ates &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the auxiliary program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the P@@ AT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the Spe@@ aker selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker that is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain features . for example , you can set that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ons ; a text sent to the filter , it searches for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program provides , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ons ; the speaker is selected using the Spe@@ aker selection filter to over@@ ride the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call this one click on the button to get help in entering .
to achieve faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you are looking for . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to match the desired requirements . click on the right button to view the dialog box sel@@ ector dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your spokes@@ man settings , or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker selection filter will only apply to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with which programm@@ ers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so &amp; kt@@ ons ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section provides a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d on the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands , enter
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . first start kt@@ mu@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have created the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Converter filters , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read .
due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters seem to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or just cow@@ ries are spent . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a character cass@@ ette replacement filter .

the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ons have their own license , which you can find in the associated documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ons , download it . &amp; kt@@ ons ; find the source code of k@@ de@@ fil@@ e.@@ ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
includes many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project website ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ il@@ i , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ z@@ an .
K@@ T@@ TS also works with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be launched on the command line in a console .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . also check the website of kt@@ ons ; , for information not included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table modul @-@ architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand and expand for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the development team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile and comp@@ ress , you need a recent development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including the package k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ons ; from the source code archive for you , or have downloaded the currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use cookies , check first if the speech syn@@ thesizer works properly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ons ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ons ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed in such a way that the device of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can return , repeat , pause or cancel stat@@ ute or paragraph style .
for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ons you choose , you will see in it .
if you click on Add to add a speaker to the list , and to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card card spokes@@ man setup will be displayed . as an example , the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . for details on the modules , see below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter the festival .
select the text encoding for text that is passed to festival . in voices , the &amp; kt@@ ons ; known , this setting is made automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
these slide controls allow you to adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controls and display this grey , the voice selected by you will not let these settings be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of the K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forgot to click Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section is visible after the start , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD read a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited proposition . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card board speaker .
with the buttons in this row , you can proceed or rec@@ ede in the order , which is selected in the list below . ( but not every job consists of several sentences ) .
with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other index cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be sc@@ aled down to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the audio card audio . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News will not be displayed . more information on the telecommunications types of &amp; kt@@ ons ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ons ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or del@@ ts ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the subscri@@ ber speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about twice the normal talk speed . to allow these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out which device is working with you . in doubt , select Standard .
on this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message . &amp; kt@@ ons ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you &amp; eg ; just let a long text read on a website , you can chat with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who is entering the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ons ; the audio output to the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the spending of Screen Re@@ aders , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ons ; C@@ noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the cart@@ on card will appear aler@@ ts .
select this check box to activate pre @-@ reading &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ons ; do not read noti@@ fications .
when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications where a sound is played is by &amp; kt@@ ons ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sends if someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are by &amp; kt@@ ons ; ignored .
use this selection field to specify what &amp; kt@@ ons should do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter the properties of the desired speaker here . standard chooses the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the card board speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific application of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . as a last option , the action will be carried out under standard ( all other events ) .

the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . besides , brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ml is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ons ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , as this is the standard voice , the festival used in the issue of SS@@ ml .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 . % , SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . this allows &amp; kt@@ ons to start ; faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set has to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the entire text order .
with the first start of &amp; kt@@ ons , a set @-@ limit detection filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add other set @-@ limits recognition filters , but beginners will get dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to do this is to check the selection of speakers by trying out . switch on the selection of speakers and select text to read . check the selection of the speakers , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course , you have to have more than one speaker installed , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ons ; then you can start reading faster , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time ,
you can pause or cancel text orders on the index card , even if the speech syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up if you start frac@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing .
syntax Fil@@ ters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and insert a tab character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set limit@@ er filter retains the pun@@ ctu@@ ation .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ bps ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal set of tab@@ s , you can re @-@ paste it by loading the contained file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c .
on the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection menu , you can over@@ ride the Spe@@ aker settings for the application .
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card spokes@@ man ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
use of the most suitable speaker with all the features of an established speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ons ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ons ; the speaker that is most likely to match the originally set properties .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the speaker you want . if this property does not matter , don &apos;t enter anything .
select this check box if the property is to have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set multiple marks here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as the primary property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may wish to provide the language attribute is when you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than that of the working environment .
to use all properties in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default speaker drop button and then use on a speaker similar to the following .
in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( no order number is required to enter 0 ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr clicks immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get back tracking .

the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work when I play music with another application at the same time . if I receive a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ons ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system there is a problem that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , see the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have added an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I have installed it and can use it in the festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / sec@@ ts@@ d / Vo@@ engra@@ int / Vo@@ engra@@ int / Vo@@ engra@@ int / Vo@@ IP . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developer .
in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modul@@ s such as festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed on the card board for speakers . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ons ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ml ; ) or , if you &apos;re very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ by @-@ SS@@ ml converter @-@ filter , and set up the speech speed .
I don &apos;t create websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ons ; reads the websites with a male voice .

I have added an own character cass@@ ette replacement filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ons ; no more substitute for it or go back . on the tab orders is displayed , the order is only one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
you are not allowed to filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clam@@ ation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for the set limit detection .

festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . for many voices you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ons .
you will need to install at least one language . help will be found in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .

festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the coding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes over le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete voice output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . festival produces these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e.@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German texts di@@ phone . more information can be found here .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; allowing network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware may not install . physical devices and their drivers must have already been installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf to display the device at all and enable setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed when installing &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the network settings option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; when starting the module network settings , this attempt to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list that best meets the distribution and release date . by marking the setting non @-@ re @-@ questions the definition can be made permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically pres@@ et .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously all options gray are shown , which means the settings can only be considered , changing is not possible . in system management mode , you can enter system management mode at the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the whole functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the Network Interface tab is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed from the Network Inter@@ faces tab :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface ... in the Device Dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the button Exten@@ ded Settings shows the dialog with further options .
automatic mode retri@@ eves the TCP / IP settings from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server automatically sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setup is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field IP address .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can determine if the address you want is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching off an switched @-@ off network device will be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching off an activated network device will be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
defines the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located has to be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host is requ@@ esting ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will invo@@ ke this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
entries can be added , removed or changed . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be added to priority by selecting an entry or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons additions or down@@ gra@@ ding .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group machine to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group machine to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display dialog Edit .
the list of know@@ ingly known hosts describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list of know@@ ingly known hosts contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still existing version of IP is to replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known machine has several Ali@@ as names , press the button Add multiple times and enter the other alias name .
select an entry of a particular known machine from the list and select Edit .... The dialog friend machine will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network Settings module are not effective immediately in the system . to enable the changes , the following command must be set in a console .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . simply download the rpm package and install in a &amp; con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution can be used .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de does not suff@@ ice , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and / or compile the following commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic networking technology , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf will be discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely used . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future .
one of the most important information is the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; Work@@ place the network administrator is the contact point of a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be arbitr@@ arily chosen !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a dedicated area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are usually used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for specific things , eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP for@@ warding .
the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address is assigned 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this section are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is another content than specified in case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is dropped by the scripts in Su@@ SE config . a different stand as expected can therefore occur .

alternatively , right @-@ click on the variable and select En@@ able . make sure the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly .
if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or modified , you need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . to do so , select File Save .
alternatively you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables are then activated only then .
it appears the standard tab ; Print dialog . if you choose to fold out , you will see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog .
prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change user schedules .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which additionally offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to fast , selective un@@ packing . the second aim was to answer a question that asked my wife : how much longer does it take if you secure ?
before a strap can be used , it must be incorporated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; re@@ strain the band and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t recognize the band on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
detects &amp; k@@ dat ; looking for the right index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything goes smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the band has been included . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ apping the entry for the band .
before ej@@ ecting the strap , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen through a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been resolved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; if your tape drive assumes that a tape can be format@@ ted before use . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capac@@ itance , &amp; k@@ dat ; continue with the format of the tape . all data on the tape are lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically included and ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and choose File ...
once the backup is started , the dialog box opens up for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings .
if you have confirmed the settings , the Backup dialog appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click in any of the archives and select the menu item Check ....
once the check@@ out process is started , the dialog box appears for verification . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for verification .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears to be reviewed . this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can re@@ connect , the files to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the Rest@@ ore menu .
once the restore process is started , the dialog box appears for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for restoration .
once you have confirmed the settings for the restore , the dialog appears to restore . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file by means of the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can recre@@ ate the index on two types of tape :
this creates a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a safety profile :
the current working folder where the backup is to take place . the list of files to be secured is updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files on the same file system are backed up , such as the folder . folders located on other file systems can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is considered tar @-@ independent from the others .
perform incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the belt device .
if this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command mt load to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be done .
if the option is turned on , &amp; k@@ dat is trying to lock the ej@@ ection of the tape drive . it may not work on all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , the tape will be dis@@ connected ; automatically dis@@ car@@ ded the tape . do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , communicate the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the name is the whole name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are tar archives , which can be managed directly with GNU / tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a hed@@ ging tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a system log ; the program is intended for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files . moreover , the system allows for quick access , for example , to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence , try to provide some advanced features , using the protocol files of certain programs to be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log , functions are provided with which the individual protocol rows of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will open . if you do not see them , and it opens instead of a small message window , you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most probably not with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in folder / var / log , for normal users normally do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or according to input strings . the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically , so that only log lines will appear next to the filter . in the default setting , a log line will only be displayed when the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
of course , you can also select another entry at this point . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the column process , and in addition in the filter bar , select the name of a process , and you will show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol rows that were sent and / or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol rows . protocol rows of the level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color than protocol rows of the level indication . the colored display of protocol rows can be disabled alignment dialog .
if you want to view only a particular process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command , such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar .
in addition , you can enable the option to skip to new lines in the main window &apos;s context menu to view all the new protocol rows .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org . you will find more current information on the Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; find the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
system V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for controlling the program start when running the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole bunch of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to boot when you run the system or when switching to another Run@@ time . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most of the systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a serial port in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places and starts the first one it finds .
the default running level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default set is 3 . if you want to change this , then you can change / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful if you have mess@@ ed up the in@@ it@@ tab changes .
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does in@@ it start and stop system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would hold the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if one contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the start argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; have a server running level that only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; I could also have a user @-@ run level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : just drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six Run@@ ning levels to start ( or stop it ) at this level .
you can also move scripts between the run@@ level or alter the position within a level by removing it somewhere else . the entry is removed from its original Run@@ ning ( or its position ) . this will only happen if you extract an entry from the available system services .
note : entries are moved when you move them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new Run@@ time , you must explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the contex@@ tual menu and insert in the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the number numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ time 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous .
to move an entry into another run@@ time , move it to the cli@@ p@@ board by cutting it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sort number or name of an entry manually , press the input key to change the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . Pre@@ ferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to pres@@ ets will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the entry button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply exit with no news if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ time varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar , or save the entry in the File menu .
the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . for editing , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog User and group properties .
some flash@@ cards will only be displayed if you have extended system settings . only if you have limited space limitations ( quota ) for users will create a map card on which you can make individual settings . more flash@@ cards will appear if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Unix .
the register card password management appears , if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if space limitation ( quota ) is activated and initi@@ alized for at least one fil@@ esystem space limitation ( recognizable by the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ as group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with limited space limitations in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the field file system with limited space limitation
the map groups inform groups about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click on the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group will work an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and modify the boot password , change the time to boot of the standard operating system , add , remove , modify operating systems , remove , change , and more .
