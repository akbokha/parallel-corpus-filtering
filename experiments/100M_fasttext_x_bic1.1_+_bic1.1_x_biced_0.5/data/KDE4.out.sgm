<seg id="1">The module website can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras website. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated into the whole & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. Babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, translations do not make any important decisions, without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by yourself on the Babelfish page, where you can insert translating texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains several modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some extra features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about using & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings enhancements.... Open the box card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard installation modules from the kde package; addons. please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which contains & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on the & konqueror; click Extras crashes. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes, if present.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Calculator module (also called folder filters) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras address filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select DOM tree Extras... and thus open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, for example: documentelement, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportionately to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView, the size reflects the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. in this way, large files can be easily recognized even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy. consequently, & FSView may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap account a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over View Colour Mode, can either be depth for the easy detection of the nesting depth or the image of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, or whether the area is to be used by subordinate rectangles (which is, therefore, display errors caused by constraints on the mark of the Treemap). moreover, you can set the relative position of the caption in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemap in Treemap, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always adhered to. frames are drawn to represent the nesting of entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this context, it is always advantageous for the labeling and for the avoidance of space losses due to frame always advantageous the areas to arise that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View Anders on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets developed for KCachegrind application.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Photo Gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras Photo Gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the module image gallery, a dialog opens, with which you can set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to customize the title of the image gallery page in a text box.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Picture per line option has a slider and a knob to adjust the number of miniatures of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">Display the filename of the image to see if the file names under the thumbnails are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the check box file size of the image, you specify whether the file size is shown below the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">Show whether the size of the images is displayed under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog box, specify where the gallery will be saved and which sub-folders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Save in HTML file, specify where the HTML page should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the subfolder check box, you can set the sub-folder with a slider or a swivel panel, until which level the sub-folders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">To copy the original images to the gallery, please specify whether the original images will be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">With the comment file check box, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box selve color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; -Settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation area can be found in the & konqueror; menu under the window navigation pane or with the F9 key shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror navigation area; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser identifier adds a menu entry in & konqueror; in addition to which you can change browser and operating system identifiers for individual domains. this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser identifier of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change the browser identifier into one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the code in MSIE for pages that reject access with browsers on the base of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser identifier to call up with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser identifier is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the scope of information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; -module check your & CSS, style sheets and & HTML; -documents in accordance with the recommendations of W3C and other standards.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digirs; albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digiplug; includes quick image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, review and correct them. editing capabilities can easily be expanded with KDE Image plug-in interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digicame; easy to use, dozens of professional capabilities are available. it works completely in the 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by libraw, DNG-export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or lens to search for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also & digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvements.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digitized; try to report problems or suggestions as easily as possible. wherever you are in the program, the Help Menu includes one entry troubles or wishes... This will open a dialog with an underlined link. if you use this link, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. all required information is already entered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& edited; is a project supported by a community. that means that the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, we would like to encourage you to ask the user mailing list of & digirs. however, you may have questions here to other users of & edited. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicode; visit homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about & edited;</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get involved is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for signing up in the developer mailing list of & edited;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you & digicame; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your machine. here, the data file is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digirs; will additionally use as an old library.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images, as base folders. & edited; viewing each subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed. during browsing the folder you get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& edited; searches recursively the library path in its entire depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless it is in hidden folders. this can be done by extrbs & digirs; you can do this by inserting a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as base folders, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenCharts have no photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can start & digiplug; set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw File Support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, & digitize; maybe also deal with it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a specific camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set it up and work with raw files is described in the Roh DecoderSettings and Roh workflow sections.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digirs; albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera is then used as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digicame; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, redistributable digital camera software that supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digicam; supports these cameras and guides the transmission of pictures with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found on this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so the thumbnails of digicam can be reliably read. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, thumbnails may not be possible or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the nicest things at & digicame; is how easily its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plug-in Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digirs;, KDE album, showimg and gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier & digitized; by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in & digicame; perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page strips with & LMB; or change to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and dropping images works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the almine tree, above the horizontal separation distance or into another application window. the only restriction is that an image cannot be placed in keywords, date list or searching.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view. thus, the filter functions on the filename only if it is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed can you configure in the dialog of the Allocation Settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My alenlistealth; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos that are managed by & digirs are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they have been created on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the almine properties or after the date the album was created first. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. choose album Import images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the destination album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection from you is used to sort your photos when you select After collection from the toolbar or create albums After collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date sorting.</seg>
<seg id="91">Buttons Oldest, average, New Year: these set the date to one of the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. this will first attempt to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & edited, the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the album. it will help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; As album preview, select. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digitized; supports input of key words for individual photos in the area My keyword list on the left bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window gives you the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all the images in this album are displayed in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait short while the preview images are generated. you can avoid this by using the Extras All thumbnail images in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be displayed below the previewed preview. what information is this, you can change the settings dialog; select the albums page and adjust the thumbnail area to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails feature help windows that appear. if you let the mouse pointer rest a moment over a picture, the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such an help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are everything about & digicame; albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this. you can reach all the functions that were done by & digirs; you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 image editing... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing... in the editing pane; image editing you will find a guide how to edit your photos. with image editing you can view and modify your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digiticks; the functionality you need is not provided. you can open a photo in another program by using the context menu with right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of the file. to do this, and how to customize it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing, other image editing programs may cause problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image. this means that information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& edited; set two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click on the preview and select turning. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. keep in mind that you maintain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo & deleted; delete, it will be moved to the trash bin of & kde; F8 Image Delete or Delete If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Delete.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My date slime; organize your photos based on data. & digirs; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month are shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo may be found by selecting this keyword or searching again.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all the photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. this allows you to logically organize your keywords. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword list, so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and allocated keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the keywords are re-imported in the loss of the database as soon as & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords using the right mouse button either on & quot; My keyword, or click on an existing keyword and then choose New Keyword. if you add a new keyword after you clicked on an existing keyword, this becomes the subsonance of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and deleting. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and put it down there. then appears a menu that gives you the option to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in a tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-click it and select keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in tree & quot; My keyword; change.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, click the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To take advantage of the functionality with keywords, you must first have your photos with keywords. this can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos that you want to provide with a keyword, you can drag them to the appropriate keyword in the tree & quot; My stitch. alternatively, you can click the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can give a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have added a photo with keywords, this will appear under the thumbnail preview in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and remove from the Tags menu Remove from the menu. the menu only shows the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a time-dependent adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved by this histogram. in order to select a time frame, you only need to click on the bottom rectangle of the selection frame that specifies the time unit. this will display all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. it will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">If you click here, the filter will be deleted and all the images will be displayed again. if the search has not found, then the lamp turns red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple seeker box as described above. however, you can save this search here as live search, which always filter what you entered as a search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are happy with your selection, press OK and search will be performed. the results will be displayed in My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after searching, you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select search, the form to enter the search appears again with the previously entered search information. if you select to edit as advanced search, the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search. here, you will find more rules for searching.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select search in the context menu Search.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced Search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & edited; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Almine database. all rules will be added to this list with search group / search group deleted or deleted. each option can be combined with others via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least...</seg>
<seg id="132">& edited; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows you to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop any image to find a similar one. by means of a threshold, the result range can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left side bar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digiplug; find the matching pictures. also here a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can drag in or zoom out or hold it while you move. move Ctrl; left mouse button to pull a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this is then added for a later use of the list below. it works like a Live GeoFolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digiplug; provides a light table in a separate window where you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L To add the luminaire from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and opened its window. if you are back in & deleted; main window, you can quickly open the illuminated table with L extras.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview strip you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow will show you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you select a preview from the toolbar and perform a zoo or move operations on one of the pictures, these are also executed in the other image. you can thus compare the same area of the two pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly fade out of a picture series. if you use pairing mode from the toolbar, then both first images are automatically loaded into the fields to compare. use the left mouse button at any preview to display it in the right pane. this simplifies it through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, normal deletion operations also work directly from the light table, such as F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right-hand side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to combine visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the lower end of each area you will find a built-in swivelling function, which you can see on the crossed arrows. in order to change the visible area of the image, you must click it and hold the & LMB; in the mode preview, both images will then show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom functions as well as in other views. just use the zoom knob under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images when you are in the mode preview.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion statement? digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos leads through a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images, find, protect, protect, convert, group, back, convert, group, backup, review, search, archive, optimize, maintain and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; digital inventory management takes up, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, confuses and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. according to your definition, metadata is data that provides information about or documentation of other data that is administered by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you don't need to find a particular photo without inventory management. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then use it not & digitized;. the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files ensures very fast searching and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you need to decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive, etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">Vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. the remaining photos will be organized on the basis of your date. if you do enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separating file types makes batch processing easier. separate new ones from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to be stored in the metadata entry page & Format. this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? in addition, & edited a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are, of course, the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should assign keyword words, captions and an evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense, since you can focus on the best photos during further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's talk with keywords, keywords as you frequently call other programs, or continue categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digiticks; automatically build the tree for you or insert the pictures to the right place. changing the hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can easily be done by pulling a subtree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digirs; updated as the subtrees are tracked.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very rough representation, as each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone know your photos just, you want to share it with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. far away is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it more closely, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normans 60 years after landing. wow! you begin to dream, to have associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. so the caption has completely changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who view your photos, the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer to help him over the motive that you moved has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect, if it has the strength only to work with an inscription for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as labeling. you can even set it for a selection of pictures at the same time. KDE even provides you a spell checker.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to go to another city without a navigation system? wasn't it Earth a boring planet in Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now drives with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of exploiting geolocation are already countless and will become deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels via pictures with geographical indications. & digitize; can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps Viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a copyright and describes the practice of using copyrights in order to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also applicable in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digicame; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, for example, to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization may be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: associated with the author. this field contains the work description of the photographer. examples of this can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here, which you provide the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or modify this image embedded in the picture. for private individuals this is very important for most of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digiplug; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate failure, plate failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these types of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, it is about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss has.</seg>
<seg id="180">Of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that requires a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable. so it's about choosing the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors even if you have just been written. that's why they use a controlling sum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control environments. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called IsoBuster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and therefore almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recorder on high-quality media in a non-propriety format. then read the media with a description, date & author and then store on a clean, dark dry and protected spot. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject: disk error study</seg>
<seg id="187">The failure rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of defect, SMART can not detect these errors. some of the errors identified by SMART adversely indicate the imminent failure.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files, but these losses can usually be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make a lot of electric shocks, it looks different on devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboard and other defects. therefore protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against spikes is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the power heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug connector. however, remember that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems. some manufacturers produce over-voltage contactors which also have a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the cable modems coaxial cable and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. some models even allow them to continue working until the current is running again. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the included software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety with the costs of avoiding these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be you up to & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can integrate it as a drive on & Linux, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer allowing you to store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, compared to the hard drives at home, they are very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. your free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">The web solutions are very safe from the point of view of data backup. transmission errors are automatically corrected thanks to the TCP protocol and with large companies there is a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transmissions are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. nobody seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of errors a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate failures on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux, and Windows.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms that ZFS uses and is also available for Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss for notebook and 46% for desktop systems. for notebooks, the share of thefts is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage than for example theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has not been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: false, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: untrue, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden operation is higher and an undefined status will be avoided. however, if a file was not fully stored before the problem appeared, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. this means that while the technology continues to develop, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel cameras. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deteriorates. a sensor size of 6 Megapixel and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so do not blame anyone else for data loss. therefore, secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like reinstalling your operating system, changing sheets or changing the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups every day on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash will hit you if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane crashes: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desaster prophylaxis always means non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common cause of data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two times: that of the complete backup and the last differential protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made. this backup comes closest to a versioning system, with the exception that it is only sampled and not running continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-driven FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only the difference of files that have been really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come for the backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, stored in the image file, IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, reinvent images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., using the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable images survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate as time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way to make a certain vigilance.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition. * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command whether your new disk was detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdc # resource is / dev / sdc # resource is / dev / sdc and dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBO; # functions with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollars; resize2fs / dev / sdc # modify the size of call if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day does not exist any software that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task becomes easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that is slowly disappearing from the market, so you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG is designed as an open source standard which should replace GIF. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color allocation in heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely distributed as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (delate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, it is a problem that this format was adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative file format is a royalty-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG is developed on the basis of the need to unify the camera formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already providing DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource block & quot; technology of the nineties. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mix of XML and RDF. file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive the original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP works as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, there may be problems connecting the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, the raw format is obsolete. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard links and enlightening efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images on the camera system are, you can use it as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing you can use external programs. if you edit the images again & digitize, then you should add the metadata again. these may be cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. then export them to web galleries, code into mpeg, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & edited; in the section Adding a photo to an album, you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your disc database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera & digicam; to use, connect it to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. for some cameras it can take a while. when the connection is established, a feral indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before downloading the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the page accomplishments and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metals Metadata displays the internal metadata such as Exif, Manufacturer's notice, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as the Metadata page strip from the main window of & edited; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is by clicking the button download and then download the selection of all. this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in & edited;. when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures were safely downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos you can select the desired selection methods from & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then Download Selected. download the Selected button as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New Download is available. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you use the buttons All download or download selected albums, a dialog appears in which you can select the destination album in which the photos are placed. the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums section. select the destination album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the destination album, press OK, & & edited; upload the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can all delete them at once by deleting the Clear All button. if you only want to delete some, you must first select them and then delete selected deletion.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera. you should therefore carefully check if the photos were successfully removed from the camera; so you should carefully check if you want to delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera, you should do so using the camera's menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often use not particularly meaningful names for the photos. the file names are normally reused after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can result in duplicate filenames in case you download photos from different shooting series into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image has been taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder per day will be created automatically.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options While the transfer opens three more options that are executed before the photos are saved on the disk. the first two concern the data about the author in the standard auto identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the latest option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the default format, you can use the prefix photo-% Y-%%%% H:% M:% S. for further adjustments, you should read the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the option camera file name, you have the option of modifying the file names in lowercase, or in uppercase letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, edited & digitised; used for a photo, is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and used automatically when you open the next time the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitized; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and when your camera does not provide this information, & digicame; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the extension button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date the photo was taken, & edited; this to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are uploaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data section, you can check which information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case, & edited; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you must switch on this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button. then select uploading. the file selection dialog box appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, & digitir asks; you, where the images are to be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear. select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in length and width graph and which can be displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it may be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digicam; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 serves many GPS data fields, such as direction, artic and card references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a reworking of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geo classification (manual) and last about manually setting up known locations.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit. but there are a few working with GPS receivers. either as a map module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save these data in the gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the module for geo-classification.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same on & Linux;: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the accid coordinates created by maps.google e.g..</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all the navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& edited; try to give as much control over its workflows as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & edited. to access these settings, you must select the settings dialog. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on Embedded Preview or Edit Image Processing. you specify the default behavior of & digicame; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields, if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface. also in case of a database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC data fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for the author: this field should contain the professional description of the photographer. this can be designations such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author's field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for suppliers: use this field to indicate which the photo offers. this does not have to be the author if this is for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here because this is the picture other & quot;. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">IPTC's actions save the data to the corresponding IPTC rims. this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the & edited version; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & edited; imported without losing.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image descriptions in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the pictures. this way, your captions can also be read by other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse-cursor rests in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digitized; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify what file types & digirs have been attempted, you can add and remove file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by clicking the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The & quot; & quot; can be set to the default values on this page. however, each time you open the LED, these settings are turned on when possible. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar when you use the image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the image. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the more detailed explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality, because PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF file option, you can switch the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality as the Deflate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">You can save lossless JPEG 2000 files lossless. even if you select the lossy setup, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digirs; image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. at the moment it is developing very quickly to a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default is that all green pixels are the same. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitively to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd rows, this difference creates a grid pattern in output. this option draws the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 mesh pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the peak lights, so the parts of your images that are burned-in due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights as a continuous white. the setting colors trigger some unusual results, since it shows the pointed lights in various Rosatönen. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible since blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & redw; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option reconstructing, you will get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should / should be individually adjusted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1. however, this can be done later in the image options of the & edited; image processing. in order to keep the time for the demo icing down small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo-icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that comes from the color-filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of color pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA Interpolation or Farming Construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digicame; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks like AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenic Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it creates color artifacts on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for a color softening correction, as it is done during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there are also LCMS and & edited; information such as colour information from one color space to translate into the other, so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image editing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Set here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you save all your profiles. & edited; examine this folder during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the opportunity & quot; standard source; for your profiles to be deposited. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which does not include any color mapping or gammacorrection. currently, dcraw gamma does not correct conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you need to carry out the color mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof profile you can emulate on how your image would be given back from one device. this is very useful before printing image as your printer can have a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore highly satisfied. this could you manually correct instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for. unfortunately, not on the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a series of image viewers and image processing. by deploying this interface, & digicame; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use and those are then deleted by & digirs; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) on KIPI modules can be obtained from the KIPI project at http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper control adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off, which is displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left side a list of all the currently supported cameras. on the right-hand side there is a button automatic detection which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in image display mode. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you have selected a USB- or FireWire-mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digicome; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window's menu. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog box for moving images in the trash bin, you can display & edit the deletion of & edited; when deleting a photo in an album. in the deletion of a photo and deleting an album, you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly & digitised; applied if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without any questions. otherwise you need to save the changes using the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display & edit & digitize the welcome screen; under certain circumstances, this will speed up & digitize the startup process;.</seg>
<seg id="334">When you are looking for new or deleted albums / photos, you can search for new or deleted albums / photos. this will extend the start time of & digirs; if something has been deleted from the base folder, & edited; you will be asked if it will delete them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be found in & edited; these settings can be used to match the main window to your taste. you can select these settings from the toolbar under Setting Design. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digicame; create, find more information on this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& edited; includes quick image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and for correction and enhancement. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on previewing an image or by the context menu of previewing and selecting the item Ad / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digirs; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, please refer to section Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnifying factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and including the toolbar for quick access to the most commonly required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions of image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or save the button Save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore menu or Restore the button Restore the image processing Restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by editing back and recovering by selecting Edit Players from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z to undo and mark Ctrl; Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press a moment longer via the undo or restore button in the toolbar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter and zooming in the photo in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel, or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: automatically select the magnifying factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, the toolbar will also be displayed. if you do not want this, you can call it in the & edited entry dialog; you can view it from the & edited; main window. see the section for setting up image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the File menu and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole sentences. you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Express Assistant. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & edit; main window has a sidebar on the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation file, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab, letting the sidebar appear or disappear into the edge again.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view, you can enter or insert lettering with unlimited size. note the remark below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into the EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are deformed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling panel in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, use either the Apply button or simply change to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Next to the application button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write metadata into the files. however, this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The Evaluation section indicates a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sortations. it can be applied either with a single mouseclick on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate several images at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the Urgency IPTC field. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword is shown by a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this & edited; session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. this allows you to quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords with a picture series. if you have typed different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate box-fields in the tree. all keywords of an image are keyword stored in the keyword keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, If you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The side bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, - date, keyword and search results. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and drop keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and place it on the selection. as a result, a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off under settings Various.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and realize that it would have to be one or it, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an extended search on all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly took it to & edited; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resemble those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results that he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide you with links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, then you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are by email or the web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and thus worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callibrate my monitor if I have decided to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you must coallocate your monitor since sRGB suggests that your; onitor is based on sRGB, then you have to use either your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve one image in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, balance, automatic contrast and contrast extend from the Correctanking automatic corrections menu to automatically make the best of your colors. you'll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the brightness values over the whole picture, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Similarly, almost every brightness range has the same number of pixels. this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic matching: this method maximizes the ink range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and bright boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast enlarge: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a rerealing of all values in between. this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digicame; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly limited as over a colour gamut with 8-bit per color is used. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be customized in size. on the left hand side, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the destination picture has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right, a histogram shows that dynamically changes once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your total is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow alignment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the preview to use the chosen color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the Preferences list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The exposure indicator will increase the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is exposed. you will get the combined result in white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set can save you in a text file and load it back later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default setting reset all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original. if you save it, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the widespread JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is available only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles can be consulted from the color management chapter.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find color correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously so that you can use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same error and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation that you will find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tool colour effects provide you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that arose when using a partially developed pressure a short flash light and then completing the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second light. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity is controlled by the Solarisation. at approximately 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further upliftment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it the film of choice for nature photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the strength of the neon light. in large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos. you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all of your adjustment can be viewed in preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the opposite problem: a too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple signal strength / contrast / gamma, the tool barrel correction is located to improve the exposure. even if the dialogue to this tool works very complicated, you only need the section of the slider for the application explained here.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, histogram, active channel or selection range. under the graph, three slides are clicked into that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controller and make sure that the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and the thumbnail of the image can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically using the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box, you can set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear display is often the most useful. in pictures the large ranges of a constant color, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lower for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color tweets can be used in preview of the original image to automatically adjust the entries of the shadows, middle and light tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two regulators that can be used to change the output values interactively as in the input value. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a faded image as background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values in the file system can be saved and recharged later. to do this, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">When you use this mode and the three color pipette, the input file is automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the entries of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it's no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example for adjusting entries to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be shown. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right hand side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this box allows the channel to be specified and modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images that have been recorded with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most sensible. for images with large ranges of a constant color, the linear mode creates a broad beam. in this case, logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, e.g. the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">When you move this marker on the area you want to change, a matching line will appear on the curve depicting the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, means and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result displayed. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it's no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photograph that was corrected in the Luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & edited channel mixer; image editing is a tool for improving the color channels or changing the color shades of the image.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel blender is another highly developed tool for mixing the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel blender of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left area of the window shows you a preview.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are below: controls for Red, Green and Building allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the image will retain the general brightness even if you also activate the Monochrome option as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black-and-white conversions of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space. color brewing consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise patterns appear different in each channel. if this is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color brewing first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Load buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it's no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was re-adjusted. the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of its ability to abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, because color images can easily be converted to the computer.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lunar scenes at the time of the day. similarly, like the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and enhances contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of the absence of a pressure and the re-development in a squamatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & edit; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to one image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, stitch of an old master, a pop kind portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to be seen. the parameter of relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With & edited; adding tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of an observer in the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired type of frame for your image. the image is rounded off with a colored line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), rounded off with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a fiery effect and decorative, adding a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the printing of the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before use.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into a picture at any place. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text execution, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need them. the bigger the image, the bigger the character set must be. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any settings you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK". once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With & edited; apply tool stencil to put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The template template apply in image editing can be used to place stencil over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you must use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to decrease the file size of the template. if you want to add your templates to & digikam, just send an email in english to the & digikam; mailing list digirs-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button root folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder was set for the stencils, a tree view appears which reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder. the selection of a folder automatically updates the preview strip of the stencils.</seg>
<seg id="474">Beneath the thumbnail are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinks: this button shrinks the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces granular images especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. in fact it sharpens a bit, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is perhaps the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitalized images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalisation process needs to be summarized with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn causes sharp edges to be printed together. SLR cameras typically require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, a camera is often used for internal sharpening. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a field of sharpness while reading the image. if you disable this, you get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a picture with the sharpening tool. you can invoke the desired results using the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful with this as the results do not work very naturally: sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most suitable technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you will reach it via the menu entry Correct. you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too tight. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it to sharpen. use the tool to mark the soft sign with the menu entry Correct softeners and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or amount amplify the effect. if you make the blurred mask too strong, noise and the impression of grats will produce close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. they should therefore best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applying difference amount. thus one can define a minimum difference thereby for an edge of the filters applied. in this way areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). unsharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicame; tool refocussed refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected design filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurr mask. refocus usually reaches better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by focusing colors refocusing in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular fold is much better than the gauze's fold. the gauze's fold has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixies removed far from the original source pixel. in most cases the FIR Viennese Inverse of the Gauss's folding is influenced even very strongly from the distant pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. the filter can accept values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0, the image quality is very poor. a useful value is 0.03.</seg>
<seg id="502">Indulgence's sharpness: this is the radius for the gauze's sharpness. use this parameter when your blur is' gauss'. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a non-zero value, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can generate good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauge's sharpness. note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all blanks, color and intensity adjustments on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before changing the picture in any other way. the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not visible immediately, which later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, Unsharp masking produces better results than sharpness. this could be caused by the blurred masking a larger neighborhood used than sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the blur. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Linear filter. practically, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of correction in digital pictures, you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob smooths the sharpness of the area that has been obscured in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restauration process. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothness over the picture. whereas larger values mainly smoothen smoothes and details. a value of 0.9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards. note that the detail conservation should always be subordinated to the direction dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 can only be smoothed in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD noise, a high value produces wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary, if very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbish effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-step width da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be selected small. therefore, make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing, and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more the quality you get by selecting this option is only low, but it doubles the runtime. therefore, we recommend it to omit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and drag a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button demolition.</seg>
<seg id="529">The module is applied to a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a strange black artifact in the foreground that caused by a poor film deposit during the trip. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitition; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hairs on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings window can stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters are needed per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller bugs fixed.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the field of sharpness. this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to determine luminance changes. if it is increased, noise peaks are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer get image details and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: check the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamblolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas typically more severely smothered. however, it also smears the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controls the adjustment of the phase damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminous density. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is to its minimum, noise and phase jitter appear at the edges. it can remove smoke spikes and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used for this purpose. all the noise reduction parameters you set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool for softening with the menu entry Correct softeners and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & edited; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration allows you to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that emerge in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture substitution. the texture of texture is performed with another tool, the image error correction, the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Franconkreich and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: JPEG compression is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a loss-hasty compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; arteftsquot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. any type of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Beam.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restored like a photo with uniformalized noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film grain on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures are reduced to an old color photograph that has been scanned with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by the scanner lighting and the photopaper. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & edited; tool Hotmail allows Hotpixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression of hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; light Pixelquot; on a photo with a darkroom subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the darkroom button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and light pixels. these will be highlighted in the preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you capture the dark directly in order to detect new hot or light pixels by CCD malfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark will find the bad pixel. note that the wizard shows the last dark and will automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are lifted out in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durcut: an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a one-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image can be seen below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitising; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially the medium and large photo format, can often not even illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) it can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">There are also disadvantages. many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed in such a way that it is impossible to hold the camera by hand. wide angle lenses should also use an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as there would otherwise be blurring effects caused by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's film and color depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a CenterFilter by applying an equivalent transformation to a raw image made without this filter. the tool vignetting correction applies the transformation with a CenterFilter onto a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators, you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly a luminance of 2.</seg>
<seg id="572">Brightness, contrast and gamma setting: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixel. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of exposure of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digiplug; image editing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">The original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. an image and contrast correction was also carried out with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & edited; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens along the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth degree adjusts the remote corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be eliminated virtually.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the second degree distortion. with negative values, distortion-like distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the fourth degree. this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'corners' parameter has the inverse sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resumes the image size and thereby performs a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightens: this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview displays the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonn- and cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. best perform this correction as the first. if you cut an image anew and then perform a barrel-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent the falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the distortion / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them with the blanking tool in the menu Transformers from image editing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs, such as pictures from front, frame and painting, is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the image have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image can be seen below (1) and the corrected figure below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infra-red film from the GimpGuru.org website, which can be reached under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters for film grain and film sensitivity (ISO). when you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film, the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">The filter color channels are mixed for the reproduction of infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, because the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; Filtration Filtration is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers blend great silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The filming effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back to the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photography, grainy sight specially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, on ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the processed one (2). the used film sensitivity matches ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still lifes are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smooths controls the smoothness or, from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the machining is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide image is 1 and smooths 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitising; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you. these would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the top knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; filter Gravure shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; engraving is a fast tool to re-enter your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, mondaring landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortions. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: splits the image into cells and lets it look as if it is seen through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1, the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Beam.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom infinity: blurring the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from one center. this simulates the blur of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixels to a central point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to resign in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurred the image by horizontal motion of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: photos taken from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blurr: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamor photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness blurr: blurred the image by moving the pixels, thereby simulating the blurring of a moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: find the color pools in the picture and blurts them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Beam.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this gives it natural your images a wet appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyright-protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the visual effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digitize; image editing will keep an area free from rain drops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter Regentropfen the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropfen filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can put it in the right direction by mirroring or turning. the tools for this can be found in the menu Transformers Turning or Transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the Cimg algorithm that is used here makes a good job here.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The size change tool uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixel. if you want to increase a small image with a better quality, then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digicame; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photograph was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary, if very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbish effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each copy can be saved as a text file and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Beam.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo inflating by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard augmentation for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. in order to trim a photo you simply need to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and raising the rectangle. you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo is cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply pulling it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button Encut button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or Save file under the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview section, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as high-format or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After aspect ratio cuts a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">In the dialog box, you can use the Max. ratio button to set the area for cutting to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are shown as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The Preferences Manager settings make it easy to blend in so that you can better compose your images. these help include:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious divides are based on the similarity principle. like the third-part reins, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonic triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division divided into different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden ratio in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where any number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two preceding figures.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more fluid guides when you put together an image. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third-part rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this kind of composition leads the gaze of the beholder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. there should be something that the eye drops into the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this can simply be there without leading the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles are also derived from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the center points of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, gold triangles are not a triangular triangles. diagonal to place on these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use gold triangles to break your frame, you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontally and Vertical Options can be used to mirror the harmonious divides.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the guides can become invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it happens easily that you keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates an image in which things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with the & digitition; image editing and tool free rotation. choose to convert Free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with slide angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the default setting, you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window.</seg>
<seg id="664">To your help, the Free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transformers cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is the Automatically trim function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after the rotation. note however the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. preview is then automatically calculated. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is blurred a little. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformations cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal shear, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module by transforming scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can rotate horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angles will be reset to zero. preview the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview window.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shear, the picture is blurred a bit. for a single shaving this effect is mostly negligible, but two alloys produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing, the picture has blurred triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& edited; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats then depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digirs.</seg>

<seg id="727">& kgraphics viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphics viewer; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; an. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; & & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph in & kate; recreates the graph and in & kgraphviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & kate; Open or open the graph in & kGraphviewer; in a & kate; Component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphics viewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for the representation of graphs. requires in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own sub-window. initially, if you start & kgraphviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar only contains the symbol file and the (empty) list Recently opened files. click on the first icon to view the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or automatically select this position.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special buttons, left and right with pressed and Alt key; - key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>

<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph is to be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kGraphviewer; if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Settings kGraphviewer; set up... use, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a Graphite file outside a running & kvenrevie---instance, & eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraphviewer; instance, or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub-window of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graphene coming to a page will be adjusted to this page. the aspect ratio will be ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph distributed across several pages without headline and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewal load page gives the option of setting the behavior when a file was modified on the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or let the program ask for each time.</seg>

<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directional graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of directional graphs. the algorithm places the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unspecified graphs. it produces representations according to the spring sprite model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm generates a spring-spring model for unspecified graphs. it uses the fruit-man-clean gold heuristics, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The Circo; algorithm directs the nodes in a circular way according to the description of Six und Toller, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command, which is then executed by a shell. the command should specify the graphite file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can give & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms change with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>

Flickr allows you to send photos to people that are important to you. you can show your favorite photos of the world, place your camera's photos online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The exporting module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be guided through the process of generating a token. it is used for your authentication, so it's your ID to Flickr. a browser is started to allow you to log in with Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successfully logging in, the module can send photos to Flickr's website. you will be presented the following page after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have clicked on Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr, which will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the module exports to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. at the moment, the module does not support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options. using this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. clicking on the Ok button starts uploading the photos to Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a comma-separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during upload.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographical localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. the geographical data is stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools for locating images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx-format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization correlator. this interface can combine a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and enter the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. in order to run a possible correlation between time and location, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file contains of course data recorded at the same time at the same locations as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded there is an automatic correlation that indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be performed with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have track data from one place for images, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location is in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can place these limits here and then push the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog box is the coordinates of one call to the next, you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set using the map displayed. select the region in question and enlarge it again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between card mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module image gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages conform to version 4.01. you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The Rider selection allows you to select all the albums that want to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the preview and the text displayed in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIXHTML, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth. of course, this also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnail thumbnail allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not automatically be closed. you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during production. the web browser will automatically be started at the end to preview the preview. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and scouts. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless Module is a tool for changing images without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is that the file size is increasing because no compression of the color information takes place. this is also found in the PNG file.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera Klient currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The CIPI Metadata Editor does not currently have any documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the KIPI mailing list at kde-imaging @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Metadata module import function, you can copy data from one image to another. to do so, select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write in any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please refer to exiv2 to see what formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodiver module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The mpeg encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images that should be packed in the MPEG Diashau. then you can create the module via Tools MPEG Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you select are then listed among image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are happy with your list, you should customize the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value produces sudden, high contrast, very smooth picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG file output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, this is integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can start the creation of the movie with the button code. depending on the speed of your machine you can now go fast or in all tranquillity a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you're back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a suggestion appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages using the button settings on the right.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also automatically be opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve or print with the Gimp module directly.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and run the module. the Raw-Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the button preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBA conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">As soon as you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or later use them elsewhere, you should not choose the JPEG format, because there are only a limited number of operations before image quality is deteriorating. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a memory format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion using the Execution button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use abort.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing in a single image which is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing files automatically. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can make the image smaller or enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportionally (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. for example, you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo ID. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before. more pictures can drag and drop to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will display the images you preselect. you can add more pictures using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview will be shown on the right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop pictures to the list of images to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Removing the images will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After selecting all the images you can open the New message window of your email client using the OK button. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you select are already attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures at once. most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your Email client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify in the input field below the correct path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments to the images are added to a text file and enclosed by the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG file format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format then the original Exifdata will be added to sending images.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically be closed so that you can view the status messages in the search for errors. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Slideshow appears a window with questions about how you want to have your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option file name indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner while the presentation is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a continuous loop. afterwards, you can manually cancel it using Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not the order of the images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the images can be set between the pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test it before presenting your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. by chance, each transition between the images selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar, you can pause and restart the presentation, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not currently have documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module converts the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have noted your pictures and videos with notes, you can browse with & kphotoalbum; by browses, see picture. as you can see by comparing with the image, now are available in each group, thus in people, places and in group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have added your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse with the mouse, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the pictures you see are shown on which both persons can be seen. by this selection method, you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you selected all persons, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the image each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person a thumbnail image, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself. see the picture below.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button located on the right outside of the toolbar. in the context menu you can select which view you want to use for each category. this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must specify which image should be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you must open the Image startup window (described in more detail) and select the category editor in the context menu. in the View window, you can adjust the magnifying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the search entry in the main window, a dialog appears, which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog on the image again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the labeling or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can either be part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use an area of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can search all pictures by certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures on which Jesper, however, are not shown Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the User Manual for & kPhotoAlbum; if you do not like to read handbooks, but rather want to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the website of & kphotoalbum; and watch the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo in case you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry to start the photoalbum; then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kPhotoalbum; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print out this manual, please visit the website of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this strip you can see here:. as the name implies, this strip shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">Each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed items preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image will show you this date in preview) and also the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time indications. if you select an area, only images of this period are displayed in the preview pane. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a log of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kPhotoalbum; introduces two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as a module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version is described, which you can create via the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description containing the HTML file later. on photoalbum; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether you want to create a photoalbum; export file to be created on the overview page. you can find more information on the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, that all pictures are of a party. note that all pictures are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clear, which is why they are not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. that way, those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 will not download any images that have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you have fixed. so you can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings area, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">For all of your HTML files, select a base folder and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and added automatically next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can either select a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be launched. the URL you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them to it. in order for the import function, see, properly works, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described settings have all three based on base folders and URLs. in them, a subfolder will be created, whose name you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you may want to create your pictures with these. however, if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc., you have to start with & kphotoalbum; this work will not do any more.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kPhotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are exported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is just a link to images. the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the images together and that you can share this file as independent. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file scans the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating the .kim file will be searched. this is only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following is the dialog for exporting images, which you can invoke in the Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important feature of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the manual close to the .kim file, you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically close to the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is limiting maximum image size. if you send your friends pictures, you might want to send the pictures not in full size, since the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Export menu... select, will import & kphotoalbum; import the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">First you have to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is in your database people. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and which categories correspond to them in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database. you can see an example of this on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump inside different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) determining the information about your images, about (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. at many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but frequently it also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kPhotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kPhotoalbum; remember the folder in which your pictures are saved and use it automatically again in future starts. if you want to start a different folder tree with pictures, you can start your photoalbum; for example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Settings kphotoalbum menu entry allows you to set up a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the User Manual, the various settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left, you will see six different icons with which you can view settings of previews and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 button and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit already existing groups. for each existing group you can select an inscription and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete groups of members, i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group rather than all groups of a member as explained in the section.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the selection list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kPhotoalbum; splits its modular system with other graphics applications, such as digiplug and gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called through the modules menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by multiple applications together, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphotoalbum; therefore, you should always test new modules first with the demo database before you use them on your own pictures: demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. do not say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications using the KIPI modules are very different, whereby it may be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the downside if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates order for albums so you can use the functions with & kPhotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album that simply fits the current view, so all the pictures that show you the preview of the picture right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, you must also pass a list of albums. this is where you go and photoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be used in the category you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you are using the category people, you will do a photoalbum; so do so, so whether you would have selected people to view it and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the Settings dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start your photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar, you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the entry images showing you an overview with all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; it is possible to add comments to each image. this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture, where the image has been taken. for example, each image can be displayed individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for example on all pictures Jesper is depicted and all pictures taken in Copenhagen were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text field by defining people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of your photoalbum; as you will always use them again and again, if you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people, you can, by moving the names used up, locate and assign persons faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon to sort by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may want to edit all selected images and add notes. in this case, simply click the front and back buttons below the image to the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded several images, e.g. with the same person, it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Several entries at one time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a subgroup. to show you that this is a group, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory. in addition, you can also drag an entry into a category and put it there to make it a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and moving the buttons that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make your own window from a frame by pulling it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to suit your needs, click on the Options... button, which allows you to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely omit a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options... and then hide / hide windows. you will see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the images in the browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images, or of all images if you have not set a filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the image viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the picture preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Delete key or select Delete from the Edit menu. now, the window will appear that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kPhotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; you can also use pictures without having saved them on your hard drive. of course you need to have the pictures stored somewhere, so & kphotoalbum; you can view the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all the required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images from which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard disk. however, the thumbnails are present for the images 5-9. however, the thumbnails are available for the pictures 5-9. however, you can't view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires that you copy files from the folders and copy them back. & kPhotoalbum; if you want to avoid trouble, such as the mess of your pictures, please buy a larger hard disk to store all the pictures on them.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu item you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you would like to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures in such a way that at the end those who wish to make them inaccessible and click the latest view blocks in the Privacy Settings menu. alternatively, you can also control all the images that your little sister may see, and choose the menu item All except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have specified which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, which will hide all the images you have locked. if you want to get the pictures to be displayed again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select Change Password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this image protection is by no means very safe. on the one hand, all the images on the hard disk and on the other, anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar, looking at private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & kPhotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to see them at some point. for this reason, photoalbum has a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in the picture. of course, it shows the picture, but additional all the information you have in the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed. all of these options are available after a right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here, the browser, see the matching entries to this page. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the keys image high and image. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and End. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kPhotoalbum; then download a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus. started and stopped the slide show by the keys Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer to switch from & kphotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can drag in and zooms into the image. you can simply pull a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus button you can zoom out again The Plus button zooms in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot-key, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not shown. with the equal key, the zooms sets so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom-operations that work with videos means that they enter and zoom out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the shooting functions from the context menu, you can turn the picture. this does not work with videos. you can make notes to the current image using the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image. at the moment you can view the pics and open configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark it as good or bad as you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to see images with characters while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter. in the picture you see a picture with which the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have added features to your images, these are available in the browser. you can see this in the browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, simply add all of them at once. this is described in. after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview. if you can view categories in the preview screen, you can add characteristics to the pictures by simply press the letter for the feature after the image was selected. you can see it here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case, you will allow you to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture will not be saved with the image, but in the database. in this way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In you can see a picture on the painted. to switch on the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; switch on the image from the context menu. to exit the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovModeler; you need to control the application of the program & Povray; not fully proficient, but the documentation about & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views yellow is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the subproject of an object already selected, since all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed to enable you to choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With Delete, either from the menu bar under Edit, or from the right-click context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to accept these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply, or discard the changes with abortion.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can view a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as a default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these controls with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the checkpoints disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a viability level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the parent object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the level of visibility chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can adjust it as you like. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below a view, drag the link to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle will then display the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, pull the button on the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the Anfasser in the middle of another view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the flashcards at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to loosen a view from the anchorage, pull the Anfasser on the desktop or click on the small left pointing arrow in the panel bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the connector bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them in any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with view window arrangement... it displays a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can render it. & kpovModeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon In the toolbar icon or select the menu entry View scene rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes as you wish, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you select the render settings icon in the toolbar or select View Render Modi..., the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to use a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the picture, select the check box subsection and enter the image section to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality, you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User Manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moiré pattern or scale effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. in general, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling includes the neighboring pixels. the second method is adaptive; recursive, because each pixel is continuously divided and adapted because the recordless depth depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam of each pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the colours exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are further pursued and checked for further divisions. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. when you turn on Jittering, changes & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have not hit any object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly quit, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import one & Povray; import the scene, select the menu entry file Import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovModeler; Not yet the complete command totale of & Povray; when importing error messages or alerts, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source in & kpovModeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovModeler; and in your editor you can paste source text for & Povray; also paste.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene rendered. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in Property View, & kpovModeler; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. here, set the path to your retention and the version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type plate.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object reception of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in more accurate wire model and therefore better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects, such as the sphere, you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you tick High detail fidelity for enhanced projections, all wire model views are further subdivided if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections. this feature results in better approach for projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a checkerboard pattern from two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you tick the floor, a bottom is rowed below the objects. the bottom is represented in a checkerboard pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick to tick edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can adjust the values for depth and threshold value. more details about the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window classifications. in the window instructions section, it explains how to create and save windows instructions.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down selector standard window arrangement: displays all existing window sizes. & kpovModeler; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window classifications shows all existing window sizes. a new arrangement can be created by adding the button Add and deleting a selected arrangement using the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name displays all views for the chosen window arrangement. new views can be created by adding the button Add and Delete selected views using the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with undo you get a map view view together with the previous view and floating the view not anchored in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without any more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene among beginners: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you will receive only one black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't include sources of light, your whole scene lies in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following set-up window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation to get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should note the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. then select the scene and then select the menu entry Edit Delete. this way you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of rendering the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation of & Povray; see more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you click the Apply button or the input key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you might insert a header (insert final body boxes) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the input key. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also displays the plane, although at the moment only as a limited finite level. when you render the scene, the plane stretches out to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when you click on the item + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the exercise one unit beneath the horizon line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment select something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens, in which you can select how the object should be inserted. please select First subitem. the pigment will then change in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (Name = Ground pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the Preview of the pigment shows only a matt black material because you still need to enter settings for the pigments. therefore always remember that you can check the look of materials anytime with a click on Preview. also, there are many possibilities again, but take the easiest now.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see any color on the header and the ball in the preview, click on the Apply button and then preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you now render your picture with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. select this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to do this step, since you should have understood the basic mode of working of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget the input button or the button Apply), so the ball has contact with the floor. otherwise, the ball would float above the floor as you have moved the base around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering gives a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface looks like a matt black material. in the following step, put in a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as in the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first subobject and change the name for example in sphere pigments. click on ball's pigments, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness-effect and reflection adjustments already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good idea of the possibilities for you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you've learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracen a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical radiance from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will impact.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source, you don't see anything, the picture is just black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and memory space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Recovers the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the recently reversed command. this menu entry can only be selected when you have used Undo Undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or override an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovModeler; here you can change the look, shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcuts. you can change or add new commands to & kpovModeler with this option; modify or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler with this option; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without altering any diffraction on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in either an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files you can display with the click of the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in your own window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching file name was found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In dialog submission - & kuickshow; there are five flashcards. in three of them, General and editing and slideshow, you can set the way of & kuickshow; in the two other, short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, the shortcuts can be set for each window.</seg>

<seg id="1167">The user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner.</seg>
<seg id="1168">The other settings include more detailed options of the driver. & gulite; (libksane) does not particularly address these options.</seg>
<seg id="1169">To scan a picture, the user can only start a pre-scan and then scan scanning range for the final scan. the preview can be started by the preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1170">To better select the image, the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection. it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window.</seg>
<seg id="1171">Once the image has been selected, the final image can be read with the scan button.</seg>
<seg id="1172">If before saving a preview in the settings selected, the image will be displayed in a preview window, as shown below. when pressed, the image will be saved and scare will result in a demolition and you will get back to the main window.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You can set up existing multimedia keys so that they function as & Amarok; short commands. this will make your keyboard a & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is supposed to describe the DCOP features of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browsers and scripts. an example call for the DCOP function could be & zb; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition Amarok has some of its own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all needed modules are present and make use of the dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' rescue LoadError error = 'corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} 'exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages enable executing external programs and commands. for this, the function exec () is mostly used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason, strings are written to standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Wizard asks the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok uses the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is being played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP, the script could ask more information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomisuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a custom menu entry was clicked. submenu and itemTitle are also provided for the script to use dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; exit, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to perform tasks such as storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks Script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar-Archive (.tar), which may optionally be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend a archive name such as myskript.amarokscript.tar.bz2 so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extended amarine script. therefore, you should designate your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can download it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the Amarok category; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde; & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of working through endless menus. maybe you're looking for just a specific song from thousands in your collection. mit & Amarok; s Collecting browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have a few playlists, but you can never decide which one you want to hear? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you. and if the decision is still hard, dynamic mode and smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. furthermore, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music.</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Since & Amarok; autoconf and automake are used, you should not have any difficulties when compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compilation options, certain dependencies must be met so that they can be used. for details, see System Premises section.</seg>

<seg id="1214">External browser: lets you choose which browser of & Amarok should be started when a browser is required.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Use other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save playlists while moving, the current playlist will automatically save while moving & Amarok; enable this option if you don't want to lose the current playlist when moving.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually saved playlists: if you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, will be used. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">To keep the current piece visible when changing the play, the playlist window pops up / unrolls to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing the context browser automatically indicates the context browser as soon as the next play is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can customize & Amarok's appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; by selecting custom fonts, the otherwise gray section will be enabled. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist windows, player windows and context browsers. click Select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the Custom color scheme, you have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme. to do so, use the color selectors which are activated for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Resume playing at the start, that & Amarok; after program start, resume play automatically with the piece at the place with which it was stopped during the last ending.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Setting up the on-screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. when using on-screen display, preview the OSD will appear and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select the font for the OSD from the dialog. the check box shade causes the text to be shadowed in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the option to adjust the OSD colors for writing and background. a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection. if own colors are not activated, the preset & kde colors are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The input field display text displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is designed for Xinerama users, allowing you to determine which screen of a multi-monitor environment the OSD is supposed to appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card-card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field. some drivers enable even more configuration options in this card card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card collection is used to set all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, the & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Recurse subfolders: this causes & Amarok; both the selected as well as their sub-folders will search for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Supervise changes: allows & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists to your collection folders (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the drop down selector driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup is necessary in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup will be used to set up the database for & Amarok; under Calculator: will the machine enter where the MySql database is located. then under Port: the network port where the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Username: and Password: to enter the data required for connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The load file last.fm sets the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and, if required, create music recommendations regarding the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your load.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and so update the profile: this setting allows & Amarok; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Retrieving similar performers: after activating this setting, & Amarok; a list of similar performers can be retrieved from the played piece. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, for example, but fluxbox will work hard. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and leave the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">It is mostly because taglib crashes when reading the meta-information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of the libraries used by & Amarok have been compiled using the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, deactivate autom. switch off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens at a crash). if it is a common crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-information, but do not mark this as Unicode. the following Perl script resolves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; my $v2tag = $MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print "Error in writing the tags of $ARGV [0]\" unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>
<seg id="1253">This script requires the Perl module MP3:: Mplib. it can be reinstalled with this command: Perl -MCPAN -e 'install MP3:: Mplib'</seg>
<seg id="1254">And Amarok's symbols in the status bar (random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist) are always active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a known bug in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects are forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: icon lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmap ERK7QPixel, then check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. you can see this with ldd 'which amarokapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf to make Amarok find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Most of the installation problems are the easiest way to solve your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and IRC under irc.code.net in channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable to search for help. please enter there only one error if you are interested in fixing a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only appears an empty playlist. how come there pieces of music there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To intuitively keep the interface, the start subwindow has been converted to the Statistics window. you will find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars represent the user's rating while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate pieces, the appraisal column must be displayed in the playlist. click the title bar of the playlist and select column ads. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove and then press release on your keyboard. or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From Playlist Remove From the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist file into the playlist and drop it there, just as you would do with other files. that's how easy it is: -)</seg>

<seg id="1269">No! yes, that's true! no! & Amarok; uses a backend independent approach, so the real question needs to be loud What media types supports GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEmm?. as you can see, we support virtually any imaginable audio format.</seg>
<seg id="1270">It may! maybe you use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, with which no MP3 decoders are included in the preset (for patentable reasons). the solution: old-F2, gg: RedHat mp3, input key</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you are using the GStreamer driver with the Alsa heatsink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved with a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in finding the problem cause and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to provide a different sink (for example, sink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & Amarok; already. don't forget that media must first be decoded. you can't simply send a MP3 to ALSA, you would only hear a white noise. GStreamer reads the file, decodes them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open control center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound servers with highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDE multimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this error report. to enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help well.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either you do not use the Arts Driver, but instead use GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia complete to get the faster arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Use another driver (the xine driver has been strongly optimized for Analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts-buffer in the Control Center and Sound & Multimedia, Sound System. the smaller the buffers, the less dreamers respond to visualizations. yes, this is a mistake, please help us fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes and Amarok; why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you must register all components. run register to register all GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask in the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (exit Amarok beforehand!): - Download the ffmpeg file, compile and install it. then run all ffmpeg files in the GStreamer module folder (you will find the module folder with the-config / GStreamer-config) and execute it again. start now & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very easy. drag and drop items from the collection browser to the playlist. the small text box to filter the collection eases the search for certain pieces. if you're content with the playlist, you can save them by using the click of a button Save this button in the toolbar of the playlists window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlist, you can add it to the playlist browser. if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection, and you have enabled the playlist to import playlists, then these playlists are already in the tree view. with a right-click to a playlist, you'll get different ways to load the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1332">If you install these packages using a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player also has & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions. additionally, & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all the others.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the currently running piece or the currently running stream. a click on this area will change the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining time of play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">The player window also includes a selection of Audio Analyzers, even under the running text display. you can switch by the available Analyzer by clicking with the left mouse button in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be disconnected from the Player window. press d on your keyboard and the current Analyzer is displayed in an independent, magnifiable window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the running text display are also the PL and EQ buttons. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlists window while the EQ button is used to set equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the slider to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click on the EQ button in the player window. once you select the equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't be deterred by the abundance of features, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">In the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right you can find the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays different information about the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three sub-windows: music, Text and Interpret. these three subwindows will be explained later in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok; you might notice that the subwindow has dropped off. the information presented there has now been split into other parts of & Amarok. furthermore, the information can be collected in the Statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music below shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first area in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to smash the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You will find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz icon. you can see here how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display covers in the context browser, the covers must be in the same folder as the current piece. file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png formats are supported. the context browser will also display covers that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourites from this interpreter. this section shows the five most highly rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information in the music subwindow should be displayed. to do so, right click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will fold up and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click all the items in the individual sections to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, & Amarok try to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if you do not have a text script, you can choose which one should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the song text. the modified version is then saved in & Amarok; s collection database. for this, no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - groups only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - first the pieces are arranged according to the artist and there is a further splitting according to the respective album. if you want to see constellations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different performers.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Artist / Year - Album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are displayed alphabetically among each other. the interpreter will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / artist - your pieces are displayed first by genre and among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above but is additionally sorted by album under the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can adjust and match the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you have many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly under the toolbar is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter is a selection box, with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you are available different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours up to a year. besides, you can of course also select your total collection, whereby the filter is practically switched off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empties the current playlist and insert the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Appending to Playlist - Adds the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected songs as a playlist. they are asked for a name under which the list should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the queue to transfer to the Media Player. for more details, see the Media Player Browser section.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter burn / burn CD - This will enable the selected pieces to be sent to K3b and burned either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) move files in the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the compilation - Marks the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears among different performers.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Undo - Change a album marked as a compilation back into a normal album. after that, the album will no longer be shown in different performers but again under the associated artist.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser simply shapes the handling of many playlists. among other things, it also includes intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Self-created Intelligent Playlists are also possible. click Intelligent Playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart Playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow Media Player is used for connecting & Amarok; using your portable media player (e.g. iPod). for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod modeled by artist in the upper list view of the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list performer. if you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transfer is complete, finish & Amarok; and solve the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">The toolbar is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser you will find an address bar with which you can fetch music from a entered URL. for example, if you type tar: / home / mike / music.tar.gz and press entry paste, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag the music from there into the playlist and drop.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping down. in the event the holding down of the Shift key may be helpful: this will automatically include deleted files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all of the pieces attached to you. you can change the order by simply drag the entries to the desired place with the mouse. once you enter there letters, only the pieces are displayed that contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. if you enter, for example, one two three, the search will find all the entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR between the search terms OR, you search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR 3. in this example, all pieces that contain one or two or three will be found (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, enclose the search term with goose footprints: Mike Oldfield. this will be searched for entries that contain Mike Oldfield, but not for entries like Mike J Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This will search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something search for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then right-click in the desired order in the entries. the entries will then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add to add playlists to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next follow the undo and restore buttons. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the center of the toolbar there is a unique, magnifying analyzer. the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as the one you have displayed in the player window over the right mouse button. you can set up this menu & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for the toolbar, for example playback controls and volume control. you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and set up toolbars there... Select.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it shows the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces. in addition, the status for random mode and retrieval, a slider for playing position and playing time of the current piece will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, you can disable the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist. you can reach the settings of & Amarok using this menu.</seg>

<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big entry into & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece in the queue, a number next to the title appears in the playlist. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will be played: 1 will be played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>

<seg id="1461">Closes all opened projects and ends & k3b; for each unsaved project it is asked what to do with it as if you were calling file closing.</seg>
<seg id="1462">When you call this entry, you can select files to add to the project via the dialog window. this has the same effect as when you view the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the added files will appear in the CD's base folder.</seg>
<seg id="1463">This dialog is basically the same as the project's properties dialog. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & k3b; to burn the medium. the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described via the What is the? remedy (available via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session into the current project. this is useful if you do not use files for a multi-session CD.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry will only appear in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this feature causes & k3b to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1467">This allows you to copy a CD to another medium even without a project file. alternatively, you can only create a copy from a CD, which you can then burn later. you should also prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">This allows the copying of a DVD to another medium even without a project file. alternatively, you can only create a copy from a DVD, which you can then burn later. furthermore, you can't support the copy / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copying dialog, so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source medium in its original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Open the dialog for deleting a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Open the dialog to format a DVD. with this dialog, you can format a DVD + R (W), which will completely delete the contents. & k3b; lets you make the choice between writing modes overwrite and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">The dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button. (Nero * .nrg files are currently not supported yet, for this you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a source of data, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">This dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view, but can also be used anywhere. it contains information about the selected video, encoding settings, and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">This information is displayed in the content view and features the properties of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of toolbars of & k3b; if an entry is selected, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is enabled, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, their content will be displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locking and unlocking the drive or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view allows to select and drag files to the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area, which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the head bar has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box for changing the key assignments for & k3b; after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key signature for that further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator privileges are required, so you must type the password for the system administrator (root) at the start of the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be set. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at first. this dialog is intended for personalizing and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled, for example, via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can either use the command line dcop, or the slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and nature of your task is crucial, which of the contributor programs you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the command line dcop. to use the & DCOP; functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that have common all & kde; program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts, which are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions like copyCD, formatted DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createAudio CDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () void proceCdimage () void BurnCdImage () void BurnCdImage (KURL url) void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject approach, one gets a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively, one can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using the # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void errameItem (QString path) void errameItem (QString path) void errameItem (QString path) void setVolumeID (Qstring path) void setVolumeID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; select for & kde; with it can easily be read audio CD; s read out and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the UI of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on the hard disk) and by many encoders that encoded these WAV files (compression). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default (These encoder packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution). more encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into MP3 or OGG format or in other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually already available for any Linux distributions, so it is most likely not necessary to compile anything yourself. however, only the encoder packages must be installed that are needed. if for example FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What encoder / file format should be used? chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already mentioned, use & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to bypass any copy protection. if not the Firmware of the & CD; / DVD device avoids the protection, it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setup must be done only once (but the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), then the daily handling of reading a & CD; on the hard disk explains. this (hopefully) will lead to an understanding of the slim approach of the user interface that you will stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without a network, everything is manually collected.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands from the main window. on the step by step, for example, you will find more information about how this program is used, as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB requests the CD data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - if an encoder was configured in the Set Settings tab in the setup catalog - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the default. note that before the encoder settings in the setup dialog, the encoder was configured in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (like logs, pics) for program events (such as reading the & CD; completed).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main directional dialogue by & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (such as Encoder, for setting up the Encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes audio quality, encoders and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC, there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'which may be available for this distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may now have a light advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bitrate the differences become less important because both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is still supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared with OGG to slightly lower quality for lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or machine based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playsets exists.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see the 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset Extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you don't want to have the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information obtained manually or retrieved by the program automatically from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. they can be passed / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program preferences for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; title to keywords (English: day) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -t {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button identification in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of entering the machine itself. it is important to note that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of translator: this is the author) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select an address field (sending an address). for the use of freedb may be used with another (forged) address than the one in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears that the email address is not used when retrieving data from the server (but this can only be the programmer who has reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; set up to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia will be used; if you want to know more exactly, search the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution needs to be installed first if this has not been done yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For the first opening there are pre-defined lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the encoder. other encoders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed by the respective Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoders.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can receive more information about its switch by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; Console). this must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device designation of the & CD; / DVD disk, the write and reader review on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this won't work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you are using other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood it all but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and use our first & CD; read. we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine, as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission (eg; trying to copy it into the / usr / share / cd).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator;, something that will probably only be done once, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each taping & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to use for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) and the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them at any time you read a & CD; change if the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the reader program, so it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device designation of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device labels for CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The tab General Settings. here there is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is as loaded / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information ask for information so that you will be informed if statements are missing for the creation of keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The box CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the machine must be connected to the freedb server while reading the & CD; it must be connected to the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, becomes a & CD; entry found begins immediately reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you later are dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory names / file names or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory and filename will be changed with konqueror &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode, consider this twice whether this is worthwhile. to use freedb in offline mode, the two choices must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for data enquiry, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server nearby. however, this option will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, but as many firewalls are booting the protocol 8880 by default, there might be more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transmit data to the freedb server. to disable the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of pieces at the same time: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, therefore simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Discard CD; discard after reading the last piece: check this to the CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wav files are stored. if the box is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something yourself with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be flattened to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is approximately 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted as needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files at the same time: with a dualcore or quad or even a multi-processor machine, you can try to code more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have cleverly chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it describes how the process of reading the & CD; the disk runs on the hard disk. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described in the previous section and set up. first, a connection to the internet is set up because we are comfortable and the & CD; the process described in this section must be repeated for each taping & CD; repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a CD, which is not yet included in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from the data fetched by freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; collect data manually instead of retrieving it from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not the & CD; find this example. it's a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this hasn't happened yet, the & CD now has to be pushed into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a brief moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, check the FAQ and answers section for help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully fetched from the freedb, all songs are already completed and the name of the artist and album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; a window appears, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you haven't selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but retrieve the data from the internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - input the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the input field 'Current Title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments separately, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successfully retrieving the data from the freedb the CD-editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for comment field.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see Help for the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the tapered CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to freedb.org website and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After selecting 'OK', go back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD Editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there's a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are so marked will be read. a simple click on the line will turn off the selection of the piece. make sure all the pieces are selected, or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If the selection process is selected by clicking on the selection button, then this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the Rider button to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will show you if you are trying to work with a encoder you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example. did you check if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece's reading.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Job 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: job 4 is the coding of piece 1 in MP3 format. this takes out reading and coding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that appears to be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. for low-performance machines, the result is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is encoded and a third order appears in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the top left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For successful use of audio-Creator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you will need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Most distributions, however, already include pre-compiled packages, as & kaudiocreator; a part of an important & kde package. if you read this, you probably already did it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people who compile from source files, and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls up many different programs has many options. it is best to read the step by step, for example, to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the different index cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first start of the program, without any clue how it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if at the time of program starts no audio CD; in the drive), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? anyone who reads this has probably already started the program. it should look somehow like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately, no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; it is intended to do so. at least only after the contact with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and therefore agrees with this proposal.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke player from & kde; besides others, with real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of texts also has some properties that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; & kmid; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver, which is needed for GUS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop so that you can drag in & kde; any MIDI file from a & konqueror; window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically determines the procedure used each time.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you & kde finish; when playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the Lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window. this also works with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the play button in the toolbar, select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will start automatically as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; window. (in more than one piece they will be added to a collection and then played sequentially.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the speed display and thus change the playback speed. to restore the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar, like pressing a button pause or selecting the menu entry break in the menu, interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; play.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text owning, others use lyrics owning and some other both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can choose which events to be displayed and even better: the equestrian style is automatically determined which uses a song so that you don't have to manually set the edit menu. however, if you select the Automatically Text option in the settings menu, the karaoke lyrics will be automatically selected.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an e-cognitive type, select text events or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are played in series. in this section, you will find how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find this in the menu Collection below the item Organize.... Click on New and specify the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection. at the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired one in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection will not be saved. consider this if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the button Add. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. then, this collection will then be added to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the submenu of the menu Collection menu, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song button, next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To bounce back a song, select the Previous piece, the previous one from the menu item, or press the arrow arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter as it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not general MIDI. in this case, the MIDI-map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you do not need a MIDI-map because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe and Gus cards, FM equipment and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file which stores all the required replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. but the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text id (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of Keymap"... END Define keymap "A more Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I will in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General-MIDI compliant.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, you specify how the patches of General MIDI can be mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 tools.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to set all sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the M number. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gunshot. to do this, add the following to the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60 regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is the term "drum patch" of the patch, where each sound is a different percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;), and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as is their presence. therefore you have to write 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple key maps for each channel and instrument. you just have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Key maps are used primarily to make notes on the percussion channel. take a look at the provided Keywords.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channels, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keyword will naturally be defined in the file name. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored which will attempt to change the patch on that channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch can be useful, for example, to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch Bender event with the value n, this is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard, which is a pitch Bender event with the value 4096, should play a note higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two notes up to a octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you will find this in the menu under Settings, item MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole row of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see what sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed a tool, the button will no longer light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views (up to now) to display the played sounds. in the View menu, select Settings under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find e.g. a song too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc;. this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's homepage)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add any files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, so support & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror; select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, enable Automatically Add to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have opened one & konqueror; -Desktop with my MIDI-Folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or tacked (if I want to play a karaoke file), I just have to switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection, turn off Automatically Add to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so set the Automatically Add to the collection and open A.Ther. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Málaga. at the moment I'm studying for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: larpink @ kde.org or antlarr @ armois.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">They make me really happy if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will enumerate (if you want this). but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me since I might have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my free time and doesn't get money from anyone. I would like to stress that I only keep programming because / when I receive feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Peter Gritsch, Magnus pepper, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error message or even a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course also thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net, giving us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, & kmid; also found on its homepage, which is located under http: / / www.armo.es / ~ rlarpink / kmid.html. on the homepage you can watch the development, search for information and look at pictures. you will also find links to sites with additional karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you have a sound card, except that you can't listen to music, of course.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems arise, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by MPlayer or phonon, as well as to play DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called dockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only appear when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save preferred connections from the bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played on each other, you should use the category Permanent Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an extra hierarchy level. when you click an item, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback will begin with the clicked record.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The different files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. just click on a name of a category, select it from the View menu and next edit mode. by clicking on a subgroup, only the XML content of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, select the same with playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected, without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 obtainable option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during start-up doesn't need to be short, it will automatically end by opening another source. however, this would be disturbing at the end-animation, so the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite picture: & lt; header; img dur = "incurrente.src =" file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" search "; & lt; / Follows; & lt; / Follows; & lt; / Follows; & lt; / Follows; & lt;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here, the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream can be set from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'Console' button in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, just like setting the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' with the module swfdec-mozilla is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the & KMPlayer; 'flash' to play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer must be specified as service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. the designed process is called knpplayer. if there are no errors here, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that always a given backend for a particular mime type is taken (of course only if this is also determined), this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon should return all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& SMB; can be played by TV cards, either via MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. for this purpose, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog appears in the Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there you should recognize ports from which one is selected. the code to be used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). this is also only supported on the first screen (: 0.0). for this reason, the videoforlinux enhancement must be supported in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally they use different names for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introresource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, url source, vcdsource and vdren.if enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there any hints on how to make my CDROM drive more quiet when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom can be executed as root after connecting the device. it is essential to make sure that / dev / cdrom is on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why does my CPU have to be checked for performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right language: Lay-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to use, a Laie (lay) & latex; -macros can also be used. a less challenging but more realistic explanation is that it comes from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In order to be able to master properly, good books include H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: Document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The introduction contains at least the command\\ documentclass, the body starts with the command\\ begin {document} and needs to be closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The quick entry assistant of & kile; is a useful function for the quick creation of a document in & kile; the selection of the wizard (menu) provides some options for creating the document. you can also make some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this allows the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [letter], article (DIN) [scrartcl], report (DIN) [scrartcl], projector [scrartcl], projector [scrartcl], slides [prosper] or user defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this is used to set the character encoding. modern systems are increasingly using the UTF-8 encoding as default. at best UTF-8X should be selected (for correct processing of the latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used add-on packages for & latex; for integration they only need to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), Book (DIN), letter (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users do not need to worry about this. it is just a brief description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& kile; offers - just like other source code editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). through & kile; if you see more elaborate areas of a green text on the screen, it is likely that any mathematical environment has not been closed.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic completion of environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) of & kile; automatically creates a blank line (for the input of the text) and the corresponding line to make the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be kicked in the menu... LaTeX commands can be deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually grouped into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document to the following elements (apart is the highest and sub-paragraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files, recovery search can be very helpful. once a DVI; file [e V ice I ndependence File]] was created, & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the usual output art of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back-up search, the elements of the DVI file are connected to the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI file was clicked, the corresponding section in the & latex; the default text is the exact opposite of it. as soon as you clicked on a section in the & latex; -source code, the corresponding place in DVI; -viewer is jumped.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, work with others is simplified .tex files are simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Fast construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is displayed automatically (unless there are any errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is on the right hand side, and there is no call from & eyepiece; after fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When looking at the edit toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for the quick integration of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for the quick integration of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other range is for items such as keywords, notes or references. the options available are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Description: with this command, a name for a section, an image or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified designation (select a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">The author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; and & kbib; and & kbib; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop down box with the name GrÃ ¶ re is used for determining the font size. it can specify the font sizes for the main text, the guides, etc. the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses under the\\ documentclass command contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font size is not set at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example is entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the simplest way to do this is to use the Menu Builder or button Fast Construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & kile; it automatically executes the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document fails, you should search for errors in the logging process. if you use Fast Construction, you should automatically start logging. if this is not the case, the logging process should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will then allow to change the font size within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are supervised only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many options to increase readability and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold prints, italics, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italics pressure and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be represented with\\ emph {Word} italics.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Percentage: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {ratio}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source text with the & latex; description language has been presented, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile is now followed.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be made. for this, at least one quote, a few places in the bold and italics pressure and a poem should come to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted to an & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI file, the same steps as for creating the document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed (in the viewer) using File Print (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the transformation of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; source code has been created, the conversion into changed other formats by means of buttons in the toolbar can begin.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-select search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; binaries. to do this, only modern under Settings box must be set up... tools can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to select the pre-select search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source text and then clicked on pre-select search. the jump to the appropriate place in DVI; the viewer takes place then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -Document of & kile; open and jump to the appropriate line.</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error in using the quick assembly of the & DVI; if an error is present, it will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file describes the source code in the source code. in the editor you can see the errors of the LaTeX error and the first LaTeX error for springing between the errors. in order to look at the faulty line, you have to click on the error in logging and & kile; jumps to the wrong line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the preset options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can either be written from scratch or the wizard is used to quickly create a new document. more information on this can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Ufiger users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file created.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a file New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings... Preferences are set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by input into document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps have to be completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, one's own template can then be selected rather than the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files will be created. if a simple way to create a template will be searched for one on the internet and the steps described below will be searched.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and hebrew from many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To find out more about posters and its options, the manual to Kate should be used. users of & kile; can start reading the chapter's work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be invoked by the LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be used in & latex; use as well as its syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that in this way clicking on\\ par\\\ bigskip is only selected by\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source text can be selected in the Editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the possibility to browse and highlight various types of source codes. for example, the & latex; -commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can also gain additional jumping tokens. this is a special type of bookmark inside the text. the menu items Edit bounce marks or the corresponding key rings enable the jump to the next or last jump mark. this is also highlighted by this jumping brand, so that it is automatically retrieved at the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & kile; although & kate; already excellent options are added in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; & latex; works always many environments and groups and therefore supports & kile; special commands for their selection. under Edit Choices are the following commands for selecting the text:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only exploitative thing in & kile, is that the abscesses are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word from the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, since this command also displays & latex; commands with a back stroke (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To create a part of the document, it is possible to select this first and remove it by pressing the Delete key. & kile; offers the key root Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & kile; offers with its own commands for a faster possibility. under Edit Removing are the following commands to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been made clear that environments play a central role in & latex; for this reason & kile offers; for more commands in editing environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command jumped to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to flatter the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command jumps to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to connect the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the\\ begin {environment} instruction, jumps to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview can be lost quickly. this command buys the most recently opened environment, so that the nested ambient structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups defined by parentheses {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that match those from the Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command jumped to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the curly clip.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command jumps to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly close bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is located before or behind the curly clip of a & tex; group #, the other end of the group is jumped (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">With the input of many nested welded group clamps quickly the transition can be lost. this command buys the most recently opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple reference marks are used as examples. for the appropriate implementation it is used in & kile; the character is used for two simple reference marks. also for the end of the application the character is used. & kile; knows this case and add two additional leading characters for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double entry badge can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There can also be a number of other languages (e.g. german or French), so that German or French suits can be used. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When holding Shift; Enter key for & kile; an intelligent line reversal. if the current position is located within a lists area (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & kile; not just a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment, complete & kile; the current line with\\\\ with an adjacent line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or custom environments. these can be set up under Settings... LaTeX will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange columns in tables environments and thereby arrange all the Et characters (amp;) among each other. & kile; try to achieve this. while pressing Shift; Alt; amp; search & kile; after the next tab in the underlying line.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already offers good source code retrieval, it was added in & kile; for special orders (usually for & latex;), three different modes are built. all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings Kile... Comprehensive.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment}, & kile; automatically adds the command\\ end {environment} following an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and erroneously enlarges the complete list. on the other hand, the list can also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions will be removed naturally by selecting a command. alternatively, you can also enter the jump marks, so that an easy jump to these positions can be possible by editing the jump marks NÃ ¤chst jumping brand and then the desired parameters can be added.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Settings can be set up; set up... kile; Enable settings can be made to these lists. you can select different host lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as wireakers of the general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not necessary for re-enactment of environments. there are always a few letters to begin with\\ begin and the call of the completion mode will result in a large list with environmental commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & kile; a special mode for completing the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">The command to open the environment is automatically filed and it appears\\ begin. after that, the ambient completion can be continued in the simplest manner and will be terminated by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is accomplished, the environment will automatically be closed again. once & kile; recognize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is filed with it.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box, set up... kile; Enable settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of completion of the completion mode for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; supports custom lists of distractions that are immediately replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Kile... Kile Forms can be set up. for example, the file example.cwl, in which for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the character L is entered and the word completion mode is introduced over the menu Editing Firing or Ctrl + Alt Space, the character L is replaced by the character string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large-scale wipers are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many readers are written in a document more than once. this provides & kile; the complete termination for all those already written.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu box... Kile Forms can be shut down. here, the threshold value for the display of the full-length can also be set.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / kile / complete / mode / of the local home folder. mode is available for abbreviation (cooling), dictionary (dictionary) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The graphic design dialog designs the graphics as easy as possible. to view the basics to the graphics formats, the sections should be considered and considered.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as popular as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To be able to understand the result of the work, the source code must be compiled. all building tools are groupwise in the creation compiling, creating and creating views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer such as & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used by pressing alt; 2. then, the DVI; file can be viewed in the standard viewer by Alt; 3, using Alt; 4, the DVI; file can be converted to a PS file and viewed by Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick Building instruction, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no viewer is used, a new window will open each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be asked about the project "Neues Projekt." the following information is retrieved for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When setting the file name window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function of & kile; allows the executing of the ECMAScript code. the scripts can be administrated by scripts in the vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet fully developed and can still change in other versions of & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution of the scripts in & kile; a system-wide object (= kile) with the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a rather sophisticated system in which basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages. & kile; offers a lot of different help to support users.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & texlive; are shipped with many documents. included are a documentation for the packages contained and another & latex; reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">This is not just a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather is a complete manual for the search for a specific formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Because of the quantity of documents with those & tetex; / texlive; the finding of the right document is not always easy. as possible help offers & tetex; / texlive; the small application texdoctk that contains a database with all the documents supplied and for a graphical surface.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are subdivided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or tags.</seg>
<seg id="1867">Double-clicking with the mouse or the space button opens the viewer to the document.</seg>

<seg id="1899">You can disable, deactivate or delete a stop point using the buttons, the Debug menu, or the icons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Most part of the output from & kxsldbg; is captured and displayed either in the stage manager... Dialogue or in the & kxsldbg; output window. the following exceptions are:</seg>
<seg id="1901">The various tools are available via the debugging menu, where the stage manager is most important.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Clicking on the step-by-step executing in the menu will display a dialog for choosing the speed of the running speed.</seg>
<seg id="1903">To stop the procedure, press the W button or select step-by-step executing in the menu.</seg>

<seg id="1910">All found templates are listed here. note that the export rules of & XSLT are valid. therefore, multiple templates can be present with the same matching and mode details.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Clicking on a template entry in the displayed list moves the text pointer in the main window to the corresponding line of this file.</seg>
<seg id="1912">Local and global variables are shown on a tab in the Xsldbg inspector dialog. the following example shows XSLT source code, where a global and a local variable is declared</seg>
<seg id="1913">By clicking on a variable from the list, you will receive a summary information in the dialog below. if a variable has a particular expression, for example</seg>
<seg id="1914">Contains, then a new XPath can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking on the expression button.</seg>
<seg id="1915">When you click on a variable entry in the list, the text pointer in the main window will be transferred to the corresponding line of this file.</seg>
<seg id="1916">Version 3.2 of & quantaplus; contains many new & XML; tools and functions. these tools are unique in their integration in & quantaplus. all these tools use commanders as surface and libxml2 and libxslt as base. the combination results in fast, efficient, complete and productive tools.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Anyone who worked with the & kde; documentation knows me proc and how superior it is. let's lift it a bit, we give it a graphical surface! no more dependent on a terminal; simply clicked on the icon for the XML processor and done!</seg>
<seg id="1918">This application expects a index.docbook in the folder. if the index.docbook is in the waxed working folder, let the current working folder be checked. if not, then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders.</seg>
<seg id="1919">Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous & HTML files are deleted each time myproc is started.</seg>
<seg id="1920">As I said before, everyone who worked at the & kde; documentation knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus, there is now a great graphical surface for it.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the newly opened file is index.docbook, simply select the current working folder. if not, then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index.docbook is to be found.</seg>
<seg id="1922">When it comes to an output on the screen, your file is erroneous. please check the reported errors and try again.</seg>
<seg id="1923">If the file to be checked is already checked in & quantaplus, then the current file is simply clicked. if not, delete the file in the current file and select the file to be checked by means of a different file - file selection.</seg>
<seg id="1924">If you only want to know if the well-formed file is, then click the Well-formed option.</seg>
<seg id="1925">To use a & DTD; specified in the & DTD; (internal), otherwise & DTD; (default), otherwise & DTD; (External) and specify the location of the & DTD; by definition URI; file selection. both for the & W3C; & XML; scheme as well as for the RelaxNG check is the definition of the definition URI; in the file selection required.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Yes, & quantaplus; has also a & XSL; processing tool! this uses the xsltproc tool from the libxml2 library.</seg>
<seg id="1927">If the file to be processed in & quantaplus is already selected, simply select the current file. if not, remove the current file and select the file to be processed by means of the other file file selection.</seg>
<seg id="1928">Specify the name of the file as the result should have named. the file is normally stored in your home folder.</seg>
<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus, have to do with & quantaplus. thus, the plug-in system is very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait until someone builds the desired in & quantaplus. the plug-ins can be used in a large number of & GUI; more about it below.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a part, we start the Edit menu with the Edit menu. this opens the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all contained plug-ins and add new ones. we describe each and GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a location use & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often work on a project involves several people in a sort of hierarchical relationship with each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift; F7 project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders as well as subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select from the list of team members who he is. this happens by looking the team member out of the list and clicking the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the attitude of one's own identity are important in terms of news and comments. see for further information on notes.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: an event for information can be created to the team leader when something specific happens. see also for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens within the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that enters a file into CVS, as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page event configuration of the Shift; F7 project project settings dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project leader. see how such leaders are set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">To enter notes is simple. either the note entry from the editor context menu can be chosen or the @ annotation keyword will be entered in a comment area followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), with nickname the inserted nickname of the team member, plays a role in the project from the following possibilities: team leader Subproject leader After the area and sub-project ladders, the corresponding area or sub-project names should be given as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-insensitive, but spaces for parentheses and names are invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages, which is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings can be reached via the settings menu. here, only via & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using Setanta settings... This dialog comprises some pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags, including car completion, can be changed. entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically added tags. normal size / lowercase means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically added attributes. normal size / lowercase means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if checked, tags for which the closing tag is optional will be inserted immediately after & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Non-optional tags automatically include: as above for all other tags, except for the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update the starting and ending day: if enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the appropriate encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetyps for detecting various types of files. using the Standard button, the default settings can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard code encoding: the coding of newly created or otherwise as file opening files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is fired from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is then fired from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies regularly, so that in case of a power failure or crash next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as storing the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in one's own view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the default window settings to the default at the next start is useful if the user interface is confused by modifying the MDI modes and / or depending on the views. it corresponds to the --resetLayout command line parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The location to change the behavior of VPL; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behaviour of the VPL- and source code view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the illustration of the parser nodes in the document, can be adjusted in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action resolved by clicking on the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the field of structure tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the tree update frequency while editing, and how deep with a change in the structure tree will be automatically opened. empty knot are empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each one can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the ifclause abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here, the plug-ins can be managed. plug-ins are Kpart applications from third party, which can be reused by any part-enabled application, the most known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin, if it is not in a default such as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information will be passed to the plugin at the start, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Loading a component in the "Read Only" mode: check if the plug-in denies the loading. only read-on-parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then test & quantaplus; if the inserted information is correct. selecting allows to save the entry, even if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it shall be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redesigned. support for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as is the support for the dbg debugger. instead, a debugger plugin was implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, support for using & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the debugger plugin, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view that lists all holding points, with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view showing the output (as in HTML) of the debugger. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the debugger's supported functions, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action is used to connect to the debugger if necessary, or it tells the plugin to listen to debug requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that in the normal case it is not necessary to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the listening according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to request a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it is started before a debug request is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, execution goes on. if it happens before a debug has been specified, the execution starts as soon as a requirement is provided.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script, without entering the features or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include files.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next as if there was not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work of Keith Isdale and this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a front end and a part of xsldbg, which they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many more works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adapt & quantaplus to your needs and how to help you become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editor packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to provide support for markup and scripting languages as well as & CSS. they enable & quantaplus. their simplicity and flexibility make & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS,. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag file and the toolbar. tag folders are handy, symbolic tags of picture buttons (above the editing window), which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details for converting.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create tagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the property dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; self. toolbars enable quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a writer.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag files carry the name of the description language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags but contains nothing else than just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the class class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Valid only for the Type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and the attributes inside this tag can be added to each other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">This text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of attribute. in addition, it contains additional tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus. will be used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a editing and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day grouped together the elements of a list. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (for example one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements which may occur within the defined tag. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements ending a day. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with an & XML; & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing, but pay attention to & & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause leg breakage, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is above in the & quantaplus; -windows to start and select TagXML. to choose. another dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check takes place only when the tagXML files are loaded in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 tagXML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tagXML file is supposed to be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 tag XML file. in this file, one & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this tagXML file is supposed to be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD processing DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & file descriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = deployment 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD specification. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... to be created. click New action to enter the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the user defined button, a shortcut can be assigned; with one, the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered a text in the details settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use as input (or parts of the document), started. examples from & quantaplus. even the Schnellstart dialog or the various see in... Actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, as sh% scriptdir / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in your path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the current document URL. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus. this is used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document, or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can accept input from & quantaplus. in the input field input can be determined what to send to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected Text: the selected portion of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable normally only makes sense with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; errors can be specified, which should be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the output drop output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the check-up.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to specify actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day has attributes and you plan their use, enable dialog "Edit Tag" when available so that you can input when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let us replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Diagrams other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixel by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green will usually be regarded as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking on this icon will insert; start; -Day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it still has to be connected with the action. this is done via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and select the desired action. beside the text field there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the saved symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so there are some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want some common & quantaplus; add functions to the toolbar or it should be shared in several groups for a better overview by some separators. open the toolbar setting dialog via Settings tool bar. make sure the toolbar you want is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar might believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by halving all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Backup in the correct folder. after New XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the correct folder.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable increase of & quantaplus. for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus. check whether someone has already done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. we'll leave the first part to you, we will handle the second part here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for example HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = func1.html tag1 = tag1.html tag2 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic syntax...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the shaft depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is directly referenced to a file (and consequentially displayed at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but pay attention & & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to form the context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script should display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context-related context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation has been used to the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else. at various points there is an email menu item, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool bar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus users can download them. contributions are reviewed and only available if our team considers them to be correct and useful for publication. to make a new contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which there is a GPG / PGP key.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the dialog New resource the input fields must be filled out (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menu, upload tool bar toolbar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examine & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the Author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet supported by & quantaplus. however, the creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in tagXML format. there is a simpler way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The transformation can be started from the DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. then, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions line: the string that should appear in the Doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, & quantaplus; after converting the file descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand them and to gain full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarise themselves with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the work area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus. all that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars, actions and patterns in a global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS, pattern up to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emoglicht the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editor window, the tree views, the index cards with information and the toolbars. please consult, and for more information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries, such as closing, deleting, deleting or uploading the document, skip to a bookmark or executing CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editor area leads to a further context menu concerning the edited document contents, such as basic processing steps (cutting / pasting / pasting), editing the tags on the mouse, using the word below the mouse-cursor or opening the file, when the string is called a file under the mouse-cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if they want to insert a simple tag, e.g. & lt; insert into their document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now, you can enter the data for this just added day. if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open and strip them. in the presentation with card holders are available for files, project, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage medium can be done with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another way of using & quantaplus, is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; all options are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus. global templates are always available, local templates only for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of reintegration in Global, Local and Project works here too. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by clicking on an element, a list of commands opens with respect to navigation and refresh the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, it can quickly change attributes and namespaces. the entry system geared to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. it can be pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus. you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder Doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be appended, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be reached using the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in the Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document markup. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command. the chocolate bar of the toolbar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive via & kmail; if you receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is sensible if you want to customize the location of the / quantaplus. for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and do not execute here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is located in PATH in front of their bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus; optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While attempting to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a nearby idea: what if & quantaplus; a standalone, extendable markup language editor? well, this would make it the absolutely most powerful web development tool for & kde! so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for that the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of Why Developing what already someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; framework is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers to expand how they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus. allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation can be increased almost any task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for a fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is not associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the more detailed documentation is with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and managed by Eric Laffront Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest entry taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. look into the section about templates. should they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts the special characters to & HTML from the clipboard when inserting from the clipboard, so that they are displayed correctly and are not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard into & URL; -Description, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily to insert & URL; s used in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">This allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages exist!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Switch off and switch the problem area porter at the bottom of the & quantaplus, main window. the problem reporter will be activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set Bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu with the entries Predictions or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu, grouped by the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows to copy video files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde, and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus. the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus, see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. it just creates the name. actions need to be specified by setting actions... Add tool bars are saved through tool bar toolbars, or you will be asked when you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the tool bar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; that made you or anyone else and convert to & quantaplus. own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refreshing the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be freshened, without renewing the entire & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission is not present in the global KDE folder, the load will fail.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML,) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / promotions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag preferences dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Currently, this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent integration means that & quantaplus. inserting through tool bar is denied if this day is contrary to the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed below the above menu items. clicking on it activates it. clicking on an activated plug-in will be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available predation schemes depends on the current version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line-end identification. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; by using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instantaneous switching between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, the switch can sometimes need time or cause unattractive graphics. recommended is the index card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode corresponding to the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will enable the corresponding subwindow to be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Shuts off the status bar on the lower edge of the & quantaplus. main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of posters, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you delete entries from the toolbars or add them and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help corresponding to the mouse pointer environment, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be completed from top to bottom, since the whole directory structure is completed automatically for the rest of the project, e.g. after filling out the project name. all of these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here's the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.g..de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field blank, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates for the project are saved. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which toolbars are saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and modify. if you have server-side scripts (e.g., Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started anew from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This displays a list of files in the root folder. you can select the files you want by hooks or, by removing the tick, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. in the menu with Project Properties menu, these settings can be uploaded in the menu tree in the subwindow profile or changed using the Shift; F7 key shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholder possible), which can be re-read for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional options to the above, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">High load profiles (see in) can be set up in the subwindow profiles, as well as showing a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, by pointing one's own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration window, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration, event actions can be switched on and these actions can be added, changed or deleted. event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, it opens & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior cannot be influenced at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project is displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management view gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and opened with... in the context menu, which can be viewed with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button is displayed to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten at the end of the program. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the more insecure password on the disk save option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many upload profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a risk. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it can't be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar in the Project or Project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus to their own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus are best displayed using the toolbar menu. usage and addition differ. adding tool bar is treated below in the Add-On toolbar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu (right-clicking on the toolbar), in which New action, a new toolbar can be created, it can remove other actions like tool bar, rename tool bar or adjust tool bar, which actions on these or other tool bars should be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries are added to the action and actions are displayed that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu... and set settings actions..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code snippets and files for linking. & quantaplus. templates are basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus. provided templates have conditions for their deployment. please read the conditions mentioned at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be any file except text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary Templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specific documents are nested in appropriate subfolders. you will create a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in an appropriate way to be efficient.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area will always be included in the documents again and again. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve whole websites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As a template save as local template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (even if it is saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree below project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As a template save option as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn using drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as drag and drop or insert via the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project files tree view, you can click on a folder on the right and create a site template, enter and secure a name for the template. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can set headlines and footers or dynamically integrate with & PHP; create, insert or link files. in addition, you can keep a few things in mind when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow Templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / .kde / share / Quanta / Quanta / Quanta / Quanta / Quanta / templates / Quanta / templates / Quanta / templates.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, click the template with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three types described previously; files, text or templates.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the root folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set in such a way, it would disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in the case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text tree. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows predefined or provided text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows to equip a whole presentation by copying contents into a folder with special headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a full list of commands for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one location to another using the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be accessed via the View menu. the first mode substitutes the source code editor by the VPL; editor and the second, splits the editor window into two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and cursor appears. then you can edit and revert to source code editor if necessary, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that contains & PHP; a small green symbol shows the default of PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit it, the source code editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Second mode works just like the first one except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously. pressing F9 activates this mode, this mode is already active, offset the active cursor from one window to the other, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor is configurable via Settings Quanta. by selecting VPL; -View you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in general the recommendation is: a small span for fast computers and a large margin for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, tools document properties can be selected. this allows you to edit invisible tags when working with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created using the VPL; editor. this allows you to modify the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key word 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Using the cursor is possible, as in a word processor, by moving arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves strangely. the selection functions as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way through the toolbars, such as in the source code editor. it must be noted that inserting tags previously existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. when an anchor day, surrounded with text is inserted, any other surrounding anchor day must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the table wizard or the Listen-Wizard are disabled. later, they will work in the & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists must be used toolbars.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & knu3;? let me explain briefly why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was a lot of conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, lots of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently of each other in a piece of code and make changes. the merge editor under the differences window allows you to resolve conflicts and at the same time displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screen shot shows & diff3; folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and reflect the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you need to check code frequently, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more trouble if no one changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other one is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can ease your typing by writing only the file name of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2-diff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder folder folder Folner3 folder 3 folder folder 3 folder 3 folder 3-o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog permits manual typing of filenames, selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the Open dialog reveals your selection and displays it again next time. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of differences is done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the Folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merging or merging of folders is introduced. if a file is selected for A, however, a folder will be used for B and C, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can do it later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setting button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting the merge / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard to the active comparison window. the comparison begins immediately. in the opening dialog, you do not have to select files, you can close the dialog with the break button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar features. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you'd need to create two corresponding files, upload them in & kdiff3, and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret drag and drop text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data may be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The Info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename, and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (note that window C is optional.) If the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest a while above the line.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed via the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, you can see in the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. this is good to see in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences have been found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + + for example, white signs are only relevant in strings and comments, for pre-processor and in a few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no rows. if the line breaks are enabled, the line is dotted with rows of broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the message output:, the filename and [changes] if you have edited the result. usually, it contains already text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons Springe to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference at the same time must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also create a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to automatic merging or manually editing; this is only a placeholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a selection that you might copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The Text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting sources ignores the numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly with the scroll bars and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side up, start, end, Ctrl start and Ctrl end, Siw as you are also used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the default window, you can also use the other keys to edit. with the Insert button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl-picture inward) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl paste). if this is enabled, you will automatically copy the option to the clipboard and the manual copying is not applicable. however, be careful with this option because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use cart retraction + newline\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line ends of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when you exit and will be restored at the next start. (menu Settings- &gt; KDifficult...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides typefaces with variable width, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, you will see differences in italic script. if the selected script does not support this presentation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered astert. on these systems, the preset button automatically displays an uncorrected color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted at the pressing of the tab key. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Pressing Enter or Return, the indenting of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. then the manual copying to the clipboard is then omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which type of line you prefer to store. the default value is the generally usual choice on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">While comparing files try & kdiff3; first, all completely identical rows in the source files. only during this first step can be ignored white signs. in this step, white signs are ignored. even when merging, white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, others save only one newline character '\'. usually ignored & kdiff3; the carriage return character is made visible, but like a white character. during merging, this option must be disabled. in default, this is downlighted.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is downlighted. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is downlighted. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In Automatically advanced mode, this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will be displayed before continuing to jump to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white signs are less important in many files. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then use the options Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the Auto option also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge. check for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Modify the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need to & kdiff3; quit and restart to make the change active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The code for coding appears a short notice of what the local coding is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are handled and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding to use for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessor commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) This option allows you to set the output of preprocessor commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress the emphasis of changes in white characters in the text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when comparing three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded overall column. but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just send out the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes consider the differences and then decide abruptly to merge the files. merging the current file in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as default output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first given to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that suits your needs. you can use this function, for example, to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first given to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. the output of the command is only used for line balancing. you can write your own preprocessor that suits your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow the user to learn more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program this yourself. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this Pre-Processing command for newlines to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (\\\ 1 /\ 1 / 'This. * is a special expression that captures all characters in one line. the\\ 1 in the substitution string refers to the found text in the first block. the\\ U converts the text found in capital letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all of them follow the same pattern $keyword generating text $\\ $\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like those regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDifficul. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for line balancing. sed's / [0123456789.-] / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi-deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the conditions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead, you can use something else like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replace / SCHALTER 'However, perl some details are different. where sed\\ (and\\), perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal pre-processor are retained for viewing and merging. the other operations only alter the data that the newline algorythmus can see.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal pre-processor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to work in a folder for many files. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you only need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as base. if no target folder was specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start, do not merge. to start merging, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">When you read the folder, you will be informed about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folder, only the files that have been compared to that time will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is finished, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is displayed in a tree here. you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can fold up a folder by double-clicking on the + / - or by double-clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories can be opened and all sub-directories can be folded up with which you can open or open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if merging is started, you will be informed about any problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries varies.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. at folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, is red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, deleting the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, deleting the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copying from A (or if A does not exist, deleting the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option synchronize directories is active. then select & kdiff3; select the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filename for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option to select a new file instead of merge (unsure) is enabled, then examine & kdiff3; the date of the files and displays the newer file for copying. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not eliminated, merging the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, one file is processed after the other. you Status column displays Fertig if the merge operation was successful, and correspondingly different messages if something unexpected appeared. if merging is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is selected Full analysis in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will show more columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the matching actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you don't have a destination folder, then in the Three Folder merge mode, C is used as the target, while the two-folder merge operation B is chosen as the target and when synchronizing, A and / or B will be used as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries should be in the target folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options that might be skipped by the specific entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / resume in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to merge only the current entry, select the action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If there are still invalid merge actions due to conflicting file types, a message appears that indicates the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options Performing, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merging a single file), a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you're done with a file, select / resume directory merge / continue or press F7. if you haven't already saved, a corresponding dialog will appear. then, & kdiff3 will continue; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you click on an error, a message and detailed status information will appear. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you continue merging (F7 key), you will have the option to choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you continue merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been combined individually, these entries (in the current session) will not appear again. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (setup menu - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. multiple patterns can be entered. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that are also ignored by CVS. many self-created files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be set to a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other file systems, a preceding dot indicates a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is turned off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">In case of links to folders: if the option is turned off, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is switched on, the links will be treated as regular folders and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not run on possible recursions. a link to a folder containing a link to yourself would lead to an infinite loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a full analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of deleted, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders through a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The files are considered identical if they are equal to size. this may be useful, for example, when copying the modification date. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enable synchronize mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified. in this mode, the merge suggestions are selected to match both folders. also, the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the newer file will be proposed as an action. (this is considered insecure, as it is assumed that the other file has not been modified.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and the extension .orig. If an old backup file is already existing with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also applies to the normal merge of individual files, not only the merging of entire folders. this option is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge view is visible while merging single files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can turn off the option directory & text window and switch between the directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. to do this, use the Current File merge function from the merge menu. as soon as you save the result, the status will be returned and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: directory menu: new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open that are on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, space &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder will be displayed. then, a file is always assumed as a link destination. (ftp:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or modification date differ from the original. (note the option Confidential of the size.) (this is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is the viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP will always start the built-in differences viewer. to start KDEVELOP, press the right mouse button above the viewer viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a part, it takes & kdiff3; then degenerates & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select Preview to - KDiff3Part from the context menu. note that this does not work if none of the original files exist. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part, it only supports comparisons between two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the Kpart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now known as the compact) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff-tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or will go it like that.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from sources and probably did not tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in the default install configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiffusion 3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only one non-white character is different, the line is considered not identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is aware of any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking into the source code and selecting the A / B / C button. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file, and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has so far been too large. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src lints; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & knu3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE, please visit the homepage.</seg>

<seg id="2441">Um & kdiff3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE File indicates the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake are used, you should have no problems with compiling. if there are still difficulties, please report to the & kde; mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Umbralt Remove) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift + insert) inserts the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you will need to re-read the Update folder after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files are not copied to the target folder when merging. if the target folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the inscription A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed again when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. different characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite practical to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, exit them or shift them. this works both inside a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows within & Kpager can be moved. motion is possible both inside a desktop and on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty background of & Kpager, the context menu only displays the two entries Pager. if, however, click on an application within & Kpager, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and Finish.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows within the & Kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is enabled, the names of virtual desktops will be displayed in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field allows the & Kpager to display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is intersected along with name, the names will be provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1. working surface.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is selected, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the box.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is selected, the running programs will be displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise, only the empty work areas will be displayed to enable them to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their default symbol and pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically lets & pager; in a 2xN-grid, all virtual worktops are horizontal and vertical in a vertical row, which is very good for viewing laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini utility in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, view and move the windows as symbols or with their contents. besides, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then select switch settings... lets the dialog box appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this can't be changed in the dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpages.c with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi.

<seg id="2485">In the selection window, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button down, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifying window. this also works with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, if you press the Shift key, press the & Mb, you can move the selection window.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse-cursor harrows a while at the same place. it is meant to help people suffering from RSI syndrome (Repetitive-Strain-Injury-Syndrome) and which every mouse-click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse cursor harrows a while at the same place. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, it is also possible to have pain caused by the use of your computer. if you suffer from pain associated with using your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not occurred yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify this again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic auxiliary agents, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you stop the movement short.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is enabled, & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button emulated. move the mouse, wait until the end of the move, before letting the mouse button run. in this way, you can pull the pull at pressed mouse button. the smart move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; click on a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If intelligent delay is switched on, the shooting range is activated (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after shutdown the mouse button is waiting, before releasing the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse is done in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; if this function is enabled, a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these moves are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can drag & drop to shorten the response time. to do so, open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and click here the tab General. there is a slider sound buffer that lets you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool will be started; at any start of & kde; this function is currently only available at & kde; please consult the respective documentation at GNOME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings are reset to the status after Apply.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best thing is to use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the smart move should be switched off first. if you are then used to the automatic mouse click, you can later add the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde, if necessary, with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which areas a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not represent a link will not lead to unwanted reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. how this happens is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. dirt and dirt can be easily scrapped with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you are using intelligent delay in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor in another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of the mouse, if you want to make a keystroke. safe zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent move, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely to mark text, copy it to the clipboard, or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart shift if you just start using kmousetool; instead, select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will always play when & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the shooting time begins when intelligent delay. later, you can use the smart move without the audible click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; the XTest extension for & X window must be installed; this should be the case on most systems already.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and they are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor harrows. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and who are causing pain to anaesthetic.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait for a certain time to start a Zip process before releasing the mouse button. this way you can also drag and drop the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2549">Select the language you want for this source; & kmouth; then select the & kde; documentation. the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence. in addition, you can compare the wordlist with an OpenOffice.org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2550">With this option you can combine the available dictionaries. & kmouth; ask which dictionaries are merged, and how they should be weighted.</seg>
<seg id="2551">With this option, you can create a new, empty dictionary with no entries. since & kmouth; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary, you can create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The main section of the window for editing text passages is divided into two. in the upper part, the text passages are displayed as tree structure.</seg>
<seg id="2553">In the lower part you can edit a selected entry. if you have selected a text passage, you can change the text passage or the corresponding shortcut. if you have selected a text passage book, you can only change its name.</seg>

<seg id="2617">In & Conversation;, the IRC program of & kde; you can set up different types of messages. for example, you can set up a message where your nickname occurs in an IRC channel where your nickname occurs. with & ktons, you can then read the IRC message text.</seg>
<seg id="2618">Support a & kde; program Knotify, appears a menu item notifications in the Settings menu of this program. the possible settings for KNotfy differ depending on the application.</seg>
<seg id="2619">The file kmail.xml, which belongs to the delivery of & ktons; is a good example. it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by mail, and also the expression / local / inbox as it can be assumed in most cases as presumed.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktons; for normal work with & ktons; filter is not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is processed before being sent to the program speech-dispatcher. they are useful for improving pronunciation in order to replace wrong spoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker or to bypass certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the way filters work, it is important to know how the program "speech-dispatcher" works with a text. & ktons; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the retained orders will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important messages such as & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are continued after the output of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; have a long text read on a website, you can chat with & kmouth; someone who just enters the room. & kde; notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each job you initiate from the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are meant for the output of longer texts, which do not have any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are processed in queues except for the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktons; just one such reading will stop and terminate this issue.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen-Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders, as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there may be more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replaced parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be provided either as words or as regular expressions. & ktons; is delivered with pre-defined strings of strings that allow the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for the conversion of messages from & konversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Converter use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert from one format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktons; are some XSLT files to translate & XHTML; contained in SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With Speaker selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program sent to & ktons; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have a female voice on the card spokesman, you can read text of KDE messages about it. read more about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it will continue to pass the text on to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification is sent to & ktts; it will be processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom. processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters established. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and will not be used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the below introductory dialogs are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting up string replacement filters, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name arbitrarily, it only has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Entry. the list is processed in the order shown from above downwards.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list of a file, the entries from the file will be appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here. click the button to view a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you hold the & Ctrl key pressed at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Here a value is entered, the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs will get you with the program qdbus; the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copy-3432 indicates, you may only enter copy.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen Filter if matching. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison of words, the string offset filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. the words must therefore be limited by separators (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no manual to write regular expressions. however, if you have the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it in the dialogs adding or editing as help to merge these expressions.</seg>
<seg id="2649">& XML; Transformer translates & XML; using XSLT files from one format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such conversions. however, it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the auxiliary program xsltproc must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Specify the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is accessible via the PATH environment variable, xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the Speaker selection filter, you can send text to a specific speaker that is set up on the card speaker, or to a speaker with certain features. for example, you can set that text by kmail should be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktons; a text sent to the filter, it searches for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program provides, which sends the text to & ktons; the speaker is selected using the Speaker selection filter to override the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is installed on your system of & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions installed, you can call this one click on the button to get help in entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of the speaker you are looking for. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker will be selected to match the desired requirements. click on the right button to view the dialog box selector dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your spokesman settings, or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The Speaker selection filter will only apply to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen Filter if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>
<seg id="2658">The voice output API, by & kde; with which programmers can give their applications TTS capabilities. applications communicate with KTTSD about & dbus;.</seg>

<seg id="2675">KTTS also works with any language synthesizer, which can be launched on the command line in a console.</seg>
<seg id="2676">The list of the above languages can be incomplete or outdated. therefore, consult the description of the synthesizers to the supported languages. also check the website of ktons;, for information not included in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The program "speech-dispatcher" uses an adaptable modul-architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand and expand for the use of another synthesizer, contact the development team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSml and for the & XML; conversion filter but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and compress, you need a recent development environment of KDE (Version 3.4 or newer) including the package kdelibs and the development files for the program "speech-dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktons; from the source code archive for you, or have downloaded the currently created tarball, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use cookies, check first if the speech synthesizer works properly with your voice synthesizer. to do this, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktons; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktons; the program kttmsgr is to be developed in such a way that the device of speech-dispatcher is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is broken down into individual sentences. the user can return, repeat, pause or cancel statute or paragraph style.</seg>

<seg id="2687">Select the text encoding for text that is passed to festival. in voices, the & ktons; known, this setting is made automatically. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">These slide controls allow you to adjust volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controls and display this grey, the voice selected by you will not let these settings be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size. if you select this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of the KTTSD so that (with greater memory consumption) the first set is synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or forgot to click Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window is displayed in kttsmgr. otherwise, only the kttsmgr in the system section is visible after the start, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr does not run, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD read a text. this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the currently edited proposition. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card board speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this row, you can proceed or recede in the order, which is selected in the list below. (but not every job consists of several sentences).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on OK, all changes in the settings (also on the other index cards) are taken over and kttsmgr will be scaled down to the symbol in the system section. then click on this icon to view the program window.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message. & ktons; processes four types of voice orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. after the output of the screen reader has been read, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are continued after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks messages. if you & eg; just let a long text read on a website, you can chat with & kmouth; nevertheless someone who is entering the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, add & ktons; the audio output to the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active, the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders. for messages, warnings and the spending of Screen Readers, there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktons; Cnotify messages, start kttsmgr and click notifications. the carton card will appear alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Select this check box to activate pre-reading & kde; if this setting is not selected, the other settings are disabled and & ktons; do not read notifications.</seg>
<seg id="2712">When this setting is selected, notifications where a sound is played is by & ktons; not read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. when you click the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message, the & Conversation; sends if someone mentions your nickname in an IRC message.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events for which nothing else is specified in the list are by & ktons; ignored.</seg>

<seg id="2717">If you have selected user-defined text, enter the text you want. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter the properties of the desired speaker here. standard chooses the speaker, which is displayed in the list on the card board speaker as the top entry. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a specific application of a particular application, it will be executed. otherwise, the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application. as a last option, the action will be carried out under standard (all other events).</seg>
<seg id="2720">The Event All alerts for the application Standard (all other events cannot be deleted from the list. for this, you can set the notifications to be read as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the Save button to save settings for notifications in a file. use the Download button to load stored settings from a file. the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list. if you want to start with an empty list, click Delete. all entries except all notifications are deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSml) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, sex of voice and pitch. besides, brands for controlling the pronunciation of for example abbreviations. SSml is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktons; SSml only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (british male), as this is the standard voice, the festival used in the issue of SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100.%, SSml text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! Doctype speak PUBLIC "- / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN" / TR / speech synthesis / synthesis.dtd. who slept in my bed? asked Mum Bär. who slept in my bed? asked the Bärenkind.]] &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punctuation filters (SDB filters). this allows & ktons to start; faster with pre-reading, since only the first set has to be synthesized, not the entire text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">With the first start of & ktons, a set-limit detection filter is automatically set up. you can change its settings or add other set-limits recognition filters, but beginners will get discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to do this is to check the selection of speakers by trying out. switch on the selection of speakers and select text to read. check the selection of the speakers, change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed. of course, you have to have more than one speaker installed, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktons; then you can start reading faster, since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take a long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can pause or cancel text orders on the index card, even if the speech synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up if you start fractsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Syntax Filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and insert a tab character (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tabulator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard set limiter filter retains the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (kbps), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set of tabs, you can re-paste it by loading the contained file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the Speaker Selection menu, you can override the Speaker settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the card spokesman). in other words: no speaker properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable speaker with all the features of an established speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktons; otherwise select & ktons; the speaker that is most likely to match the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the speaker you want. if this property does not matter, don't enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property is to have precedence over other properties. you can also set multiple marks here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as the primary property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case where you may wish to provide the language attribute is when you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than that of the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all properties in the speaker area, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the default speaker drop button and then use on a speaker similar to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (no order number is required to enter 0).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr clicks immediately when it is started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get back tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktons; you probably have to register GStreamer. with GStreamer 0.8.x the command-register-0.8 is. if the problem is not solved, you may have a non-compatible version of GStreamer installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output over ALSA does not work when I play music with another application at the same time. if I receive a text order, freezes & ktons; one. on the & Console; appears a message stating: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system there is a problem that conflicts occur at ALSA which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. for possible solutions, see the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have added an additional voice for the festival from the Internet. I have installed it and can use it in the festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice to the file $KDEHOME / share / sectsd / Voengraint / Voengraint / Voengraint / VoIP. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice to the developer.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and can be found via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizermoduls such as festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed on the card board for speakers. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktons; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSml;) or, if you're very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -by-SSml converter-filter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't create websites with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but & ktons; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta the day Sable GENDER doesn't seem to work. so that festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file rejects the GENDER-Tags for converting from SSml to Saber. the same also applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added an own character cassette replacement filter and now I can go in & ktons; no more substitute for it or go back. on the tab orders is displayed, the order is only one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You are not allowed to filter punctuation marks (dot, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon). instead, use a filter for the set limit detection.</seg>
<seg id="2757">Alsa (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). Alsa is installed on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the modules are registered for GStreamer by calling the command-register before using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience conflicts with the audio output in connection with ALSA. if your system is also part of it, you can't play music at the same time and read a text. & ktons; also freezes if you stop a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the ALSA (dmix) website.</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode still does not support real breaks. if you stop a text order in & ktons, the current set will be read yet.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for the general setting of the speech speed but is otherwise not mandatory. Debian users can install sox using the apt-get install sox command. the program is already included on most & Linux; CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">Have you downloaded & ktons; as a tarball (with tar packed archive), log in as a normal user and unzip the tarball into a matching folder. switch to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 the module & arts; probably removed or at least only on request created.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have run time dependency of non-free software.

<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and there are several voices and languages supported. for many voices you can adjust volume, speech speed and pitch with & ktons.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You will need to install at least one language. help will be found in the instructions provided with festival. if you want to read web pages, you need to install the (male UK) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice presupposes festival 1.95 beta or newer. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unzip the software in festival / lib / resume / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices you need to enter for the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8 bit-) encoding for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech language, the coding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to an 8-bit Cyrillic, such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; then Festival takes over lexical analysis and & MBROLA; generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; program and the & MBROLA; voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; not a complete voice output system. & MBROLA; generates language from Diphone files. you need additional software to create this Diphone. festival produces these from & MBROLA; required diphone.txt2pho can also generate from German texts diphone. more information can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="2778">With this procedure additional wrapper code is added to festival to use & MBROLA; voice voices for voice synthesis. note that the & MBROLA; voice files are not installed in & MBROLA, but in the Folder Festival / lib /. instructions can be found at:</seg>

<seg id="2787">Festival Lite is a free, open source voice synthesizer which currently supports only a limited number of voices and languages. it is a simple voice synthesizer with even sufficient voice quality. with & ktons; you can adjust neither pitch, volume or speech speed with this speech synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Flite is usually included in the & Linux distributions, so search Flite first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Hadifix is a two-stage voice synthesizer working with diphons. the txt2pho program translates text into Diphone and the & MBROLA; voice synthesis is good, but the support is currently limited to few languages. you can adjust voice, pitch, speech speed and volume via kttsmgr.</seg>
<seg id="2790">Load at least one German language file from the & MBROLA, and unzip it to the / usr / local / MBROLA file.</seg>
<seg id="2791">Either copy txt2phorc to ~ / .txt2phorc or to / etc / txt2pho, here the rc must be removed at the end of the filename.</seg>

<seg id="2793">EPOS is a free, open source voice synthesizer for the Czech and Slovak language.It is a simple voice synthesizer with sufficient voice quality. with & ktons; you can only adjust the volume with this speech synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Start kttmsgr. on the card spokesman click Add. select the Czech or Slovak language and Epos TTS voice synthesizer. if the Epos programs are not in your PATH, enter the path to the programs on the card Speaker. in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs. enter in a & Console; epos -h or say -h to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="2795">FreeTTS is a free, open source voice synthesizer written in & Java; i.e. you need to install the & Java; Virtual Machine on your system. with & Java; can adjust neither pitch, volume or speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2796">The command module allows you to use & ktons; with any language synthesizer that can be controlled in a console; on the command line.</seg>
<seg id="2797">Best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file (wav) instead of sending output directly to the audio device</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetwork.conf, a module for the & kcontrolcentre; allowing network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcentre; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcentre; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcentre; the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings are displayed in the & kcontrolcentre; the network settings module (knetwork.conf;) can be started by selecting the kcontrolcentre; Internet & network network settings in the & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware may not install. physical devices and their drivers must have already been installed and configured to enable & knetworkconf to display the device at all and enable setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed when installing & Linux; installed and set up. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the network settings option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; when starting the module network settings, this attempt to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list that best meets the distribution and release date. by marking the setting non-re-questions the definition can be made permanently. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will be automatically preset.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously all options gray are shown, which means the settings can only be considered, changing is not possible. in system management mode, you can enter system management mode at the right lower end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the whole functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Network Interface tab is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed from the Network Interfaces tab:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface... in the Device Dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking the button Extended Settings shows the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">Automatic mode retrieves the TCP / IP settings from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP or BOOTP server automatically sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further setup is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be done without DHCP or BOOTP. the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the console, you can determine if the address you want is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switching off an switched-off network device will be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switching off an activated network device will be deactivated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Defines the IP address of the host in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located has to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the appropriate IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the host is requesting http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will invoke this name in an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Entries can be added, removed or changed. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS entries can be added to priority by selecting an entry or downgrading in the list with buttons additions or downgrading.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group machine to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group machine to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will display dialog Edit.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of knowingly known hosts describes hostname-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used when booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list of knowingly known hosts contains some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still existing version of IP is to replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add.... Add New Alias dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button. if the known machine has several Alias names, press the button Add multiple times and enter the other alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a particular known machine from the list and select Edit.... The dialog friend machine will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network Settings module are not effective immediately in the system. to enable the changes, the following command must be set in a console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. simply download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde does not suffice, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only by experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile and / or compile the following commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given about basic networking technology, in the second section all of & knetworkconf will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been widely used. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; Workplace the network administrator is the contact point of a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be arbitrarily chosen!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a dedicated area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are usually used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for specific things, eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The net address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine. normally the address is assigned 127.0.0.1 of its own loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section are the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it is not surprising if there is another content than specified in case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is dropped by the scripts in SuSE config. a different stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which additionally offered the ability of dds2tar to fast, selective unpacking. the second aim was to answer a question that asked my wife: how much longer does it take if you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a strap can be used, it must be incorporated by & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; restrain the band and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognize & kdat; don't recognize the band on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; looking for the right index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything goes smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the band has been included. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by flapping the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the strap, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; can be seen through a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been resolved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to save data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat; if your tape drive assumes that a tape can be formatted before use. floppy tape drives usually require formatting of the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacitance, & kdat; continue with the format of the tape. all data on the tape are lost! after completing the formatting process, the tape is automatically included and ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a safety profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and choose File...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is started, the dialog box opens up for backup. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the Backup dialog appears. the dialog displays the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in any of the archives and select the menu item Check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the checkout process is started, the dialog box appears for verification. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for verification.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for verification, the dialog appears to be reviewed. this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can reconnect, the files to be recovered must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore in the Restore menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process is started, the dialog box appears for recovery. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Once you have confirmed the settings for the restore, the dialog appears to restore. this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the band index file by means of the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can recreate the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a safety profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup is to take place. the list of files to be secured is updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files on the same file system are backed up, such as the folder. folders located on other file systems can be stored separately under backup files. each entry is considered tar-independent from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variant of the belt device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmits & kdat; before the tape is integrated, the command mt load to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be done.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, & kdat is trying to lock the ejection of the tape drive. it may not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, the tape will be disconnected; automatically discarded the tape. do not use this option with Floppy Streamers.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a system log; the program is intended for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files. moreover, the system allows for quick access, for example, to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">& ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access, for example, to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; hence, try to provide some advanced features, using the protocol files of certain programs to be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog, functions are provided with which the individual protocol rows of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; first the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will open. if you do not see them, and it opens instead of a small message window, you have & ksystemlog; most probably not with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in folder / var / log, for normal users normally do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or according to input strings. the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically, so that only log lines will appear next to the filter. in the default setting, a log line will only be displayed when the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">Of course, you can also select another entry at this point. for example, in the protocol file system protocol, select the column process, and in addition in the filter bar, select the name of a process, and you will show you & ksystemlog; all protocol rows that were sent and / or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol rows. protocol rows of the level errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color than protocol rows of the level indication. the colored display of protocol rows can be disabled alignment dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to view only a particular process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can use the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a particular command, such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the option to skip to new lines in the main window's context menu to view all the new protocol rows.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. you will find more current information on the Sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; find the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">System V Init quickly becomes the standard for controlling the program start when running the system in the & Linux; world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD init, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole bunch of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to boot when you run the system or when switching to another Runtime. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most of the systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a serial port in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default running level is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default set is 3. if you want to change this, then you can change / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful if you have messed up the inittab changes.</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no proper files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does init start and stop system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if one contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be invoked with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; have a server running level that only runs httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; I could also have a user-run level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say trivial: just drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six Running levels to start (or stop it) at this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between the runlevel or alter the position within a level by removing it somewhere else. the entry is removed from its original Running (or its position). this will only happen if you extract an entry from the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you move them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new Runtime, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the contextual menu and insert in the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the number numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (Available system services, Runtime 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runtime, move it to the clipboard by cutting it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sort number or name of an entry manually, press the input key to change the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / ksysvrc. Preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they will be recovered by & ksysv; changes to presets will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runlevel and now the machine starts constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the entry button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use another distribution, please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply exit with no news if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; Runtime varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must save them. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar, or save the entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. for editing, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog User and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards will only be displayed if you have extended system settings. only if you have limited space limitations (quota) for users will create a map card on which you can make individual settings. more flashcards will appear if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The register card password management appears, if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD -Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized for at least one filesystem space limitation (recognizable by the file quotas user / quotas group on the filesystem). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with limited space limitations in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected using the field file system with limited space limitation</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map groups inform groups about the group affiliations of the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click on the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group will work analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and modify the boot password, change the time to boot of the standard operating system, add, remove, modify operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
