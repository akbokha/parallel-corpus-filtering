although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , I danced to American music , read American writers and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
at the age of 14 , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , revealed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was like it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I had even written a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tru@@ mp arrived .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressing it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ al@@ is@@ mus@@ cul@@ Program , which records people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
the Tru@@ mp Welt@@ anschau@@ ung did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at play .
Tru@@ mp In@@ tolerance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot during my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp arrived on his way to the nomin@@ ee Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , gave the presi@@ dency to a man despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , indicating an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t for those who look differently from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( Anne@@ x D . : as much as &quot; rebellion of the white against all other ethnic groups &quot; ; white and Whi@@ pl@@ ash &apos;s word game in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash which meant so much like trauma ) , as the big Van Jones called it has killed just that which America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may always have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
however , with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp , a huge part of the White America promises this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd was ro@@ aring . &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son fell , sent him a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Tru@@ mp Land now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could no longer find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

out of the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the garbage
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , just 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has played in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults who has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become central to the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote on this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare smile .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they get out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you are always smiling and playing with shiny eyes and playing in the hu@@ stle and bu@@ stle you will learn day after day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music out of rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is located at the top of the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments made from local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to transform pieces of decay into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all of which were produced from the garbage .
the repertoire encompasses classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article published by the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the initial period :
at first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage . the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something he had never seen before : a tr@@ ash produced from waste .
today , there is an entire orchestra playing instruments from recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Wa@@ ste Shi@@ p ) records the musical performance :
every year , the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish .
those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - as the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can combat illegal fishing successfully
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that targets international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were therefore upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal offen@@ der of this type on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles rapidly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that simply refused to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million in Liberia , because of the lo@@ oting of the fish stocks in the country .
the core of this initiative to cross criminal practices and protect resources was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) in 2012 .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that then expelled the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded people and work together . they exchange information and stand up for illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . this makes illegal fishing a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by intentionally ignor@@ ing existing laws through which certain habitats and habitats should be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once imp@@ eded by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the s@@ nail emp@@ o , with information between individual countries cur@@ tail@@ ed , the actions now happen in real time , with trace@@ ability at F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
the individual countries can , for example , exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea , via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships fishing in forbidden areas . such suspi@@ cious lanes can also be discovered , such as those who suggest that a ship loads its captured fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the move and possibly also whether they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated $ 20 million lost in lost revenue , which lost eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishermen entering east African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which is why the region attracts commercially f@@ ishers from all over the world . among them illegal fishermen .
their practices include activities such as coast@@ ing under false flag , bog@@ us license papers , fancy names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ gap @-@ organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
until now , the closed front has been working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to its co @-@ operation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international body to combat crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can divide and receive information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps det@@ ecting the illegal ships that are happy to hide .
&quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and we try to cross it , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , for example , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
the aim of Cop@@ eland is to build a system that combines different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminals with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
Sky@@ Truth has recently opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Protection Agency : a platform that provides satellite data and displays the position of each individual track@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what &apos;s right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and consoli@@ date their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the pursuit of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only det@@ ecting criminals but also deter@@ ring them .
ships which formerly f@@ ished without a license and had hardly had any consequences , know now that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have meanwhile recorded a 33 % increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats purchase more lic@@ ences .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there six countries have joined together in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety , the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia had its first big triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was travelling under false flag . and not only was the ship on the way without a license and were used tra@@ w@@ l nets , which are now banned .
the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters which were reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they used a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing , &quot; said Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the world ocean . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ ture the country &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the deportation of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela had rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness , re@@ acted by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the refund of Venezuela ) , both images of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central @-@ north federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continues to deterior@@ ate continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the removal of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ arises the context of the government decision in its latest article as follows :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence rate belong to the highest ones around the world ( the inflation rate is estimated to 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching shortage of food and medicine is the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( e.g. : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces . in addition , a twelve hour strike on the following day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government presi@@ dency , should continue to exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike , and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .

the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26th .
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify , among other things , an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , images that talk about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of oppression and ill @-@ treatment , are accum@@ ulating on Twitter .
particularly large waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own testimony .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic is already making the rounds off the scale of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for an office building procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the street .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your removal !
on the street !
others consider these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which , from its point of view , has done little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and has preferred to om@@ it critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported that they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than work or go shopping .

when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in Cór@@ doba &apos;s Argentina .
as now grown up , Qui@@ j@@ ano has now testified in the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba against his father .
the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 for crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept family secrets .
in the situation at that time , I thought it was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not realize that one is being manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was the deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Per@@ la prison until 1978 .

however , this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who was accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who over the years recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
everyone named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you are friends with one of the ERP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pass only that they don &apos;t kid@@ nap you one day and then I must save you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian working class .
so he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be en@@ vious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because so my father had educated me .
at the military base , I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : University degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

over there the prisoners are tortured
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - simply everything possible - stood .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great lum@@ ps of silver .
that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were turned off and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
over there the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went in and saw a couch being tortured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal feathers .
later I found out that they attached to it one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person lying there .
they seldom stab@@ bed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , dren@@ ched it with water and ch@@ ased him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .
photo : Com@@ isi@@ ón Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the sten@@ ch there was horrible ... like a dirty no@@ bility .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this od@@ our .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a man can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were tied and tied .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian also accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked persons were lying down with the face - all were bound to hands and feet .
close to the entrance , people looked quiet on the matt@@ resses .
when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you approach me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told her at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were several rooms designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put a man together there and killed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors , the civilian contractor , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came here is also the way you came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be la@@ yed .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father brought all sorts of stolen things home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war yield is a bay@@ on@@ et , or perhaps military rab@@ bits , which one takes away from an enemy that one has fought .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then that is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the Gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a criminal and I replied : and you who steal cars on the street ?
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded in rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
that was my father .
I have no good memory of him .
when I testified in the trial , I showed a photograph of that time on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still got clothes with home .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can burden me what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ the enforced disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and recognizes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you were exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship . but why did the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why kid@@ nap children ?
one day , my father brought a girl home whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I repeatedly asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could have been put in jail .
I guess it was just decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families , whom one could hand over their mortal remains ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the enforced disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act that one can do to a human being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something is , of course , always .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thought of showing my father was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly disgu@@ sted and asked myself why the entire exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they were supposed to defend , were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and forced me as a child to take part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I issued the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can repro@@ ach me that I am bi@@ ased . I have finally spoken out against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 counts : including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly serious cases , torture followed by death in five cases , and a case of kidn@@ apping of a under 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .

the sentences in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended in August 1975 and December 1978 committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
in 28 cases , the courts were sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences ranging between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ yment : murder , Tor@@ ture and rape by officials .
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian personnel .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was ab@@ duc@@ ted with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he directed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human bra@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who worked for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization founded in 1995 , H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted for more than three years , but the research for this lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driving license .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving license , were witnesses to a very successful translation last month .
on a shield , the Japanese word , the &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; means , fal@@ sely - perhaps also with malicious thought and # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1st to September 20th .
adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the fact that the local newspapers drew attention to it .
the paper Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which appears in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t for older people and in an international city as Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incorrect English translation was first removed . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , though gramm@@ atically correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the ap@@ ologies as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast news was a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; has been den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved nationwide in accidents is a cause of concern .
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 cases of sen@@ iors were caused . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors generated 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the non @-@ named journalist brought comments to light , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently have against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo , on the translation error , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is it a reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So fla@@ wed is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and to use active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers .
a French native speaker should , for example , translate from English into French - not from the French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ searching , or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have a foreign staff , can still produce translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese colleague , whose English knowledge is assessed as the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the conf@@ using and en@@ ig@@ matic pro@@ positions created by machine translations show that this technology cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
in the future , the Kyoto City will hopefully use a more rep@@ utable source for its translations .
Venezuela : take protests and cens@@ orship measures on Internet and television
main page of the website Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet sites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible .
other online tran@@ smit@@ ters carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organised by opposition groups opposing the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and the Parliament &apos;s duties on the executive and the Supreme Court itself had committed itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was coupled and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ it : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages are again blocked by Venezu@@ el@@ an providers .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offerings such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in periods of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw it as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I signed up at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
it is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ symph@@ in@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible through a locking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online tran@@ smit@@ ters .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique through which the DNS server will answer requests for certain domains .
when an Internet site is blocked by the DNS , the server responds poorly or den@@ ies the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS block : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was shut down on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to the show .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates the internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans more difficult to access multimedia reporting about current events in the country .
in Paraguay a lot of girls become slaves in order to receive education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ adi@@ ta who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by a structural company , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind approval of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lowing C@@ ows , deca@@ ying schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation from university she returned to the house once more and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the one from which has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls , who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes over their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , an education and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that children have to spend countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be done - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice , called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that gets vacc@@ inated on the cri@@ p@@ ta guarantees in general silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , the family that puts their daughter in the faith that they can complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; can pass over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes the girl with him and justi@@ fies its exploitation by believing that they give someone a chance that otherwise would not receive education and might even be star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn from it only a few years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent pun@@ ches . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was in the budget of the former military officer Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ e@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra reached Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered le@@ thal injuries .
this was to be the final punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela bl@@ amed the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , deeply rooted in Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest r@@ allies and demanded that there be &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; more cows are registered in Paraguay as children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the couple &apos;s neighbours and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for prompt investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ e@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ays a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go arrives in court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ ta are not only exploited as labour forces ; they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to bank@@ rupt and her father lost his job .
their brothers now had to go to work and began to sell candy on the streets or on the market in order to earn money .
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she stood up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employers .
Fri@@ days , for example , clean@@ sed the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home and had time to learn .
the sooner it was finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she didn &apos;t have any food in@@ definitely . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the house library as food out of the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 .
at some evenings the owner Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and to read an editorial in opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; the master had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they thought I would &quot; learn &quot; bad habits there again . &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would again speak to Guar@@ ani &apos;s native language at home .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made available to her , she explains .
she was , however , fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that almost never is spoken is mo@@ bbing and har@@ ass@@ ment exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ lla when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to come home . I had no friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I didn &apos;t belong to any group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group showing job advertisements for cleaning staff and n@@ anni@@ es in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a five year old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third commentary was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the signing of the ad turned out once again :
dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thank you very much , I write again when something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue of the report Cri@@ adi@@ ta , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ ta , how long ago ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ ta , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paragu@@ ays ) , the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í and their &quot; wives . &quot;
social inequality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill proposes to Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulation on the use and usage of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is adopted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up that is t@@ asked to authori@@ ze citizens to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it may result in a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ es in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video alignment and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration . it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad@@ Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ler , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of that it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network .
but it has not been known so far that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techni@@ ologist at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control physically public and private spaces it could also be done online .
when I take them seriously , it means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to feed them into a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , whose senses will maximize control and ensure that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was intended for those found guilty of men@@ ac@@ ing &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rescue worker H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Per@@ si@@ can le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which fight through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) .
why is this particular le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem will also depend on a large predat@@ or .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video concludes that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out pure joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is fond of a different side of her country , which is not just war and conflict .

early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress that has been achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a State Pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had let entire coastal cities disappear from the map .
in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture has seen an atomic accident , alone that &apos;s why 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view which progress six years after was reached to rebuild the lives of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese reconstruction and survey results of the suffer@@ ers themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( to be found in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate ) were completed by December 2015 .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 per cent of the planned sub@@ stitu@@ tions were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent represents the final light .
however , even six years after the disaster , ev@@ ac@@ uation of shelter dwell@@ ings ( to be found in the in @-@ chief , Kaz@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) must be reloc@@ ated to final shel@@ ters .
after the triple disaster , nearly 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by disaster have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of schools in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are back in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident were affected extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 per cent of its agricultural land , whereby only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farm@@ land can be re @-@ used in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear bor@@ der@@ land . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far off .
the tourist arri@@ vals in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal dwell@@ ers find it more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation ones . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and how her feeling has changed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ risk .
in its introduction to this article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o paper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ consciousness among the native population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed find that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done .
how it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also stepped up its attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only had to witness the huge earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture also witnessed the worst , disaster @-@ induced , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
from 160 000 people ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were res@@ ett@@ led into permanent plac@@ ements .
at the end of 2017 , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres in the disaster areas are older than 50 years old . they are known to fail because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when one meets people from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often notices that one connects more than it seems at first glance .
these global links are important because they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives , and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over voice and country boundaries .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a hike has strengthened their affection for Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa looks at the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after he was beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the Attack Against Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer had struck him against the head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
physicians operated on this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás conf@@ essed that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officer how he hits Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs are hur@@ rying shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus off the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian real rel@@ ays ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

the drawing was shared several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for more violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás has experienced a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , supported by the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group joined , only to crimin@@ alize teachers , and here we have a very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who has struck him with a stroke .
police ass@@ aults
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where there was brutal police action against prot@@ esters last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
polic@@ emen put in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
again , the Brazilian media covered street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo talked about a broken glass window in order to design their front pages illustr@@ atively with a photograph .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic ground to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage .
here , too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate importance , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot;
the Un@@ char@@ ted villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as the &quot; Central - Spanish Su@@ gar Mill , &quot; not@@ withstanding that there is no significant sugar crop on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after lying down , the sugar cane industry was still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the steel and concrete framework remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the job .
other res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier &apos;s veter@@ an who is standing up every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active period are back into operation because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administration decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for un@@ rest for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality saw even better times .

the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price climbed over a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the &quot; Agricultural Pro@@ sp@@ ects &quot; published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation .
if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
in front of the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
it was a matter of officially auth@@ ored documents which differ@@ ed only concerning the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could approve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was sur@@ passed and the letters came more and more frequently .
for two years , Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was in charge of the closed factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories which were yet in operation , &quot; he affir@@ med .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , awaits the retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was opposed to his will in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ station has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to the employment agencies and services that generated the facilities in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut speech of October 21 , 2002 , when he saw President in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories had not been in use for five years , everything would go well .
the cost of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane is only extracted high by grinding .

after two years the people commun@@ e Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to dis@@ miss it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without prospects for the future , many young people left the region .
a food factory has been created in the area , whose production is not even for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma plant , the ruins of the place where he began work .
nin@@ ety @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a post @-@ supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him .
they torture him for ten years .
N@@ ene is reti@@ ring at 65 years of age , not because he lacks power , but because he is bit@@ tered .

first Nations youngsters use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture
take a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do this via hip hop , thanks to a series of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshops lead mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop is making sure that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribal area of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia relates , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
most of the cases have not been clari@@ fied .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always master the languages of the First Nations .
in the song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available , as is a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the day when you will forgive our cry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have lost our way in life as a youth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and promote our youth as well .
so they can do what they determined the Creator
in the commentary section , the reader and advocate of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and is re@@ published here with permission ) :
plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant in Japan
plastic dishes ( to be found in the garden ) outside of a typical Japanese restaurant .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
in order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , they are displayed in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the in @-@ board , &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of every dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry devoted to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ky district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a large number of these small companies that produce plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usual that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend turns them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver mat@@ ome the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sales : new mobile tapes , decorated with plastic dishes , as shown at the Tok@@ y@@ u Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial food items have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few sho@@ ebo@@ x fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food reserves is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here &apos;s an apple that holds your mobile :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing departure into the comic .
some cell phone support and cell phone designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon sc@@ ammed is used , a popular t@@ opping , which is served with white rice .
some users had doubts on Twitter :
is there someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with laughing betra@@ y@@ als ? &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice .
there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands of dried salmon .
further bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly only appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely re@@ pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict .
the day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the congregations that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each body , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co created the digital project &quot; ap@@ portions a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; to live with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) which is to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were in the struggle between the law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organized crime lets us not only fear our lives .
the impact is much more profound .
for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ da que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changed &quot; ) tells precisely these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just a single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we are preparing again today for the task we have set ourselves to seek out and to search for graves after the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on the 15th of October he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment it does not have an income .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are the assurance of my Father , but it won &apos;t pay them because they demand a death certificate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
writers of &quot; render a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community conflicts , fra@@ gil@@ ity and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a teacher of Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it appears :
I have known disease and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
every day I pass newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues writing :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the perpetr@@ ators when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in statistics .
the in@@ tim@@ el@@ essness of the people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; rebel@@ li@@ ous . &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not moving and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main town district : &quot; how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; this describes how armed criminals were forced to squee@@ ze money out of their business for month until they destroyed not only the business but also torn their families apart .
you think of all that you have lost , and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes away , the trauma stops , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want others to be arrested , for they don &apos;t know when they will dec@@ eive you or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days if weeping would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence drawn generation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells us he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years earlier when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , which had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Om@@ bud@@ sman for Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office amounted to 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 kill@@ ings per day .
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and which inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever @-@ new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the &quot; ap@@ i a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co created the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this contribution and the pages to which he links , contain pictures depicting violence .
the fak@@ ing check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting up a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years after something first appeared ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release it has been mis@@ guided to illustrate trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false link between image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices , or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a tank car tra@@ vers@@ ed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , dump@@ ed and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths filled with po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to it .
officials described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a movie theatre nearby , which was full of people watching the FIFA World Cup .
houses scattered and char@@ ted cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to infin@@ ity .
a picture entitled &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from the I@@ gur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident train the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it shows rows of carb@@ oni@@ zed bodies lined up on the floor while people look at them .
but here history does not end .
over the years , the same photo was taken on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms several times , fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an settlements of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses drastically reported atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a person to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be depicted on the basis of satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the B@@ oko Har@@ am &apos;s attempt to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this impro@@ per use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ fu@@ sions ; Africa check has documented author@@ isations to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
even one step further , personal comment@@ aries , such as this example , mistakenly assume the image of the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to deliver arguments .
the image from S@@ ange has also appeared in connection with the fatal persecution of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning report , published by the United Nations , those who could flee were beaten , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which wrong@@ ly claimed Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an being , monks and politicians allegedly participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be viewed here .
other news organizations , called AF@@ P as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed to this statement , but had not linked the image of the DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these dec@@ eit@@ ful dec@@ ou@@ pling come back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can exceed limits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the mentioned image of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ on of private sites , social media platforms and common and national publications , and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed wrong reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have included examples of ab@@ u@@ sive usage and linked them to the respective countries based on what page they have been published on . by doing so , we want to show the reach more clearly than by language alone .
several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use can be derived from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also have been linked to each other ) .
here are some cases that can now be fully detected ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
country examples of false copies of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to sites or servers where examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false reports are still available .
the countries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available on Tin@@ Eye , probably also show fal@@ si@@ fication examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was shared as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of impro@@ per use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet , the sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to del@@ egi@@ timi@@ ze the asser@@ tions that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being used to abuse , as the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Myanmar government has published a right to judge what they considered &quot; deliberately in@@ toxic@@ ated news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings in Myanmar . &quot;
this judgment , which appeared exclusively in English , also includes references to counter@@ f@@ eit images of rum@@ ors operated by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to indicate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dissemin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims killing Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein made its 2012 claim that monks and politicians participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of che@@ ek .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the recently deleted news page An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar d@@ jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was put into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the paper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Congo turned up with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events , presum@@ ed in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the image was weather@@ ed as evidence of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to ho@@ ax .
from the embassy in which the image was included in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also indicates , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions on the silence associated with the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
but a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images .
with social media , there are ump@@ teen people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy .
does this mood of false and mis@@ information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the distribution of violent pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
one argument is that keeping images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves .
at the same time , there is a concern that violent pictures are des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers and taking the ability to emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media seem to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss regarding violent representations in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
technologi@@ sts experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used detached from the context or in a completely impro@@ per way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , each investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog un@@ v@@ eils the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog called un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( irre@@ plac@@ eable ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but everyone stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the T@@ amer@@ oom language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Take care of your parents in recognition of how they have ende@@ a@@ vor@@ ed you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ us@@ k language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
k@@ w@@ adi - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words about his blog about :
they def@@ y other cultures , reveal other ways of thought , and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ds the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in the decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually sets in at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya crossed the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to a statement from the disaster centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are missing because of floods and mu@@ d@@ holes .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe places of stay .
the ra@@ ins came down on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas decreased slowly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the scale of the floo@@ ding catastrophe :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . t@@ witter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many people use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly flight wor@@ sens the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after more rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was standing in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle was also flooded because of the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are completed to transport emergency supplies for the inhabitants locked in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also been able to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on the high water situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and vital goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the taxi call app Pick@@ me ( Sri Lanka ) asks for worried people to share their location data with the app so that the cat@@ ap@@ hor@@ a data centre will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call up a vehicle for picking assistance and donations . these were then transmitted free of charge to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button which resulted in more than 1,000 requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floods and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring security and help to residents in need .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now facing the long way up to the restoration of norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I confi@@ de in her my four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children . she is my rock in the surf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we call for the rights of women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next gu@@ ise , we have rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ scar@@ f , tied from an American flag , others sc@@ are slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination .
they were dis@@ armed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look the same .
we do differently to religion .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim category .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who like me don &apos;t fit into it , are dis@@ armed .
to be ab@@ u@@ ated
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this even happened to the poet , whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what kind of images do you have in mind when you think about it ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
the Islam , the Koran , and the Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day when he died .
but in the Western imagination , the religion of Rum@@ is was er@@ ased , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion constitutes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims that have been colonial books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear , and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ car@@ ded history behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to shift them .
I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I &apos;ve seen these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous narr@@ atives dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries over the past three decades , while the United States could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative is failing to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings , and Saudi Arabian , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exer@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave ships .
it cle@@ ars the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has cast our collective imagination such deep and er@@ ron@@ eous that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories that we tell and because of the way in which we tell them Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion people
in the news industry we do more than telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives which help us to understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to grasp the narrative of the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; religious group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

four decades ago , my immig@@ rant parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ lu@@ r Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan was re@@ viewing the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were absolutely Muslims and Americans .
but am I now inevitable Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my handy pocket basket that all Muslims wear - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I joke , we do not carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
we don &apos;t have to be a the@@ ological expert to be a Muslim or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim milit@@ ants and inter@@ religious activists who endeav@@ our to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ forged Islamic refin@@ ery machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information that our already faulty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , have manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility is more than just a stranger that tears the head@@ scar@@ f from a woman .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they rever@@ t to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps my friend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could see through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter when I saw her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arabic scrip@@ tures to the protection that seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim belief is always part of my shadow .

belonging is the picture of my mat@@ ernal grandmother with her sisters ; how they gain a competition from the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi three decades ago .
it is the image of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen captains , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be a Muslim means speaking the prayers she had told me when I had a bad day .
to be a Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who - for centuries - have been col@@ oni@@ zed by an &quot; Empire , &quot; which a company established with the name of Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Company , it has a profound significance to call God my only Lord .

affili@@ ation means growing up and hearing that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cries .
in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept desper@@ ately for his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , a family ruled by India , which he was not allowed to close in his arms in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be a Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed &quot; all the way to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dis@@ car@@ ded over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mir sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion , goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ mind@@ ful history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent , apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim is to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy visits the US and the suspect bears a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave .
it means knowing that a African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country two hundred years ago .
it means nam@@ ing Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded airports to fight against the Muslim ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties , which are provided with multiple ashes , but fail to communicate them to others .
the narrative of the 1.7 billion bears more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in reducing doubt &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people are building structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility consists of Muslim registr@@ ations that have started with President Bush and have been extended to President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we lead and the bombs we reject in Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply committed to sof@@ ten the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we come back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous pic@@ torial prints that we are ste@@ aling in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .

but I am concerned because of this difficult global timing in which we are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this moment has consequences beyond the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a reason why conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years before , it had not yet existed ; now , they control large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who today made me an essential Muslim .
things I &apos;ve left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
things that may aw@@ aken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made &quot; another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the Bridge in Berkeley , conversations take place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam hos@@ tility .

we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being aware and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; ; as it is my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation we have no president , while he already vom@@ ited countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art seeks to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the language diversity of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , there is a risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project , the following applies :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that assume diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to .
while &quot; listening frequently is connected to understanding , &quot; these events are instead &quot; listening to &quot; to appreciate , to make sense . &quot;
in this format , stories tell their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story @-@ t@@ eller , their devotion and their depic@@ tion lead to the fact that the audience sett@@ les on it .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language Daf@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ du@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ uch@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bits and the b@@ abo@@ on in Sh@@ ona , Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ uch@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened to !
they were alert ...
they were with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling .
Puerto Rico calls for re @-@ establishment of public debt by the United States
with the aim of a re@@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amount to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 . the march started with the Mexican Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens &apos;s Front for the Ne@@ ural Integration of Deb@@ t ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ establishment of debt also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts must be held accoun@@ table for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand a financial audit and a manag@@ erial committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding remuneration , which operates in favour of the economy .
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with falling rent reductions .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
measures imposed on the outside will risk without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration called the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open network .
this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which is held in Berlin , devoted itself to an event of the # Free@@ bass@@ le campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Director of Book S@@ prints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; produced books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Sur@@ gical Research ) .
the book published last year and available free of charge here contains a number of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it &apos;s a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction , it says :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what are the real costs associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and in order to create some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was removed from the A@@ dra prison &apos;s directory , where he lod@@ ged on October 3 , 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title of collective memory gives his friends and family a voice that push@@ es for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , right away .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in free culture , many of us have let us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and choices .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el was on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; commanded by the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who presented themselves as insi@@ der of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and conditions remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a decisive role in extending the access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry mort@@ g@@ ore , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Basel &apos;s cultural prototypes was more predic@@ tive than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influence .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would do everything possible to wipe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expe@@ dient in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el did not finish this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life in dre@@ aming of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bass@@ el told me English , even when he was already in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he gave me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ dig@@ y that she wrote in the years 2012 @-@ 2015 her husband when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated her from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book Cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is happening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose sight in the moment we embrace ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and watch@@ men
I forget the prison of prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
with passion with me ,
when your eyes bid farewell
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weeping and smiling at your absence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...

Basel &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the 2011 protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under force by the regime were tortured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in detention since 2011 according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we repeat our demand in the hope we have to do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moz@@ ambique : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of corruption , director of prison sentenced again to previous jobs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambique responded with anger to a corruption case where a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state machine where corruption was committed .
it concerns Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other defend@@ ants for the dis@@ sent@@ ing of 54 million Me@@ tics ( some 800 000 euros ) .
the money came from public funds of the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good management and immediately called for his re @-@ appointment to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the motion , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post , since the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not expect the action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , condemned the decision of the company to address the director again in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and under@@ lines the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in view of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary action against the ab@@ duc@@ tor .
the company apparently remained silent and did not make reasonable legal action for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case to be &quot; offensive &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would have been advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which served to eat .
he could give paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be integrated into the company which he helped to harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly pay for his silence .
re@@ vo@@ cable to you !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he was insul@@ ting him . I can &apos;t believe that someone was rewarded with such a massive insul@@ t to the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing to return to the state and serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served only himself by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state when it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison term .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remembered as the first independent president to the Moz@@ am@@ ans , but also as a sharp , inc@@ isi@@ ve and - by the way - proph@@ etic do@@ ers .
one of his most famous oral depic@@ tions was when he confirmed energe@@ tically that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that he is not . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is simultaneously criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also slo@@ ping :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat for 10 years and was free .
and today the company has signed a contract with which he may de@@ file money . # As@@ sim@@ v@@ ai@@ OM@@ NI@@ Pa@@ is - Ex@@ pos@@ al @-@ Secretary @-@ tier ( @ az@@ i _ Ra@@ fik ) , May 12 , 2017

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the known social network took their posts from the grid because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or the &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma within the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word in itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they discussed the use of the word or doubts expressed in order to use the word have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written in Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Spi@@ der b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ky A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a play .
the ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before releasing all posts that would be suspected of spreading racism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on Fac@@ e@@ ook .
what you should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who dissemin@@ ate hate speech will receive fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise her nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who distribute hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have demonstrated that the cens@@ orship of cat@@ ch@@ words often becomes a cat and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post office &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a lot of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they did this without local context or technical support , and banned words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inher@@ it@@ cur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ sely deleted posts .
if they had a little bit more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a great deal of sales , that would be great .
Facebook Auto cens@@ orship has provided users with a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the web .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts which didn &apos;t contain hate speech , but still removed :

over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should also heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area Rak@@ h@@ ine , where clas@@ hes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control h@@ ein@@ ous hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context rather than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago ends with the marriage

the marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice so that the age of marriage is now 18 .
in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organisation ( IR@@ O ) , a group representing the representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
this is not@@ withstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contracting party of the UN child rights convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; defined every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married to 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 to 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that ende@@ a@@ vor@@ ed to prevent children &apos;s age followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this outcome .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition led to tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there were doubts whether the opposition would agree to the bill in general .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the birth of children - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided at the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and not one single .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after it was decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws for children &apos;s marriage were finally changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who we@@ ars a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk disgu@@ ised at the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price .
while Abel was the opinion , it took a long time to complete the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ ent@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ alis - Thomas , which states : , Excell@@ ent news !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law has been decided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ly Mut@@ ota , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke openly about the importance of adop@@ ting the law , said :
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years , regardless of the religious affili@@ ation .
the draft amend@@ ment has been adopted today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 MPs in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties who were against have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a long fight ( ... ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many thanks to all the activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed and he seems to release his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al Ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished they would address the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Vor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
rather than talking about the problem , instead of talking about the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem , would simply talk about the fact that the state , our daughters , protects them from being mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are opposed to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children &apos;s marriage is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .
hack@@ ers sc@@ are the office of the prosec@@ utor in front of national protests in the Russian National Day
screen print of the message posted on Sunday early on the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s website of the Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l district .
on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption that coinci@@ ded with Russia &apos;s Day - the Russian National Day - the website of the prosec@@ utor of the district Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l was hack@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or we will put you in jail instead of Dim@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hack@@ ers posted the YouTube video &quot; He is not Dim@@ on for you &quot; on the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website with the following comment : &quot; the Office of the prosec@@ utor calls the citizens not to follow the pro@@ voc@@ ations and keep away from all non @-@ sanc@@ tioned events ! &quot;
at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the site - but it remained in the cache .

on Sunday , the Office of the Prosecutor announced the local news agency Y@@ ar@@ News that they were hack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia contents again
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has locked the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series oppose the blocking .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked web pages ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third biggest VPN @-@ pre@@ valence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking an article from Wikipedia such as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular blocking of the Internet has been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No 5@@ 56 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second best @-@ known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
one solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available , despite legal restrictions .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed mode .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was done independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is just screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock .
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedia , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ Page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as collabor@@ ators at Moz@@ illa at the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
you access a different URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server further direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia , even if it is locked in Turkey .
because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature protection .
a Su@@ h@@ len@@ der N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never happy with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with badly positioned motives and washed colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when I suddenly called me Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he was already standing by face to face to the face of the face :
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ wei@@ k appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at him and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could take pictures of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands

this post was auth@@ ored by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was re@@ published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid pron@@ oun@@ cing the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that because of the social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by a mock trial from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married couple with names .
the tradition not to name their wives also by name is common among men . however , they have far fewer rights to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the little village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une County , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health staff and house@@ wives , stood by a unique club and became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of the 56 clubs there are in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and sets up for the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children &apos;s treas@@ on up to the exile of HIV and AIDS victims , and manages this club .
she tells us how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors for change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion round was about women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they have been du@@ tiful and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition att@@ ests that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made any thought until this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try at home as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned around and said I should call him from now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can name us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shouldn &apos;t it be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women should never speak out the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she only smoked in front of herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to let the whole fru@@ stration come out against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on her faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ aline rush of having broken with an old custom , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation took place in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zin@@ ced red dot on the forehead that indicates the mar@@ ital status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ ced red point if he did it also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not stopped altogether , but think they are now in a better position , even to choose to not wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place to exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually we pack lun@@ ches and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry , who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they are .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have only carried out sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ine Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare .
after a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of their own coat @-@ election , the morality associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of tas ( top shirts ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them .
next they decided to make a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it .
on the question of whether something has changed since the first discussion club in the five months , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far , we have only done small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped saying the name of their husband .
some , including me , do it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead at any time .
the women in the disc@@ us club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as the hag@@ gling over more freedom of movement or the choice of clothing - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
as Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commem@@ oration day
the Beat@@ les during their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the Beat@@ les &apos; official YouTube channel .
on June 29th of this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag has been to be found in the jap@@ an@@ ese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the Beat@@ les visit in Japan in 1966 is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noticed in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to make the Japanese run through .
the people here soon became aware that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today the Beat@@ les Memorial Day is in Japan . they have been here in Tokyo for 51 years .
still today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survi@@ ves everything .
today is the day of the Beat@@ les .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places associated with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York Memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be qu@@ ir@@ ky enough :
good morning together .
today is the day of the Beat@@ les .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and walked over Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
and of course , some companies also use the fan community in terms of market research , such as this R@@ amen shop ( Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
and what could it be for a day ?

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men in Moz@@ ambique could be the target of attacks .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ traffi@@ cking , presumably for ab@@ u@@ sive purposes , is disturbing the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conf@@ essed that the organs of Sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are being used .
there are local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC declared .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the target of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN carried out a mission in the South African country in 2016 to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
attention to c@@ ah@@ le males who travel to Moz@@ ambique are the target of ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an police after the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the area where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ b@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for probably abnormal Ritu@@ als , has cultural motifs and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of B@@ log@@ gers poor S@@ nai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the major social difficulty that Moz@@ ambique is faced with :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Moz@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME ashamed A country in which the people would be ashamed to demand sex against good marks , and would even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which men would be hun@@ ted or bald or bald for ab@@ u@@ sive uses or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humour .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , and also the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald :

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our heart@@ felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , friends and all those who knew him and loved him .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) plays a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our Arab blo@@ gger in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and Constitution were unknown until today ( August 1 , 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we honor Bass@@ el &apos;s work as a pioneer of the open web movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations that have been campaig@@ ning for his release in the last five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly displaced by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custody , according to Am@@ nesty International &apos;s international human rights organisation .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state ) , having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Li@@ u &apos;s case as an &quot; an internal affair , &quot; and a spokes@@ man told that he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
however , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel Peace Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some foreign reactions .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway , Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Bren@@ de have refused to answer questions about the release of Li@@ us .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a stand@@ still after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government told that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed until December last year . Norway signed an agreement only in June to resume the salmon business to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up its prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top @-@ ranking diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ u as she announced in a statement on 30 June :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we at the same time expect China to lift up all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should meet and receive all visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad announced that the Americans &quot; wish him the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as he can help him recover . &quot;
a spokesperson for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the Embassy asks the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
the request of the US Embassy drew a fur@@ ious reply from China , with the statement of the State Department that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and have ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told the couple that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which it claims according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations .
the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .

German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hoping that Li@@ u &quot; receives all the medical support he needs , &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping published on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing &apos;s news agency Reu@@ ters said that China had great concerns about whether the fuss about Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit in Hamburg .
Canada , Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P beforehand that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to say :
Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release those rights campaig@@ ned for the exercise of these rights .
France , France
France &apos;s foreign ministry requested China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments it needs , regardless of where it is needed . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will ultimately receive it .
Taiwan cover in Taiwan
the Council of Continental Affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and to show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 , and announced that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and which he was severely punished had led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be regarded as a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the state New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city .
... nobody asked if New York was a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o blog acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in the face of this , he appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
it has , on the other hand , defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re pop@@ s up from author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , aband@@ oning the distorted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end , in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , the responses to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really were not answers .
he was able to answer corresponding questions with non @-@ responses of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our inexpensive K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point if it was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference to better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
please read the address .
when he said Singapore is more of a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ even , even if we enjoy free and fair elections .
he compared Singapore to cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
when he said that Singapore was not a country , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense !
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam who , as the leader of an advancing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the minister of justice said in Singapore ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of Singapore political leaders , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it , and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam has committed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good faith a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian @-@ speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , to which country are the sovereign rights of the city Singapur back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of grave importance .
why do the people of Singapur afford their military service , do they defend only their city but not their country ?
who does our prime minister have to pay back bills ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade tends to be Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and was always a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t tell what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapur ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; defence of the country in particular , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct .
we should speak more about the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global Vo@@ ices recently asked its editors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , revealing ru@@ mo@@ urs of certain parts of the world and showing a different fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , Editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question most posed to me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I then reply . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan .
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in its inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication is usually followed by the default answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook in anger , if they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know it , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they &apos;re traveling .
everyone loves Canadi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
so it was already when I began traveling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be considered the most tolerant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends that I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if one would change me with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the punch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : to be called &quot; nice &quot; means to be idle - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle yet tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
to be harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not worthy of attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main characteristic of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band celebrated in Thailand has released a music video released by the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the prec@@ ep@@ ts of his girlfriend .
although not specifically politically , the music video relates indirectly to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video posted on Facebook was shared 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular how it beha@@ ves in the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video that refers to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives absolute discretion to the supreme commander of the army about important national issues .
the 11th Ru@@ le : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; changing the attitude &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics of the jun@@ ta .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army which monitors online content and people accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy is prosec@@ uted .
Thailand uses a strict sec@@ rec@@ y against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ esty &apos;s offensive ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was declared in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax@@ pa@@ yers .
in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .

the post @-@ war society is re@@ covering very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , above all in the district of T@@ ku@@ cum@@ al .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war has officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ sign@@ ava are located in the coal basins of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , Asia Min@@ or , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ cum@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has amounted to 16@@ ,000 , having barely climbed over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

at the entrance of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha village I met a native elder man .
he begins a conversation and it is hard for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why are you talking ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is nonetheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded gran@@ deur buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ow@@ kas , which still accommodate one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where linen is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a ruined house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately pull back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to be photographed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the ruined building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as livestock farming , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable growing .
it is difficult to get over the laps .
the district administration offers candles and bread to the villages in winter free of charge .

about ten years ago an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter living in France Gal@@ ina did not leave before Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay in Asia forever , &quot; she says .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not have a vegetable garden or house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other villa@@ gers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if holidays are , we will visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do it all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could cultivate cour@@ get@@ tes .
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day , it reminds of the village life before the war .
in spite of their relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently we bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha will receive approximately $ 9 pa@@ edi@@ atric money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has her own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once was , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that it was initially a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has more to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day how the city and war once were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as our conversation comes to an end , a little boy is running past us .
it runs through the window of a ruined building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling the hill .
a group of children now scre@@ aming the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which provide im@@ mortality in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it otherwise .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Afrika &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and golden earrings in ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for approximately 2.@@ 50 dollars the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , people come in full mini@@ bus and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some also slept outside on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill , they buy them drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with their daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a mou@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to be able to go to Boston .
Foto : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel very comfortable here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
the family had heard about other companions from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy grew weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will get in touch with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they have gone to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
it declares that their Christian faith is the driving force of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chickens like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family welcomed migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
he began to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for a dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a stove outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula arrive from central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and a stranger , a single mother , offered him her roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next steps .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , the travellers quietly consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about her house full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother , she smoo@@ thes in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with afri@@ can hair care , which she made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , young and old .
she laughs sadly , while she puts her in front of me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a point @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users received a mobile notification in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city of U@@ rum@@ qi , in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Clean &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police reported that the app would investigate and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; damaging information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a security service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic sites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network .
this app with the min@@ ors for min@@ ors is meant to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
of course , an app with these functions can be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications on digital cens@@ orship in China focus mostly on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often dark for those who live in distant , afflicted ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( which was published on Twitter ) , the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police inspec@@ tors checked the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately if they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification called for people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered by a check@@ point with a device without this software , you could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have forced people to use appliances that are intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest control technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
it also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which it appears that the software can lift up the key requirement of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and affiliated institutions , including universities and research institutions , are required to follow the cy@@ ber security office instructions when operating their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of U@@ rum@@ qu@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and grants them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cries after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything van@@ ishes .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible both from within and from outside .
one that gives honour to their name .
one that has set itself down in a list of feelings and expressions that don &apos;t allow metaph@@ ors .
but when reality re@@ covers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death .
all doubts dissolve in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the Earth continues on the axis of the evil . you realize that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , have built stone around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; cries .
all districts sought after , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not put high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a little cal@@ ming after the power supply stopped functioning in the quarter .
I broke the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to gather .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a glorious picture that fully met my expectations .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet in the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid down .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed them all the way up to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me also hear you scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you are only brave enough to sh@@ out if we are not in the vicinity . &quot;
his eyes filled me with hat@@ ching eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the floor ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest chat that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement and his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this accur@@ sed sentence is still in my nose to this day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a psychological torture that I had been exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I put all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they gave me a larger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one other prisoner and must immediately set me without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ time communication method : with the fist to beat against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ ä@@ ft@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the Doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no striking features can be seen in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
maybe he was moved to one of the big cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
Li@@ gner .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to chase away all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ oured on the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance I still hear her scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries ert@@ ank , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that Schwarz was the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented to us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; allu@@ rement to the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this revealed the secret : to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the betra@@ yer and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close view of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a land here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter into the interro@@ gation room and meet at Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he happens to me .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite his facial expressions that gli@@ de to him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important thing with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I can no longer tell exactly when insul@@ ts and blows have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to deserve this punishment .
a penalty in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls this loving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ cks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er suddenly rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure with him , and you can &apos;t with@@ hold your cries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my cries didn &apos;t give him enough reason why they exchanged the tube with a cable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at my first arrest I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator used to work as a garbage collector earlier or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to show us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them changed while I was still in the line .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and took no pleasure in it , which is why he gra@@ bbed an electrically charged rod for the next time .
electricity poured out my entire body , enough to store my entire district .
my half naked body lying on the floor was the perfect power conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two horrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which occurred to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fearful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always set me free .
where do they lead me ? !
Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about LG@@ BT@@ Q + community rights , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he drops to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips covered with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top@@ most floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmers ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist opposed to the conservative majority and questioned its well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed music .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his home town of Am@@ man , but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to Sri Lanka .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his mind , and according to his own statement he can sympath@@ ize with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he has a particular a@@ version against U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; he describes himself even when he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a human being , while in water he po@@ urs over Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the lu@@ sts of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ ron of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose first of all speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a jail in the open air , especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to avoid doing basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - not to land in prison .
recently the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan had cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert statement .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which makes the old @-@ established legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continued to &quot; stand up for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement may not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an ever more clearly emerging reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b drew traditional gender norms to Lei@@ be by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should really trust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Jordan , the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a 1954 Act on the Break@@ ing of Crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be held in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expenditure , as well as the guarantee on the part of the family , are necessary for the woman to do nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music is very popular and is well @-@ known for not shy away from topics that have long been considered t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b denied that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politics was introduced to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tac@@ kles the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ ander . &quot;
in this song one verse is repeated conspic@@ u@@ ously often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - whether it is faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality .
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about gay rights and les@@ bians , and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to later point out that his comments were torn out of context , twisted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded with no cuts , but scattered but only a revised version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b adverti@@ ses the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not ent@@ ail Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ eva , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains remembered , thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ is , who would later work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can &apos;t Jordan do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former members of the government and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that in social media comment@@ aries were critical of the problems associated with deep @-@ rooted corruption .
in view of this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs believes that only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to create a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has prevented M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s what H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also about &quot; experiencing it . &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached with a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions , and artificial forms of demo@@ cra@@ cies . at the very least , it hopes this .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one susp@@ ects that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the ban@@ gs , the drums and dancing have been handed over over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan walked into the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab a few great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a community center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two solid cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only True - and in addition a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of an 18 @-@ metre @-@ high solid car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , outward appearances and personal care were as important as in this story because they help to keep Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dresser .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population in this region does not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and thus also the fallen hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as can be seen in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dres@@ sers instead of bad advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its achievements :
in 1995 we were the only specialized school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built this education community out of love for the children .
Colombia : letter of love to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; love messages to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important to accommodate people who feel po@@ ison@@ ous ?
this was exactly the question of the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ á Foundation and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Cart@@ a p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ ación Camp@@ a@@ ign , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
only recently was their country the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC gu@@ erri@@ lla movement , which is the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the sign of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , before the Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years , exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carrying out their weapons around the clock must now re@@ integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take up their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would have to close together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society .
the target of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who will then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more urgently .
he plans to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year .
thus , the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now , more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ a .
&apos;@@ I never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ á Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC have set up as they did before to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the policy student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a staff member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter made me move through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ gren@@ ade , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never written such a beautiful thing in my life , so I reply to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , he was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
so far I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now where there is peace , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
at the start , students and some F@@ ARC leaders came together for a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in hiding .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC have declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have witnessed the social injustice on the part of the State on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help shape society in this country more equ@@ itably .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often saw and hated as monsters , were also only people with beautiful feelings that were turned up@@ side down by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and embrace .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter :
colum@@ bi@@ ans were proph@@ esi@@ ed that peace would prevail after dis@@ arming .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to resort to arms , raise themselves and protest for their rights . and this is also fully justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC now put on peace , a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those dre@@ aming of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice , for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence become many difficulties im@@ pending .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region face a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs on the LG@@ BT@@ Q community at the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not only come into existence overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
several months ago , the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines after a report has been published that addresses the deportation , torture and kill@@ ings of qu@@ eer men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested susp@@ ects of qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ women , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
she had already felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned about the gender balance of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
she moved out of fear about her life in the end to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while trying to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos from my documents throughout W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the rounds .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was picking up a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
then I heard another sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you still want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you shame ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
apparently , some women had got everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two spi@@ kes in my right lung .
OC Media : in which case wings were you laid - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out of date , there is my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February , I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
they presented absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running at the top without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny saying that I hadn &apos;t changed my gender , that everything was just bad talk , and Phot@@ os@@ hop .
I have cup size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family manage to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has disappointed not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she laid a rope around his neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window stood a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was a bit lazy .
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
app@@ endi@@ x Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something im@@ plau@@ sible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without registering at me , without identification , without all .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe me , you &apos;re sure just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you are in . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , it is a t@@ abo@@ o theme .
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements still carry me in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to avoid hur@@ ting her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when chat@@ ting with camera , I really bother to look at the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to someone who has been eating in ar@@ gun for one and a half months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are not very many .
if , above all , those who have no wealthy relatives or who were dropped from their relatives in order to face Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people had not simply disappeared , they were deliberately sub@@ merged to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken away .
until now , however , they were not introduced as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports about this yet . but we assume that such actions are quite possible .
why would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already took place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think I was already known in the whole of Gro@@ z@@ ny before 2003 when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
serious in serious !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was a sh@@ aria , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
Russia originally wanted to introduce us to &quot; civil@@ isation , &quot; but eventually rejected us into the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is it possible under the law of sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were hat@@ ched ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore tube jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Health of Sh@@ aria has never even cur@@ bed my hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this Gn@@ ome time last ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality in television .
he did not speak about us per se , but above all about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - one could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who had smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed beforehand looked at you at once with suspicion .
in that time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic steadily worsen@@ ing .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA are not much .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ es , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food types .
I have not paid a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I cl@@ apped some kind of refuge .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
app@@ endi@@ x Media : are you wearing a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth , that there are no ow@@ ls with them .
the D@@ age@@ stan , the Kab@@ ard@@ ines , have what , the Russians have whatever ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet here so many men out of the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who walk to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think about men who love males and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;m going to be here so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
there has been a strong rise of suicide since the last few months .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that could arise for his family , so Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id mani@@ an , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have appe@@ aled .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families on account of the persecution of the Iranian government , and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffers from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy was taking power and in 1925 saw great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most productive and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture .
in spite of these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little of that wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ ra@@ zi @-@ Arabs working places in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a multitude of dam@@ s , which diver@@ t water from the Arab areas into the Persian countryside , where the provinces are Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ k adolescents has now increased to 81 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director of Co@@ operatives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job completed primary school , 55 % completed secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ mb@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ ra@@ z &apos;s new ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their living outside their home country .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ ra@@ zi and be stopped , as even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing .
given the circumstances that the Ah@@ ra@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists are aler@@ ted before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ fo@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions , in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists .
for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men nowadays .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to speak on skin color , to black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in racial separation and discrimination , in both as well as outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence there is an institution@@ alised form of racial violence that we are exposed to black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or about that black women and women of other ethnic and country of origin earn less than white men and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin colour to have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I can not join a movement in which the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injusti@@ ces in her thinking , which refer to both the sex and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to perpet@@ u@@ ate an ideology in which the black woman is in historical terms a de@@ mented and margin@@ alized Being .
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their ego@@ centric programme .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ lap of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to instruc@@ t them of the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different income a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and join me in the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than using me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming ( e.g. : Africa W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can up@@ lift black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognised as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life has neither ignored , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published in En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published in particular on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article is re@@ published here .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past seven years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in Kan@@ u - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary about E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ sports Alliance - who advoc@@ ates and works to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ arises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work on a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , an in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work is on persecuted , poorly paid sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques , with whose help oppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their grief over the women mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wil@@ li@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ lt ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police inspec@@ tor , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , said that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent towards her .
since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done .
as another wife of Bal@@ bu@@ ena pointed to mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez also reported nothing .
a few days later , the second woman drew back her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women make a refund at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence must be reported to law enforcement agencies .
cont@@ ent@@ s@@ 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ cs 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that has nothing inferior to Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate implementation of pun@@ ches and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studio , a social science research facility in Paraguay . &quot; there are different data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are al@@ arming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney filed 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the advertisements were reported by women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts . here , too , 86 % of the advertisements were made by women .
in the advertisements 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister , Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; for every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay due to psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a crime of its own , law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year .
by August 2016 alone , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the human rights coordinator in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay all ten days die of violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became a friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want it , but then she asked .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer collabor@@ ating with Carlos . but for two years she has endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise :
I would never have thought that I would be a victim of abuse once .
when I read about it , I always thought that it only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote articles on Facebook , in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had been attracted by Carlos for so long and did not leave him in the past .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that the victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women , who are all victims of abuse in some way .
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the testim@@ onies of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal fight between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly concerned about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the indication of abuse is a way of resist@@ ing and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill of law was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # für@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ income ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the bill fores@@ ees Fem@@ ini@@ d to declare a perpet@@ ual criminal offen@@ se and to punish it harder than the case already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the law text was changed in a number of points , in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law that would be denied the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently banned in Paraguay and pun@@ ishable with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had intended to pay much of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence themselves have to bear , if they simply submit an ad and want to obtain a safe accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter @-@ human relationships .
here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer seen as normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever is silent in the face of these facts is complic@@ it and helps the perpetr@@ ators get away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to refund so long that mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed by the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been changed . among other things , a passage was cancelled which called the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconci@@ le .
the opinions on the changes are taking apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the submission of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back .
this article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wil@@ li@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ lt ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
independent media in Oman one year after a newspaper banned attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website has been locked on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the om@@ anic authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he is serving a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later released .
Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had put his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic intelligence , public freedom , including freedom of press , restric@@ ting and det@@ ain@@ ing human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , also activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors , last year , is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces seized I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor in chief of Az@@ am@@ n , after having published an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking Parties to the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance case .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was sum@@ mon@@ ed to the Special Department by the ISS and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS captured the Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as chief editor at Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; publication and distribution of the newspaper was prohibited by any means , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison and also ordered the newspaper &apos;s final closure .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of infrin@@ gement of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) , and a one @-@ year ban imposed on the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
a security deposit was set for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in the amount of 5000 US dollars ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ oun@@ cement of the sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced el @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following a six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central Pris@@ on . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison , where he is serving his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Afgh@@ an government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to allow publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing shut@@ down of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently bre@@ ached the freedom of the press .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper to stop its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Venetian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the press freedom .
Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is calling for the Venetian authorities to :
1 . immediate and unconditional release of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that its journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances , ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial troubles .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports and provides protection to human rights def@@ enders ( independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and neighbouring countries .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on @-@ site : firstly , the global healthcare sector lacks many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists is helping to develop its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of central lab at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic revealed first serious effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the Sam@@ bian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . in doing so , I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens .
GV : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always stay bene@@ fici@@ aries instead of being a mo@@ ver myself .
the solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
lab material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific education starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa over Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often , it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges challenges here .
the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research .
from the US to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many different kinds of salads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding .
the patents applied not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cur@@ led leaves .
over the past few years , more and more patents are applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ ons . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition Mor@@ ton is still breeding a salad , but it takes longer as his work is becoming more and more difficult due to the increasing restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a b@@ oul@@ der in a river would lie in order that I have to p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads .
and when they stand in front of the court , no one can breed a new type of let@@ tu@@ ce , because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot; he continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed the characteristics he wants .
however , he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and around the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts at the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman Sal@@ at of the Out@@ red@@ geous variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . it is used to test whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for Open Source Se@@ eds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders only allow others to cross their seeds in order to breed their own varieties and do not immediately issue it - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seed , according to him , plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or little by raising seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasizes that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , &quot; he says , and refers to the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry . &quot; those who want to buy good locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seed is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seeds remain freely available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seeds and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool shr@@ inks continuously due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus becoming more limited .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with a genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found that about one third of all the anti@@ trust features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be used at all or only difficult .
for other plants , such estimates do not yet exist , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are grown so that they have specific desired traits - from those through which their taste or colour improves to such as they thri@@ ve in certain environments and can withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders leaves more and more patents . genetic diversity is at present more needed than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse .
in an email , Mon@@ san@@ to recognizes C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and also essential for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
however , it contradic@@ ts the notion that Intel@@ lec@@ tual Property offers other breeders , because &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , it promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this differently : waiting for 20 years , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed crops that are adapted to changing environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the features ourselves .
the plants form it themselves and as breeders , we have no idea how the plants do this .
a mystery to nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , Plant bree@@ der in the US state Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ Board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who bred a variety also breeds its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation it is necessary to produce mass her@@ bi@@ cides , breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such as moving on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are patents ) , most smaller seed companies can also survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
Mor@@ ton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors will sell my grades for themselves in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , which makes it very easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide response
although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is introducing an open @-@ source seed program . to preserve the seeds of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment to breeders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding are different from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the European Commission &apos;s executive , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able , thus addressing the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
an explanation , however , is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for seed pat@@ enting .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Open Source seed systems program , explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open @-@ source seed systems to be the official starting signal for the next year .
an association of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - published a report . it believes that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve seed policy , thereby ensuring a stable supply of food .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a link that Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see more people soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and organic food has largely paid attention to where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people realize that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest cens@@ orship objectives in Egypt
still , the Egyptian authorities have been blocking content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5th August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about the above .
August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed sharply for this step and promised to continue working and efforts on human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains true to its aim to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world and to give victims a voice . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored site of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era due to the alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of website closures to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources of human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer has access to Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes for in Egypt non @-@ accessible websites and media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government &apos;s cens@@ orship was even the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider that is also home to Zi@@ adas blog , however , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , reporting about the student protests and taking a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada comments on the government &apos;s distortion and reflected what this means for him :
to lock blo@@ gs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) They managed to convey to me the feeling of a siege . an arrest , an attempted murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other website I worked for .
2 ) You have proven that I didn &apos;t write for nothing . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now , after locking it and that they &apos;re afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the courageous go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities closed off from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
also documented the closure of providers , through the circum@@ vention of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing was possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content that could have access to Egyptian users .
in addition , the situation is exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are being taken behind closed doors , making the Egyptian population no legal basis by which they can proceed against these actions in court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day after day newspapers in Brazil speak with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer will be murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves rough pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers to the army , na@@ vy and air coffee to Rio . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached its highest level in Rio for 10 years .
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper said the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the Colum@@ ns &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to cry : this is not normal !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a four @-@ minute video sharing on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor in chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision is not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
an extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war crime in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist says that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is distorted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it uses ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira is argu@@ ing that violence is a &quot; war . &quot; this is in her opinion a justification for the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to give accoun@@ tability to the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as indicated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service .
a reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country according to statistics from 2015 . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia stresses , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , was also part of these security policy measures .
in the beginning , this resulted in a decrease of violent deaths . after several years , however , after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 , explaining why the violence in Rio doesn &apos;t correspond to the criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also ent@@ ails serious consequences for people .
this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost bul@@ lets . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the people of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
a week ago , the police cleared the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ u@@ cin@@ ho in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence this incident made head@@ lines : a fruit vendor died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to the victory of Watch , a common initiative of the PA@@ X peace organization and the Syria Institute for the Research Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly severely affected where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations , and the Syrian opposition , based on investigations into the United Nations and other human rights organisations , assume that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under siege from Damascus , which led residents to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points .
through years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics are teaching the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as how to plant their own fungi as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project jointly with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . their food , however , makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ torate of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said in front of the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can be planted in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to introduce this project and expressed his relief that it is becoming more and more known . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crowd funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to teach 125 families to cultivate mushrooms , says Dr. Lei@@ la at Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of this article , they reached more than 100 % of their expected target of about 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to raise funds on Can@@ Do by Monday , 4 September 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said that they started with the &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds originating from the regions &quot; before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a bigger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after 3 months , fungi have been distributed free of charge everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by eating lef@@ to@@ ver lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the production of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities , who are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world , so that our success as well as our struggle against hunger and siege becomes visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interview with Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la was conducted by Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b and translated by Elias A@@ bo@@ u Ja@@ ou@@ de .
Portuguese calls for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21 in many district capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October . this caused the government to call for a state shower last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 erup@@ tions spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors forest areas by satellite images , around 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

numerous videos spread on the net and show pictures that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire prevention measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the scale of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the Con@@ federation of farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did nowhere : there are dozens of open roads that were enclosed by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits are questioned in locations with a high risk of fire .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the shape of the whale , which the government introduced after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law that allowed building activity to fall when the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continues in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of light flamm@@ able wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , to fires of this type .
in addition to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when citizens sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population , using the application fo@@ ve@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was so crucial at this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers failed to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the site counted more than half a million hits .

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , stayed in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother did not say so at that time , she knew she would no longer see her son - perhaps no more .
at dawn , the boy should break .
his uncle would pick it up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ one party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban , and many of Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k returned to Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his modest wage and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and slu@@ gg@@ ish sacks with mort@@ ars who were heavier than himself to earn his living .
back then , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , where we also worked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no services and no heating there . we hung N@@ ylon at the open windows so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
during a dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 .
some time ago A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid in need twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high ratings , Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers . but it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country find are disa@@ strous .
the Human Rights Organization Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
that &apos;s how it happened .
but his unt@@ amed ré@@ gi@@ me helped to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions soon .
after having worked for several years in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k spent his entire savings in establishing a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bite .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary entitled &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ an @-@ powered companies , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants have been created .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant ori@@ ent Experience where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the different Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals reach far beyond the Italian hospitality trade and the retail trade and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know that my people are suffering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also plans to open a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; this is how they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy &apos;s Ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , wins and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority .
in order to be able to use social networks , users must register within six months of their full name and identity within six months of their full name and identity .
if you miss this step , you may be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or pen@@ alties pending .
the law , which was promoted by 60 members of Parliament , is currently under legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
in May another member of Parliament submitted a legislative proposal to introduce stric@@ ter pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the President or a senior official .
under the law proposed , such action would , however , be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this may mean up to three years in prison for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he shot Egyptian polic@@ emen , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators demonstrating against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , just as more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested in the same incident four years in prison on a court date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison administration , according to the human rights groups , failed to bring the defend@@ ant from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ cane threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree on pseu@@ do @-@ possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza revealed the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were accused of reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si &apos;s sitting block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the pun@@ ishments of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
interro@@ gated Tunisi@@ an activists on backed documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated by a res@@ ett@@ led action plan . according to the plan , the President of the Republic , which explicitly supported a controversial draft bill , would ensure am@@ nesty for business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali , provided they return all un@@ lawful mon@@ ies .
the document published on 21 April on the web site of Na@@ wa@@ at casts a light on how the Prime Minister looks like to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources under Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which journalists have granted the right to protect their sources .
despite this , he appeared in the district court in Tunis on May 9 as a witness .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification ?
according to the new rules of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media .
it is also stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts are suggest@@ ing that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks should be achieved . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will we then see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
not in Russia !
may the State cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ cab@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of the information distribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 Act , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the publication of information . the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force it on request to susp@@ end user data .
websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ ctu@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services belong to these websites .
Turkish court features Sper@@ m Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as locking in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications called on the site to be blocked because it became &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ates with groups to insti@@ gate a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is , besides , China , one of the few countries around the world in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain cannot stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor real @-@ time communications and install the data encryption programs .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies with regard to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
